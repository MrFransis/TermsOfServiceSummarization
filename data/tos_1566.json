conformity with the applicable Documentation.\nIntercom's sole liability (and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty will be, at no charge to Customer, for Intercom to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the reported non-conformity, or if Intercom determines such remedy to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and Customer will receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of such Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.\nThe limited warranty set forth in this Section 9.1 will not apply: (i) unless Customer makes a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which Customer first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the error was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party hardware, software or services, or (iii) to use provided on a no-charge, trial or evaluation basis.</p>\n<p>9.2.&nbsp;<strong>Warranty Disclaimer</strong>&nbsp;.\nEXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 9.1, ALL Services and PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nNEITHER INTERCOM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIntercom does not warrant that Customer's use of THE ServiceS will be uninterrupted or error-free, nor does Intercom warrant that it will review the Customer Data for accuracy or that it will preserve or maintain the Customer Data without loss OR CORRUPTION.\nINTERCOM SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE RESULTS OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS SENT OR ANY COMMUNICATIONS THAT WERE FAILED TO BE SENT USING THE SERVICES.\nIntercom SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF Intercom.\nCUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>10.\nAvailability and Service Credits<p>The Services are available subject to&nbsp;Intercom's Service Level Agreement.&nbsp;(\"<strong>SLA</strong>\").</p>11.\nSupport<p>During the Subscription Term of each Service, Intercom will provide end user support in accordance with Intercom's&nbsp;Support Policy&nbsp;(\"<strong>Support Policy</strong>\").</p>12.\nProfessional Services<p>Intercom will provide the professional consulting services (\"<strong>Professional Services</strong>\") purchased in the applicable Order Form.\nThe scope of Professional Services will be as set forth in a Statement of Work referencing this Agreement and executed by both parties describing the work to be performed, fees and any applicable milestones, dependencies and other technical specifications or related information (\"<strong>SOW</strong>\").\nUnless Professional Services are provided on a fixed-fee basis, Customer will pay Intercom at the per-hour rates set forth in the Order Form (or, if not specified, at Intercom's then-standard rates) for any excess services.\nCustomer will reimburse Intercom for reasonable travel and lodging expenses as incurred.\nCustomer may use anything delivered as part of the Professional Services in support of authorized use of the Services and subject to the terms regarding Customer's rights to use the Service set forth in Section 2

thereof created by Intercom (or its agents).</p>13.\nLimitation of Remedies and Damages<p>13.1.&nbsp;<strong>Consequential Damages Waiver.&nbsp;</strong>EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.</p>\n<p>13.2.&nbsp;<strong>Liability Cap.&nbsp;</strong>INTERCOM'S AND ITS SUPPLIERS' ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER TO INTERCOM DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>13.3.&nbsp;<strong>Excluded Claims.&nbsp;</strong>\"<strong>Excluded Claims</strong>\" means any claim arising (a) from Customer's breach of Section 2.7 (General Restrictions).\n(b) under Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations) or 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer).\nor (c) from a party's breach of its obligations in Section 15 (Confidential Information) (but excluding claims arising from operation or non-operation of any Service).</p>\n<p>13.4.&nbsp;<strong>Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose</strong>.\nThe parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 13 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contact, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>14.\nIndemnification<p>Intercom will defend Customer from and against any claim by a third party alleging that a Service when used as authorized under this Agreement infringes a U.S.\npatent, U.S.\ncopyright, or U.S.\ntrademark and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages and costs finally awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by Intercom (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from such claim, provided that Intercom will have received from Customer: (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Intercom to respond without prejudice).\n(ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim.\nand (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer.\nIf Customer's use of a Service is (or in Intercom's opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if Intercom determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, Intercom may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services.\n(b) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Service.\nor if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer the fees paid by Customer for the portion of the Subscription Term that was paid by Customer but not rendered by Intercom.\nThe foregoing indemnification obligation of Intercom will not apply: (1) if such Service is modified by any party other than Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification.\n(2) if such Service is combined with products or processes not provided by Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination.\n(3) to any unauthorized use of such Service.\n(4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Data or any third-party deliverables or components contained within such Service.\n(5) to the extent the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular technology or implementation of the Service but instead by features common to any similar product or service.\nor (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without Intercom's prior written consent.\nTHIS SECTION 14 SETS FORTH Intercom's AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.</p>15.\nConfidential Information<p>Each party (as \"<strong>Receiving Party</strong>\") agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (\"<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>\") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (\"<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny Intercom Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Intercom without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Intercom, the subcontractors referenced in Section 17.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 15 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>16.\nCo-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release (\"<strong>Press Release</strong>\") on a mutually agreed upon date or the 90th day from the Effective Date, whichever is earlier.\nEach party will have the right to approve the Press Release in advance, but such approval will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\nCustomer also agrees to participate in other reasonable marketing activities that promote the benefits of the Services to other potential customers and to use of Customer's name and logo on Intercom's web site and in Intercom promotional materials.\nCustomer agrees that Intercom may disclose Customer as a customer of Intercom.</p>17.\nGeneral Terms<p>17.1.&nbsp;<strong>Assignment</strong>&nbsp;.\nThis Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns.\nNeither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party's assets or voting securities.\nAny attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 17.1 will be null and void.</p>\n<p>17.2.&nbsp;<strong>Severability</strong>.\nIf any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.</p>\n<p>17.3.&nbsp;<strong>Governing Law.\nDispute Resolution</strong>.</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;Direct

document specifically entitled \"Initial Notice of Dispute,\" specifically setting forth the precise nature of the dispute (\"<strong>Initial Notice of Dispute</strong>\").\nIf an Initial Notice of Dispute is being sent to Intercom it must be emailed to legal@intercom.io and sent via mail to:</p>\n<p>Attn: Legal Department Intercom 55 Second Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94105</p>\n<p>Following receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the Dispute that is satisfactory to both parties (\"<strong>Direct Dispute Resolution</strong>\").\nIf the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the Dispute through Direct Dispute Resolution within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, then the Dispute shall subsequently be resolved by arbitration as set forth below.</p>\n<p>b)&nbsp;Arbitration.\nIN THE EVENT THAT A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES CANNOT BE SETTLED THROUGH DIRECT DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO

limitation of one discovery deposition per side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted.\nThe arbitrator shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing.\nAny issue concerning the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, the applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of this agreement shall be resolved by the arbitrator.\nTo the extent state law is applicable, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of California.</p>\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential and neither the parties nor the arbitrators may disclose the content or results of the arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.\nThe result of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration.</p>\n<p>c)&nbsp;Choice of Law and Jurisdiction.\nFOR ANY CLAIM WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, CUSTOMER AGREES TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.\nIN ANY DISPUTE, CALIFORNIA LAW SHALL APPLY.</p>\n<p>d)&nbsp;Construction and Joinder.\nTHIS AGREEMENT MUST BE CONSTRUED AS IF IT WAS JOINTLY WRITTEN BY BOTH PARTIES.\nBOTH CUSTOMER AND INTERCOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS.\nNO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.\nIN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.</p>\n<p>e)&nbsp;Injunctive Relief.\nNotwithstanding the above provisions, Intercom may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>17.4.&nbsp;<strong>Notice</strong>.\nAny notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing to the parties at the addresses set forth on the Order Form or at such other address as may be given in writing by either party to the other in accordance with this Section and will be deemed to have been received by the addressee (i) if given by hand, immediately upon receipt.\n(ii) if given by overnight courier service, the first business day following dispatch or (iii) if given by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, the second business day after such notice is deposited in the mail.</p>\n<p>17.5.&nbsp;<strong>Amendments.\nWaivers</strong>.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, no supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement will be binding, unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement.\nNo waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.\nNo provision of any purchase order or other business form employed by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect.</p>\n<p>17.6.&nbsp;<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>.\nThis Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\nCustomer acknowledges that the Services are on-line, subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved customer experience Intercom may make changes to the Services, and Intercom will update the applicable Documentation accordingly.\nThe support and service level availability terms described in the Support Policy and the SLA may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Intercom's obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).</p>\n<p>17.7.&nbsp;<strong>Force Majeure</strong>.\nNeither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of this Agreement and that are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency.</p>\n<p>17.8.&nbsp;<strong>Subcontractors</strong>&nbsp;.\nIntercom may use the services of

such subcontractor with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) for the overall performance of the Services as required under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>17.9.&nbsp;<strong>Subpoenas</strong>.\nNothing in this Agreement prevents Intercom from disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Intercom will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer where permitted to do so.</p>\n<p>17.10.&nbsp;<strong>Independent Contractors</strong>.\nThe parties to this Agreement are independent contractors.\nThere is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties.\nNeither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party's behalf without the other party's prior written consent</p>\n<p>17.11.&nbsp;<strong>Export Control</strong>.\nIn its use of the Services, Customer agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the United States

click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement before renewing a Subscription Term or entering into a new Order Form, and in any event continued use of the Services after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect will constitute Customer's acceptance of such updated version.\nIf Intercom specifies that changes to the Agreement will take effect prior to Customer's next

obtains from the disclosing party (\"<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>\") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (\"<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny Intercom Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Intercom without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Intercom, the subcontractors referenced in Section 17.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 15 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>16.\nCo-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release (\"<strong>Press Release</strong>\") on a mutually agreed upon date or the 90th day from the Effective Date, whichever is earlier.\nEach party will have the right to approve the Press Release in advance, but such approval will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\nCustomer also agrees to participate in other reasonable marketing activities that promote the benefits of the Services to other potential customers and to use of Customer's name and logo on Intercom's web site and in Intercom promotional materials.\nCustomer agrees that Intercom may disclose Customer as a customer of Intercom.</p>17.\nGeneral

void.</p>\n<p>17.2.&nbsp;<strong>Severability</strong>.\nIf any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.</p>\n<p>17.3.&nbsp;<strong>Governing Law.\nDispute Resolution</strong>.</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;Direct

and equitable solution of the Dispute that is satisfactory to both parties (\"<strong>Direct Dispute Resolution</strong>\").\nIf the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the Dispute through

limitation of one discovery deposition per side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted.\nThe arbitrator shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing.\nAny issue concerning the extent to which

award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration.</p>\n<p>c)&nbsp;Choice of Law and Jurisdiction.\nFOR ANY CLAIM WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, CUSTOMER AGREES TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE

ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.</p>\n<p>e)&nbsp;Injunctive Relief.\nNotwithstanding the

effect.</p>\n<p>17.6.&nbsp;<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>.\nThis Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\nCustomer acknowledges that the Services are on-line, subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved customer experience Intercom may make changes to the Services, and Intercom will update the applicable Documentation accordingly.\nThe support and service level availability terms described in the Support Policy and the SLA may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not

the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of

responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no

in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>16.\nCo-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release (\"<strong>Press Release</strong>\") on a mutually agreed upon date or

shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing.\nAny issue concerning the extent to which

to the Services and all Documentation, professional services deliverables and any and all related and underlying technology and documentation and any derivative works, modifications or improvements of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate Feedback (collectively, \"<strong>Intercom Technology</strong>\").\nExcept as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no rights in any Intercom Technology are granted to Customer.\nFurther, Customer acknowledges that the Services are offered as an on-line, hosted solution, and that Customer has no right to obtain a copy of any of the Services, except for Intercom Code and the Intercom Apps in the format provided by Intercom.</p>\n<p>6.2.&nbsp;<strong>Feedback</strong>.\nCustomer, from time to time, may submit Feedback to Intercom.\nIntercom may freely use or exploit Feedback in connection with any of its products or services.</p>7.\nSubscription Term, Fees &amp.\nPayment<p>7.1.&nbsp;<strong>Subscription Term and Renewals</strong>.\nUnless otherwise specified on the applicable Order Form, each Subscription Term will automatically renew for additional twelve month periods unless either party gives the other written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the then-current Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>7.2.&nbsp;<strong>Fees and Payment</strong>&nbsp;.\nAll fees are as set forth in the applicable Order Form and will be paid by Customer within thirty (30) days of invoice, unless (a) Customer is paying via Credit Card (as defined below) or (b) otherwise specified in the applicable Order Form.\nExcept as expressly set forth in Section 9 (Limited Warranty) and Section 14 (Indemnification), all fees are non-refundable.\nThe rates in the Order Form are valid for the initial twelve (12) month period of each Subscription Term and thereafter may be subject to an automatic adjustment increase of up to ten percent (10%) per year.\nCustomer is responsible for paying all Taxes, and all Taxes are excluded from any fees set forth in the applicable Order Form.\nIf Customer is required by Law to withhold any Taxes from Customer's payment, the fees payable by Customer will be increased as necessary so that after making any required withholdings, Intercom receives and retains (free from any liability for payment of Taxes) an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such withholdings been made.\nAny late payments will be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.</p>\n<p>7.3.&nbsp;<strong>Payment Via Credit Card.</strong>&nbsp;If you are purchasing the Services via credit card, debit card or other payment card (\"Credit Card\"), the following terms apply:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Recurring Billing Authorization.\nBy providing Credit Card information and agreeing to purchase any Services, Customer hereby authorizes Intercom (or its designee) to automatically charge Customer's Credit Card on the same date of each calendar month (or the closest prior date, if there are fewer days in a particular month) during the Subscription Term for all fees accrued as of that date (if any) in accordance with the applicable Order Form.\nCustomer acknowledges and agrees that the amount billed and charged each month may vary depending on Customer's use of the Services and may include subscription fees for the remainder of Customer's applicable billing period and overage fees for the prior month.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Foreign Transaction Fees.\nCustomer acknowledges that for certain Credit Cards, the issuer of Customer's Credit Card may charge a foreign transaction fee or other charges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Invalid Payment.\nIf a payment is not successfully settled due to expiration of a Credit Card, insufficient funds, or otherwise, Customer remains responsible for any amounts not remitted to Intercom and Intercom may, in its sole discretion, either (i) invoice Customer directly for the deficient amount, (ii) continue billing the Credit Card once it has been updated by Customer (if applicable) or (iii) terminate this Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changing Credit Card Information.&nbsp;At any time, Customer may change its Credit Card information by entering updated Credit Card information via the \"Settings\" page on the Dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Termination of Recurring Billing.&nbsp;In addition to any termination rights set forth in this Agreement, Customer may terminate the Subscription Term by sending Intercom notice of non-renewal to in accordance with Section 7.1 (Subscription Term and Renewals) or, if Customer's Subscription Term is on a monthly basis (or if otherwise permitted by Intercom), by terminating via the \"Settings\" page on the Dashboard, with termination effective at the end of the current Subscription Term.\nAs set forth in Section 2.9 (Trial Subscriptions), if Customer does not enter into a paid Subscription Term following a Trial Period, this Agreement and Customer's right to access and use the Services will terminate at the end of the Trial Period and Customer's Credit Card will not be charged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payment of Outstanding Fees.&nbsp;Upon any termination or expiration of the Subscription Term, Intercom will charge Customer's Credit Card (or invoice Customer directly) for any outstanding fees for Customer's use of the Services during the Subscription Term, after which Intercom will not charge Customer's Credit Card for any additional fees.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>7.4.&nbsp;<strong>Suspension of Service</strong>.\nIf Customer's account is thirty (30) days or more overdue, in addition to any of its other rights or remedies (including but not limited to any termination rights set forth herein), Intercom reserves the right to suspend Customer's access to the applicable Service (and any related services) without liability to Customer until such amounts are paid in full.\nIntercom also reserves the right to suspend Customer's access to the Services without liability to Customer if Customer's use of the Services is in violation of the AUP.</p>8.\nTerm and Termination<p>8.1.&nbsp;<strong>Term</strong>.\nThis Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and expires on the date of expiration or termination of all Subscription Terms.</p>\n<p>8.2.&nbsp;<strong>Termination for Cause</strong>.\nEither party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice.\n(b) ceases operation without a successor.\nor (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors' arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).</p>\n<p>8.3.&nbsp;<strong>Effect of Termination</strong>.\nUpon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, Customer will immediately cease any and all use of and access to all Services (including any and all related Intercom Technology) and delete (or, at Intercom's request, return) any and all copies of the Documentation, any Intercom passwords or access codes and any other Intercom Confidential Information in its possession.\nProvided this Agreement was not terminated for Customer's breach, Customer may retain and use internally copies of all reports exported from any Service prior to termination.\nCustomer acknowledges that following termination it will have no further access to any Customer Data input into any Service, and that Intercom may delete any such data as may have been stored by Intercom at any time.\nExcept where an exclusive remedy is specified, the exercise of either party of any remedy under this Agreement, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.</p>\n<p>8.4.&nbsp;<strong>Survival</strong>.\nThe following Sections will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 2.7 (General Restrictions), 2.9 (Trial Subscriptions), 3.2 (Storage of Customer Data), 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer), 3.5 (Aggregated Anonymous Data), 6 (Ownership), 7.2 (Fees and Payment), 7.3 (Payment Via Credit Card), 8 (Term and Termination), 9.2 (Warranty Disclaimer), 13 (Limitation of Remedies and Damages), 14 (Indemnification), 15 (Confidential Information) and 17 (General Terms).</p>9.\nLimited Warranty<p>9.1.&nbsp;<strong>Limited Warranty</strong>&nbsp;.\nIntercom warrants, for Customer's benefit only, that each Service will operate in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation.\nIntercom's sole liability (and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty will be, at no charge to Customer, for Intercom to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the reported non-conformity, or if Intercom determines such remedy to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and Customer will receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of such Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.\nThe limited warranty set forth in this Section 9.1 will not apply: (i) unless Customer makes a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which Customer first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the error was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party hardware, software or services, or (iii) to use provided on a no-charge, trial or evaluation basis.</p>\n<p>9.2.&nbsp;<strong>Warranty Disclaimer</strong>&nbsp;.\nEXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 9.1, ALL Services and PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nNEITHER INTERCOM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIntercom does not warrant that Customer's use of THE ServiceS will be uninterrupted or error-free, nor does Intercom warrant that it will review the Customer Data for accuracy or that it will preserve or maintain the Customer Data without loss OR CORRUPTION.\nINTERCOM SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE RESULTS OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS SENT OR ANY COMMUNICATIONS THAT WERE FAILED TO BE SENT USING THE SERVICES.\nIntercom SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF Intercom.\nCUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>10.\nAvailability and Service Credits<p>The Services are available subject to&nbsp;Intercom's Service Level Agreement.&nbsp;(\"<strong>SLA</strong>\").</p>11.\nSupport<p>During the Subscription Term of each Service, Intercom will provide end user support in accordance with Intercom's&nbsp;Support Policy&nbsp;(\"<strong>Support Policy</strong>\").</p>12.\nProfessional Services<p>Intercom will provide the professional consulting services (\"<strong>Professional Services</strong>\") purchased in the applicable Order Form.\nThe scope of Professional Services will be as set forth in a Statement of Work referencing this Agreement and executed by both parties describing the work to be performed, fees and any applicable milestones, dependencies and other technical specifications or related information (\"<strong>SOW</strong>\").\nUnless Professional Services are provided on a fixed-fee basis, Customer will pay Intercom at the per-hour rates set forth in the Order Form (or, if not specified, at Intercom's then-standard rates) for any excess services.\nCustomer will reimburse Intercom for reasonable travel and lodging expenses as incurred.\nCustomer may use anything delivered as part of the Professional Services in support of authorized use of the Services and subject to the terms regarding Customer's rights to use the Service set forth in Section 2 (Intercom Services) and the applicable SOW, but Intercom will retain all right, title and interest in and to any such work product, code or deliverables and any derivative, enhancement or modification thereof created by Intercom (or its agents).</p>13.\nLimitation of Remedies and Damages<p>13.1.&nbsp;<strong>Consequential Damages Waiver.&nbsp;</strong>EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.</p>\n<p>13.2.&nbsp;<strong>Liability Cap.&nbsp;</strong>INTERCOM'S AND ITS SUPPLIERS' ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER TO INTERCOM DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>13.3.&nbsp;<strong>Excluded Claims.&nbsp;</strong>\"<strong>Excluded Claims</strong>\" means any claim arising (a) from Customer's breach of Section 2.7 (General Restrictions).\n(b) under Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations) or 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer).\nor (c) from a party's breach of its obligations in Section 15 (Confidential Information) (but excluding claims arising from operation or non-operation of any Service).</p>\n<p>13.4.&nbsp;<strong>Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose</strong>.\nThe parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 13 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contact, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>14.\nIndemnification<p>Intercom will defend Customer from and against any claim by a third party alleging that a Service when used as authorized under this Agreement infringes a U.S.\npatent, U.S.\ncopyright, or U.S.\ntrademark and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages and costs finally awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by Intercom (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from such claim, provided that Intercom will have received from Customer: (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Intercom to respond without prejudice).\n(ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim.\nand (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer.\nIf Customer's use of a Service is (or in Intercom's opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if Intercom determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, Intercom may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services.\n(b) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Service.\nor if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer the fees paid by Customer for the portion of the Subscription Term that was paid by Customer but not rendered by Intercom.\nThe foregoing indemnification obligation of Intercom will not apply: (1) if such Service is modified by any party other than Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification.\n(2) if such Service is combined with products or processes not provided by Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination.\n(3) to any unauthorized use of such Service.\n(4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Data or any third-party deliverables or components contained within such Service.\n(5) to the extent the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular technology or implementation of the Service but instead by features common to any similar product or service.\nor (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without Intercom's prior written consent.\nTHIS SECTION 14 SETS FORTH Intercom's AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.</p>15.\nConfidential Information<p>Each party (as \"<strong>Receiving Party</strong>\") agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (\"<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>\") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (\"<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny Intercom Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Intercom without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Intercom, the subcontractors referenced in Section 17.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 15 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>16.\nCo-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release (\"<strong>Press Release</strong>\") on a mutually agreed upon date or the 90th day from the Effective Date, whichever is earlier.\nEach party will have the right to approve the Press Release in advance, but such approval will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\nCustomer also agrees to participate in other reasonable marketing activities that promote the benefits of the Services to other potential customers and to use of Customer's name and logo on Intercom's web site and in Intercom promotional materials.\nCustomer agrees that Intercom may disclose Customer as a customer of Intercom.</p>17.\nGeneral Terms<p>17.1.&nbsp;<strong>Assignment</strong>&nbsp;.\nThis Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns.\nNeither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party's assets or voting securities.\nAny attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 17.1 will be null and void.</p>\n<p>17.2.&nbsp;<strong>Severability</strong>.\nIf any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.</p>\n<p>17.3.&nbsp;<strong>Governing Law.\nDispute Resolution</strong>.</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;Direct Dispute Resolution.\nIn the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to this Agreement, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, (\"<strong>Dispute</strong>\"), the parties shall first use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute.\nIf a Dispute arises, the complaining party shall provide written notice to the other party in a document specifically entitled \"Initial Notice of Dispute,\" specifically setting forth the precise nature of the dispute (\"<strong>Initial Notice of Dispute</strong>\").\nIf an Initial Notice of Dispute is being sent to Intercom it must be emailed to legal@intercom.io and sent via mail to:</p>\n<p>Attn: Legal Department Intercom 55 Second Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94105</p>\n<p>Following receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the Dispute that is satisfactory to both parties (\"<strong>Direct Dispute Resolution</strong>\").\nIf the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the Dispute through Direct Dispute Resolution within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, then the Dispute shall subsequently be resolved by arbitration as set forth below.</p>\n<p>b)&nbsp;Arbitration.\nIN THE EVENT THAT A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES CANNOT BE SETTLED THROUGH DIRECT DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO

Francisco, California.\nThe arbitration shall be administered by JAMS in accordance with this document and the JAMS Streamlined Rules and Procedures for the Arbitration, with one addition: The limitation of one discovery deposition per side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted.\nThe arbitrator shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing.\nAny issue concerning the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, the applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of this agreement shall be resolved by the arbitrator.\nTo the extent state law is applicable, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of California.</p>\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential and neither the parties nor the arbitrators may disclose the content or results of the arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.\nThe result of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration.</p>\n<p>c)&nbsp;Choice of Law and Jurisdiction.\nFOR ANY CLAIM WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, CUSTOMER AGREES TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.\nIN ANY DISPUTE, CALIFORNIA LAW SHALL APPLY.</p>\n<p>d)&nbsp;Construction and Joinder.\nTHIS AGREEMENT MUST BE CONSTRUED AS IF IT WAS JOINTLY WRITTEN BY BOTH PARTIES.\nBOTH CUSTOMER AND INTERCOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS.\nNO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.\nIN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.</p>\n<p>e)&nbsp;Injunctive Relief.\nNotwithstanding the above provisions, Intercom may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>17.4.&nbsp;<strong>Notice</strong>.\nAny notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing to the parties at the addresses set forth on the Order Form or at such other address as may be given in writing by either party to the other in accordance with this Section and will be deemed to have been received by the addressee (i) if given by hand, immediately upon receipt.\n(ii) if given by overnight courier service, the first business day following dispatch or (iii) if given by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, the second business day after such notice is deposited in the mail.</p>\n<p>17.5.&nbsp;<strong>Amendments.\nWaivers</strong>.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, no supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement will be binding, unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement.\nNo waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.\nNo provision of any purchase order or other business form employed by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect.</p>\n<p>17.6.&nbsp;<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>.\nThis Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\nCustomer acknowledges that the Services are on-line, subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved customer experience Intercom may make changes to the Services, and Intercom will update the applicable Documentation accordingly.\nThe support and service level availability terms described in the Support Policy and the SLA may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Intercom's obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).</p>\n<p>17.7.&nbsp;<strong>Force Majeure</strong>.\nNeither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of this Agreement and that are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency.</p>\n<p>17.8.&nbsp;<strong>Subcontractors</strong>&nbsp;.\nIntercom may use the services of subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Intercom in order to provide the Services under this Agreement, provided that Intercom remains responsible for (i) compliance of any such subcontractor with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) for the overall performance of the Services as required under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>17.9.&nbsp;<strong>Subpoenas</strong>.\nNothing in this Agreement prevents Intercom from disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Intercom will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer where permitted to do so.</p>\n<p>17.10.&nbsp;<strong>Independent Contractors</strong>.\nThe parties to this Agreement are independent contractors.\nThere is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties.\nNeither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party's behalf without the other party's prior written consent</p>\n<p>17.11.&nbsp;<strong>Export Control</strong>.\nIn its use of the Services, Customer agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the United States

expense.\nAll other use is prohibited</p>\n<p>17.13.&nbsp;<strong>Counterparts.</strong>&nbsp;This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which

NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.</p>\n<p>13.2.&nbsp;<strong>Liability Cap.&nbsp;</strong>INTERCOM'S AND ITS SUPPLIERS' ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER TO INTERCOM DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>13.3.&nbsp;<strong>Excluded Claims.&nbsp;</strong>\"<strong>Excluded Claims</strong>\" means any claim arising (a) from Customer's breach of Section 2.7 (General Restrictions).\n(b) under Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations) or 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer).\nor (c) from a party's breach of its obligations in Section 15 (Confidential Information) (but excluding claims arising from operation or non-operation of any Service).</p>\n<p>13.4.&nbsp;<strong>Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose</strong>.\nThe parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 13 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contact, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>14.\nIndemnification<p>Intercom will defend Customer from and against any claim by a third party alleging that a Service when used as authorized under this Agreement infringes a U.S.\npatent, U.S.\ncopyright, or U.S.\ntrademark and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages and costs finally awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by Intercom (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from such claim, provided that Intercom will have received from Customer: (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Intercom to respond without prejudice).\n(ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim.\nand (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer.\nIf Customer's use of a Service is (or in Intercom's opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if Intercom determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, Intercom may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services.\n(b) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Service.\nor if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer the fees paid by Customer for the portion of the Subscription Term that was paid by Customer but not rendered by Intercom.\nThe foregoing indemnification obligation of Intercom will not apply: (1) if such Service is modified by any party other than Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification.\n(2) if such Service is combined with products or processes not provided by Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination.\n(3) to any unauthorized use of such Service.\n(4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Data or any third-party deliverables or components contained within such Service.\n(5) to the extent the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular technology or implementation of the Service but instead by features common to any similar product or service.\nor (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without Intercom's prior written consent.\nTHIS SECTION 14 SETS FORTH Intercom's AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.</p>15.\nConfidential Information<p>Each party (as \"<strong>Receiving Party</strong>\") agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (\"<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>\") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (\"<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny Intercom Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Intercom without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Intercom, the subcontractors referenced in Section 17.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 15 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>16.\nCo-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release (\"<strong>Press Release</strong>\") on a mutually agreed upon date or the 90th day from the Effective Date, whichever is earlier.\nEach party will have the right to approve the Press Release in advance, but such approval will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\nCustomer also agrees to participate in other reasonable marketing activities that promote the benefits of the Services to other potential customers and to use of Customer's name and logo on Intercom's web site and in Intercom promotional materials.\nCustomer agrees that Intercom may disclose Customer as a customer of Intercom.</p>17.\nGeneral

substantially all of such party's assets or voting securities.\nAny attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 17.1 will be null and void.</p>\n<p>17.2.&nbsp;<strong>Severability</strong>.\nIf any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.</p>\n<p>17.3.&nbsp;<strong>Governing Law.\nDispute Resolution</strong>.</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;Direct

and equitable solution of the Dispute that is satisfactory to both parties (\"<strong>Direct Dispute Resolution</strong>\").\nIf the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the Dispute through

limitation of one discovery deposition per side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted.\nThe arbitrator shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing.\nAny issue concerning the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, the applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of this agreement shall be resolved by the arbitrator.\nTo the extent state law is applicable, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of California.</p>\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential and neither the parties nor the arbitrators may disclose the content or results of the arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.\nThe result of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration.</p>\n<p>c)&nbsp;Choice of Law and Jurisdiction.\nFOR ANY CLAIM WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, CUSTOMER AGREES TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.\nIN ANY DISPUTE, CALIFORNIA LAW SHALL

ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.\nIN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.</p>\n<p>e)&nbsp;Injunctive Relief.\nNotwithstanding the above provisions, Intercom may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>17.4.&nbsp;<strong>Notice</strong>.\nAny notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing to the parties at the addresses set forth on the Order Form or at such other address as may be given in writing by either

unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement.\nNo waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.\nNo provision of any purchase order or other business form employed by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect.</p>\n<p>17.6.&nbsp;<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>.\nThis Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\nCustomer acknowledges that the Services are on-line, subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved customer experience Intercom may make changes to the Services, and Intercom will update the applicable Documentation accordingly.\nThe support and service level availability terms described in the Support Policy and the SLA may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Intercom's obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).</p>\n<p>17.7.&nbsp;<strong>Force Majeure</strong>.\nNeither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of this Agreement and that are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency.</p>\n<p>17.8.&nbsp;<strong>Subcontractors</strong>&nbsp;.\nIntercom may use the services of

such subcontractor with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) for the overall performance of the Services as required under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>17.9.&nbsp;<strong>Subpoenas</strong>.\nNothing in this Agreement prevents Intercom from disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Intercom will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer where permitted to do so.</p>\n<p>17.10.&nbsp;<strong>Independent Contractors</strong>.\nThe parties to this Agreement are independent contractors.\nThere is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties.\nNeither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party's behalf without the other party's prior written consent</p>\n<p>17.11.&nbsp;<strong>Export Control</strong>.\nIn its use of the Services, Customer agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the United States

is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny Intercom Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Intercom without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential

document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii)

Intercom will not apply: (1) if such Service is modified by any party other than Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification.\n(2) if such Service is combined with products or processes not provided by Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination.\n(3) to any unauthorized use of such Service.\n(4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Data or any third-party deliverables or components contained within such Service.\n(5) to the extent the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular

is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the

17.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 15 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no

in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>16.\nCo-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release (\"<strong>Press Release</strong>\") on a mutually agreed upon date or

the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing.\nAny issue concerning the extent to which

the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of

received had no such withholdings been made.\nAny late payments will be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.</p>\n<p>7.3.&nbsp;<strong>Payment Via Credit Card.</strong>&nbsp;If you are purchasing the Services via credit card, debit card or other payment card (\"Credit Card\"), the following terms apply:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Recurring Billing Authorization.\nBy providing Credit Card information and agreeing to purchase any Services, Customer hereby authorizes Intercom (or its designee) to automatically charge Customer's Credit Card on the same date of each calendar month (or the closest prior date, if there are fewer days in a particular month) during the Subscription Term for all fees accrued as of that date (if any) in accordance with the applicable Order Form.\nCustomer acknowledges and agrees that the amount billed and charged each month may vary depending on Customer's use of the Services and may include subscription fees for the remainder of Customer's applicable billing period and overage fees for the prior month.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Foreign Transaction Fees.\nCustomer acknowledges that for certain Credit Cards, the issuer of Customer's Credit Card may charge a foreign transaction fee or other charges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Invalid Payment.\nIf a payment is not successfully settled due to expiration of a Credit Card, insufficient funds, or otherwise, Customer remains responsible for any amounts not remitted to Intercom and Intercom may, in its sole discretion, either (i) invoice Customer directly for the deficient amount, (ii) continue billing the Credit Card once it has been updated by Customer (if applicable) or (iii) terminate this Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Changing Credit Card Information.&nbsp;At any time, Customer may change its Credit Card information by entering updated Credit Card information via the \"Settings\" page on the Dashboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Termination of Recurring Billing.&nbsp;In addition to any termination rights set forth in this Agreement, Customer may terminate the Subscription Term by sending Intercom notice of non-renewal to in accordance with Section 7.1 (Subscription Term and Renewals) or, if Customer's Subscription Term is on a monthly basis (or if otherwise permitted by Intercom), by terminating via the \"Settings\" page on the Dashboard, with termination effective at the end of the current Subscription Term.\nAs set forth in Section 2.9 (Trial Subscriptions), if Customer does not enter into a paid Subscription Term following a Trial Period, this Agreement and Customer's right to access and use the Services will terminate at the end of the Trial Period and Customer's Credit Card will not be charged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payment of Outstanding Fees.&nbsp;Upon any termination or expiration of the Subscription Term, Intercom will charge Customer's Credit Card (or invoice Customer directly) for any outstanding fees for Customer's use of the Services during the Subscription Term, after which Intercom will not charge Customer's Credit Card for any additional fees.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>7.4.&nbsp;<strong>Suspension of Service</strong>.\nIf Customer's account is thirty (30) days or more overdue, in addition to any of its other rights or remedies (including but not limited to any termination rights set forth herein), Intercom reserves the right to suspend Customer's access to the applicable Service (and any related services) without liability to Customer until such amounts are paid in full.\nIntercom also reserves the right to suspend Customer's access to the Services without liability to Customer if Customer's use of the Services is in violation of the AUP.</p>8.\nTerm and Termination<p>8.1.&nbsp;<strong>Term</strong>.\nThis Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and expires on the date of expiration or termination of all Subscription Terms.</p>\n<p>8.2.&nbsp;<strong>Termination for Cause</strong>.\nEither party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice.\n(b) ceases operation without a successor.\nor (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors' arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).</p>\n<p>8.3.&nbsp;<strong>Effect of Termination</strong>.\nUpon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, Customer will immediately cease any and all use of and access to all Services (including any and all related Intercom Technology) and delete (or, at Intercom's request, return) any and all copies of the Documentation, any Intercom passwords or access codes and any other Intercom Confidential Information in its possession.\nProvided this Agreement was not terminated for Customer's breach, Customer may retain and use internally copies of all reports exported from any Service prior to termination.\nCustomer acknowledges that following termination it will have no further access to any Customer Data input into any Service, and that Intercom may delete any such data as may have been stored by Intercom at any time.\nExcept where an exclusive remedy is specified, the exercise of either party of any remedy under this Agreement, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.</p>\n<p>8.4.&nbsp;<strong>Survival</strong>.\nThe following Sections will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 2.7 (General Restrictions), 2.9 (Trial Subscriptions), 3.2 (Storage of Customer Data), 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer), 3.5 (Aggregated Anonymous Data), 6 (Ownership), 7.2 (Fees and Payment), 7.3 (Payment Via Credit Card), 8 (Term and Termination), 9.2 (Warranty Disclaimer), 13 (Limitation of Remedies and Damages), 14 (Indemnification), 15 (Confidential Information) and 17 (General Terms).</p>9.\nLimited Warranty<p>9.1.&nbsp;<strong>Limited Warranty</strong>&nbsp;.\nIntercom warrants, for Customer's benefit only, that each Service will operate in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation.\nIntercom's sole liability (and Customer's sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty will be, at no charge to Customer, for Intercom to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the reported non-conformity, or if Intercom determines such remedy to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and Customer will receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of such Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.\nThe limited warranty set forth in this Section 9.1 will not apply: (i) unless Customer makes a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which Customer first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the error was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party hardware, software or services, or (iii) to use provided on a no-charge, trial or evaluation basis.</p>\n<p>9.2.&nbsp;<strong>Warranty Disclaimer</strong>&nbsp;.\nEXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 9.1, ALL Services and PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\".\nNEITHER INTERCOM NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIntercom does not warrant that Customer's use of THE ServiceS will be uninterrupted or error-free, nor does Intercom warrant that it will review the Customer Data for accuracy or that it will preserve or maintain the Customer Data without loss OR CORRUPTION.\nINTERCOM SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE RESULTS OF ANY COMMUNICATIONS SENT OR ANY COMMUNICATIONS THAT WERE FAILED TO BE SENT USING THE SERVICES.\nIntercom SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF Intercom.\nCUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>10.\nAvailability and Service Credits<p>The Services are available subject to&nbsp;Intercom's Service Level Agreement.&nbsp;(\"<strong>SLA</strong>\").</p>11.\nSupport<p>During the Subscription Term of each Service, Intercom will provide end user support in accordance with Intercom's&nbsp;Support Policy&nbsp;(\"<strong>Support Policy</strong>\").</p>12.\nProfessional Services<p>Intercom will provide the professional consulting services (\"<strong>Professional Services</strong>\") purchased in the applicable Order Form.\nThe scope of Professional Services will be as set forth in a Statement of Work referencing this Agreement and executed by both parties describing the work to be performed, fees and any applicable milestones, dependencies and other technical specifications or related information (\"<strong>SOW</strong>\").\nUnless Professional Services are provided on a fixed-fee basis, Customer will pay Intercom at the per-hour rates set forth in the Order Form (or, if not specified, at Intercom's then-standard rates) for any excess services.\nCustomer will reimburse Intercom for reasonable travel and lodging expenses as incurred.\nCustomer may use anything delivered as part of the Professional Services in support of authorized use of the Services and subject to the terms regarding Customer's rights to use the Service set forth in Section 2 (Intercom Services) and the applicable SOW, but Intercom will retain all right, title and interest in and to any such work product, code or deliverables and any derivative, enhancement or modification thereof created by Intercom (or its agents).</p>13.\nLimitation of Remedies and Damages<p>13.1.&nbsp;<strong>Consequential Damages Waiver.&nbsp;</strong>EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.</p>\n<p>13.2.&nbsp;<strong>Liability Cap.&nbsp;</strong>INTERCOM'S AND ITS SUPPLIERS' ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER TO INTERCOM DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>13.3.&nbsp;<strong>Excluded Claims.&nbsp;</strong>\"<strong>Excluded Claims</strong>\" means any claim arising (a) from Customer's breach of Section 2.7 (General Restrictions).\n(b) under Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations) or 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer).\nor (c) from a party's breach of its obligations in Section 15 (Confidential Information) (but excluding claims arising from operation or non-operation of any Service).</p>\n<p>13.4.&nbsp;<strong>Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose</strong>.\nThe parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 13 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contact, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>14.\nIndemnification<p>Intercom will defend Customer from and against any claim by a third party alleging that a Service when used as authorized under this Agreement infringes a U.S.\npatent, U.S.\ncopyright, or U.S.\ntrademark and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages and costs finally awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by Intercom (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from such claim, provided that Intercom will have received from Customer: (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Intercom to respond without prejudice).\n(ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim.\nand (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer.\nIf Customer's use of a Service is (or in Intercom's opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if Intercom determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, Intercom may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services.\n(b) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Service.\nor if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer the fees paid by Customer for the portion of the Subscription Term that was paid by Customer but not rendered by Intercom.\nThe foregoing indemnification obligation of Intercom will not apply: (1) if such Service is modified by any party other than Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification.\n(2) if such Service is combined with products or processes not provided by Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination.\n(3) to any unauthorized use of such Service.\n(4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Data or any third-party deliverables or components contained within such Service.\n(5) to the extent the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular technology or implementation of the Service but instead by features common to any similar product or service.\nor (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without Intercom's prior written consent.\nTHIS SECTION 14 SETS FORTH Intercom's AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.</p>15.\nConfidential Information<p>Each party (as \"<strong>Receiving Party</strong>\") agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (\"<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>\") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (\"<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny Intercom Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Intercom without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Intercom, the subcontractors referenced in Section 17.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 15 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>16.\nCo-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release (\"<strong>Press Release</strong>\") on a mutually agreed upon date or the 90th day from the Effective Date, whichever is earlier.\nEach party will have the right to approve the Press Release in advance, but such approval will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\nCustomer also agrees to participate in other reasonable marketing activities that promote the benefits of the Services to other potential customers and to use of Customer's name and logo on Intercom's web site and in Intercom promotional materials.\nCustomer agrees that Intercom may disclose Customer as a customer of Intercom.</p>17.\nGeneral Terms<p>17.1.&nbsp;<strong>Assignment</strong>&nbsp;.\nThis Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns.\nNeither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party's assets or voting securities.\nAny attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 17.1 will be null and void.</p>\n<p>17.2.&nbsp;<strong>Severability</strong>.\nIf any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.</p>\n<p>17.3.&nbsp;<strong>Governing Law.\nDispute Resolution</strong>.</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;Direct Dispute Resolution.\nIn the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to this Agreement, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, (\"<strong>Dispute</strong>\"), the parties shall first use their best efforts to resolve the Dispute.\nIf a Dispute arises, the complaining party shall provide written notice to the other party in a document specifically entitled \"Initial Notice of Dispute,\" specifically setting forth the precise nature of the dispute (\"<strong>Initial Notice of Dispute</strong>\").\nIf an Initial Notice of Dispute is being sent to Intercom it must be emailed to legal@intercom.io and sent via mail to:</p>\n<p>Attn: Legal Department Intercom 55 Second Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94105</p>\n<p>Following receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interest, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution of the Dispute that is satisfactory to both parties (\"<strong>Direct Dispute Resolution</strong>\").\nIf the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the Dispute through Direct Dispute Resolution within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Initial Notice of Dispute, then the Dispute shall subsequently be resolved by arbitration as set forth below.</p>\n<p>b)&nbsp;Arbitration.\nIN THE EVENT THAT A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE PARTIES CANNOT BE SETTLED THROUGH DIRECT DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO SUBMIT THE DISPUTE TO BINDING ARBITRATION.\nBY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted before a single neutral arbitrator, before JAMS in San Francisco, California.\nThe arbitration shall be administered by JAMS in accordance with this document and the JAMS Streamlined Rules and Procedures for the Arbitration, with one addition: The limitation of one discovery deposition per side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted.\nThe arbitrator shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing.\nAny issue concerning the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, the applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of this agreement shall be resolved by the arbitrator.\nTo the extent state law is applicable, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of California.</p>\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential and neither the parties nor the arbitrators may disclose the content or results of the arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.\nThe result of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration.</p>\n<p>c)&nbsp;Choice of Law and Jurisdiction.\nFOR ANY CLAIM WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, CUSTOMER AGREES TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.\nIN ANY DISPUTE, CALIFORNIA LAW SHALL APPLY.</p>\n<p>d)&nbsp;Construction and Joinder.\nTHIS AGREEMENT MUST BE CONSTRUED AS IF IT WAS JOINTLY WRITTEN BY BOTH PARTIES.\nBOTH CUSTOMER AND INTERCOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN THEIR RESPECTIVE INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS.\nNO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.\nIN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.</p>\n<p>e)&nbsp;Injunctive Relief.\nNotwithstanding the above provisions, Intercom may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>17.4.&nbsp;<strong>Notice</strong>.\nAny notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing to the parties at the addresses set forth on the Order Form or at such other address as may be given in writing by either party to the other in accordance with this Section and will be deemed to have been received by the addressee (i) if given by hand, immediately upon receipt.\n(ii) if given by overnight courier service, the first business day following dispatch or (iii) if given by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, the second business day after such notice is deposited in the mail.</p>\n<p>17.5.&nbsp;<strong>Amendments.\nWaivers</strong>.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, no supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement will be binding, unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement.\nNo waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.\nNo provision of any purchase order or other business form employed by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect.</p>\n<p>17.6.&nbsp;<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>.\nThis Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\nCustomer acknowledges that the Services are on-line, subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved customer experience Intercom may make changes to the Services, and Intercom will update the applicable Documentation accordingly.\nThe support and service level availability terms described in the Support Policy and the SLA may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Intercom's obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).</p>\n<p>17.7.&nbsp;<strong>Force Majeure</strong>.\nNeither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of this Agreement and that are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency.</p>\n<p>17.8.&nbsp;<strong>Subcontractors</strong>&nbsp;.\nIntercom may use the services of subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Intercom in order to provide the Services under this Agreement, provided that Intercom remains responsible for (i) compliance of any such subcontractor with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) for the overall performance of the Services as required under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>17.9.&nbsp;<strong>Subpoenas</strong>.\nNothing in this Agreement prevents Intercom from disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Intercom will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer where permitted to do so.</p>\n<p>17.10.&nbsp;<strong>Independent Contractors</strong>.\nThe parties to this Agreement are independent contractors.\nThere is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties.\nNeither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party's behalf without the other party's prior written consent</p>\n<p>17.11.&nbsp;<strong>Export Control</strong>.\nIn its use of the Services, Customer agrees to comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the United States and other applicable jurisdictions.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, (i) Customer represents and warrants that it is not listed on any U.S.\ngovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties or located in (or a national of) a country that is subject to a U.S.\ngovernment embargo or that has been designated by the U.S.\ngovernment as a \"terrorist supporting\" country, (ii) Customer will not (and will not permit any of its users to) access or use the Services in violation of any U.S.\nexport embargo, prohibition or restriction, and (iii) Customer will not submit to the Services any information that is controlled under the U.S.\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations</p>\n<p>17.12.&nbsp;<strong>Government End-Users</strong>.\nElements of the Services are commercial computer software.\nIf the user or licensee of the Services is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Services, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by a license agreement or by the terms of this Agreement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes.\nAll Services were developed fully at private expense.\nAll other use is prohibited</p>\n<p>17.13.&nbsp;<strong>Counterparts.</strong>&nbsp;This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original and all of which together will be considered one and the same agreement.</p>Sitemap<ul>\n<li>Pricing</li>\n<li>Use Cases<ul>\n<li>Conversational Marketing</li>\n<li>Conversational Engagement</li>\n<li>Conversational

specifications or related information (\"<strong>SOW</strong>\").\nUnless Professional Services are provided on a fixed-fee basis, Customer will pay Intercom at the per-hour rates set forth in the Order Form (or, if not specified, at Intercom's then-standard rates) for any excess services.\nCustomer will reimburse Intercom for reasonable travel and lodging expenses as incurred.\nCustomer may

NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.</p>\n<p>13.2.&nbsp;<strong>Liability Cap.&nbsp;</strong>INTERCOM'S AND ITS SUPPLIERS' ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER TO INTERCOM DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>13.3.&nbsp;<strong>Excluded Claims.&nbsp;</strong>\"<strong>Excluded Claims</strong>\" means any claim arising (a) from Customer's breach of Section 2.7 (General Restrictions).\n(b) under Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations) or 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer).\nor (c) from a party's breach of its obligations in Section 15 (Confidential Information) (but excluding claims arising from operation or non-operation of any Service).</p>\n<p>13.4.&nbsp;<strong>Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose</strong>.\nThe parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 13 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contact, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>14.\nIndemnification<p>Intercom will defend Customer from and against any claim by a third party alleging that a Service when used as authorized under this Agreement infringes a U.S.\npatent, U.S.\ncopyright, or U.S.\ntrademark and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages and costs finally awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by Intercom (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from such claim, provided that Intercom will have received from Customer: (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Intercom to respond without prejudice).\n(ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim.\nand (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer.\nIf Customer's use of a Service is (or in Intercom's opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if Intercom determines such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, Intercom may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute substantially functionally similar products or services.\n(b) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Service.\nor if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer the fees paid by Customer for the portion of the Subscription Term that was paid by Customer but not rendered by Intercom.\nThe foregoing indemnification obligation of Intercom will not apply: (1) if such Service is modified by any party other than Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification.\n(2) if such Service is combined with products or processes not provided by Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination.\n(3) to any unauthorized use of such Service.\n(4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Data or any third-party deliverables or components contained within such Service.\n(5) to the extent the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular technology or implementation of the Service but instead by features common to any similar product or service.\nor (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without Intercom's prior written consent.\nTHIS SECTION 14 SETS FORTH Intercom's AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.</p>15.\nConfidential Information<p>Each party (as \"<strong>Receiving Party</strong>\") agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (\"<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>\") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (\"<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny Intercom Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Intercom without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Intercom, the subcontractors referenced in Section 17.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 15 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>16.\nCo-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release (\"<strong>Press Release</strong>\") on a mutually agreed upon date or the 90th day from the Effective Date, whichever is earlier.\nEach party will have the right to approve the Press Release in advance, but such approval will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.\nCustomer also agrees to participate in other reasonable marketing activities that promote the benefits of the Services to other potential customers and to use of Customer's name and logo on Intercom's web site and in Intercom promotional materials.\nCustomer agrees that Intercom may disclose Customer as a customer of Intercom.</p>17.\nGeneral

without the advance written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party's assets or voting securities.\nAny attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 17.1 will be null and void.</p>\n<p>17.2.&nbsp;<strong>Severability</strong>.\nIf any provision of this Agreement will be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.</p>\n<p>17.3.&nbsp;<strong>Governing Law.\nDispute Resolution</strong>.</p>\n<p>a)&nbsp;Direct

and equitable solution of the Dispute that is satisfactory to both parties (\"<strong>Direct Dispute Resolution</strong>\").\nIf the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the Dispute through

limitation of one discovery deposition per side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted.\nThe arbitrator shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing.\nAny issue concerning the extent to which any dispute is subject to arbitration, the applicability, interpretation, or enforceability of this agreement shall be resolved by the arbitrator.\nTo the extent state law is applicable, the arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of California.</p>\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration shall be treated as confidential and neither the parties nor the arbitrators may disclose the content or results of the arbitration, except as necessary to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.\nThe result of the arbitration shall be binding on the parties and judgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator shall award to the prevailing party, if any, the costs and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with the arbitration.</p>\n<p>c)&nbsp;Choice of Law and Jurisdiction.\nFOR ANY CLAIM WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, CUSTOMER AGREES TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED WITHIN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.\nIN ANY DISPUTE, CALIFORNIA LAW SHALL

ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SERVICES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.\nIN THE EVENT OF ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.</p>\n<p>e)&nbsp;Injunctive Relief.\nNotwithstanding the above provisions, Intercom may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>17.4.&nbsp;<strong>Notice</strong>.\nAny notice or communication required or permitted under this Agreement will be in writing to the parties at the addresses set forth on the Order Form or at such other address as may be given in writing by either

nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.\nNo provision of any purchase order or other business form employed by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect.</p>\n<p>17.6.&nbsp;<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>.\nThis Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.\nCustomer acknowledges that the Services are on-line, subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved customer experience Intercom may make changes to the Services, and Intercom will update the applicable Documentation accordingly.\nThe support and service level availability terms described in the Support Policy and the SLA may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Intercom's obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).</p>\n<p>17.7.&nbsp;<strong>Force Majeure</strong>.\nNeither party will be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of

telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency.</p>\n<p>17.8.&nbsp;<strong>Subcontractors</strong>&nbsp;.\nIntercom may use the services of

such subcontractor with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) for the overall performance of the Services as required under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>17.9.&nbsp;<strong>Subpoenas</strong>.\nNothing in this Agreement prevents Intercom from disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Intercom will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer where

it might have at law.</p>16.\nCo-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release (\"<strong>Press Release</strong>\") on a mutually agreed upon date or

other Intercom Confidential Information in its possession.\nProvided this Agreement was not terminated for Customer's breach, Customer may retain and use internally copies of all reports exported from any Service prior to termination.\nCustomer acknowledges that following termination it will have no further access to any Customer Data input into any Service, and that Intercom may delete any such data as may have been stored by Intercom at any time.\nExcept where an exclusive remedy is specified, the exercise of either party of any remedy under this Agreement, including termination, will be

a third party alleging that a Service when used as authorized under this Agreement infringes a U.S.\npatent, U.S.\ncopyright, or U.S.\ntrademark and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages and costs finally awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by Intercom (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from such claim, provided that Intercom will have

the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim.\nand (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer.\nIf Customer's use of a Service is (or in Intercom's opinion is

substantially functionally similar products or services.\n(b) procure for Customer the right to continue using such Service.\nor if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c) terminate this Agreement and refund to Customer the fees paid by Customer for the portion of the Subscription Term that was paid by Customer but not rendered by Intercom.\nThe foregoing indemnification obligation of Intercom will not apply: (1) if such Service is modified by any party other than Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification.\n(2) if such Service is combined with products or processes not provided by Intercom, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination.\n(3) to any unauthorized use of such Service.\n(4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Data or any third-party deliverables or components contained within such Service.\n(5) to the extent the alleged infringement is not caused by the particular technology or implementation of the Service but instead by features common to any similar product or service.\nor (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without Intercom's prior written consent.\nTHIS SECTION 14 SETS FORTH Intercom's AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

obtains from the disclosing party (\"<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>\") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (\"<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny Intercom Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of Intercom without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Intercom, the subcontractors referenced in Section 17.8 (Subcontractors)), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 15 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 15.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>16.\nCo-Marketing<p>At the request of Intercom, Customer agrees to the issuance of a joint press release (\"<strong>Press Release</strong>\") on a mutually agreed upon date or

limitation of one discovery deposition per side shall be applied by the arbitrator, unless it is determined, based on all relevant circumstances, that more depositions are warranted.\nThe arbitrator shall consider the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will occur in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose to appear by person, by phone, by another virtual means, or through the submission of documents.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will issue a ruling in writing.\nAny issue concerning the extent to which

ANY DISPUTE CONCERNING THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION, SUCH CLAIM MUST BE ADJUDICATED BY A COURT AND NOT BY AN ARBITRATOR.</p>\n<p>e)&nbsp;Injunctive Relief.\nNotwithstanding the

form employed by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement will be for administrative purposes only and will have no legal effect.</p>\n<p>17.6.&nbsp;<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>.\nThis Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous

the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of
