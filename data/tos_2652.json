to pay for a purchase with your stored-value card, on certain campuses, (i) Grubhub will charge such purchase to your stored-value card and will charge any applicable fees to either your credit card or other payment on file with us, and (ii) you agree that Grubhub may be unable to refund a purchase to your stored-value card and may, in its discretion, provide a refund through an alternative

(e.g.\ndata brokers or other data resellers).Does Grubhub actually \u201csell\u201d my personal information? As explained above, we do not \u201csell\u201d your information in the traditional sense of the word.\nInstead, we use it to connect you with restaurants partners where you have previously placed orders so that they can communicate directly with you and share exclusive offers with you.\nThe data-sharing relationship we have with this limited set of restaurant partners are considered \u201csales\u201d under the law.What happens if I opt out of data sales?<p>If you opt out, Grubhub will stop disclosing your personal information to our restaurant partners, and you will miss out on deals and offers those restaurant partners might otherwise communicate to you.\nIf you place an order with that restaurant partner, we will share your personal information as needed for operational purposes only, such as completing your order.\nOnce you opt out of data sales, you will be unable to opt back in.</p>\n<p>\n</p>What part of my experience doesn't change?<p>Opting out of data sales

texts, or change communications preferences in your account settings.\n</p>Previous data sales<p>If we previously disclosed your personal information to a third party before receiving your opt-out request, that third party may continue to use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies.\nFor example, if we shared your information with one of our restaurant partners and they added you to their restaurant email distribution list, you will continue to receive those emails unless or until you unsubscribe from that restaurant partner.</p>Other disclosures for
