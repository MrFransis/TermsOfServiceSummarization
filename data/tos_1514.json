and costs, arising, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, out of your violation of any law or the rights of any person.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BINDING ARBITRATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Site or Mobile App or use of the Site or Mobile App or these Terms, other than claims relating to infringement of copyright or other intellectual property, may only be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the Paragraph or alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\n&nbsp;The arbitration must be held in a location determined by the arbitrator as set forth herein (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, in accordance with the applicable procedural rules set forth in the then prevailing Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (\u201cJAMS Rules and Procedures\u201d), and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n&nbsp;The JAMS Rules and Procedures are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling (800) 352-5267.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator must be selected pursuant to the JAMS Rules and Procedures.\n&nbsp;The arbitrator shall apply Missouri law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.&nbsp.\nIf you initiate arbitrations against National, you will not be responsible for professional fees for the arbitrator\u2019s services or any other JAMS fees.&nbsp.\nIf you are able to demonstrated that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive or greater than the costs of litigation, National will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive or more expensive than the cost of litigation.&nbsp.\nIf any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal (other than that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis), or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures established by JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision remains in effect and must be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\n&nbsp;If, however, the portion that is deemed invalid, unenforceable or illegal is that claims will not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, then the entirety of this arbitration provision is null and void, and neither you nor National is entitled to arbitrate their dispute.&nbsp.\n<strong>THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PURSUANT TO THIS PARAGRAPH MUST BE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\n&nbsp;THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BY AGREEING TO THE ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES AS SET FORTH HEREIN, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>DISPUTES</strong>\n<br>\nThese Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law principles.\nAny action to enforce these Terms of Use regarding a claim not subject to binding arbitration must be brought in the federal court in the Eastern District of Missouri or the state courts located in St.\nLouis County, Missouri.\nBy using the Site or Mobile App, you consent to the jurisdiction and venue of these courts.\nExcept where prohibited, you agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action directly or indirectly arising out of the Site or Mobile App must be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action.&nbsp.\nThis limitation does not apply to residents of New Jersey.\nAny claim or cause of action you may have with respect to the Site or Mobile App must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises, regardless of any law to the contrary.&nbsp.\nThis limitation does not apply to residents of New Jersey.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GENERAL</strong>\n<br>\nIf any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision must be construed consistent with applicable law, and the remaining provisions must be enforced.\nHeadings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope of such section.\nOur failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other provision.\nThese Terms of Use set forth the entire agreement between you and National in connection with your use of the Site or Mobile App.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Entypo pictograms by Daniel Bruce \u2014 www.entypo.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CONTACT US</strong>\n<br>\nIf you have any questions
