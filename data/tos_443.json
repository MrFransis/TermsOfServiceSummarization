Cookie Policy (<strong>\u201cPolicy\u201d</strong>) provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies and other types of similar technologies, what they do and your choices regarding their use.\nAs described in our Privacy Policy, we use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who visits Kongregate.com and/or Kartridge.com (each a <strong>\u201cSite,\u201d</strong> and together, the <strong>\u201cSites\u201d</strong>) has a good experience.\nThis Cookie Policy (which is incorporated into the Privacy Policy), our Privacy Policy and our User Agreement (of which the Privacy Policy is a part) applies when you visit our Sites, using the Apps, playing 3rd Party Platform Games or otherwise access any of our other products, services or content through any of our Platform or through 3rd Party Platform Games (collectively, <strong>\u201cServices\u201d</strong>) that link to this Policy or incorporates it by reference.\nBy continuing to use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes we describe in this Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</strong> Cookies are small pieces of data (text files) that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer, phone, tablet, or other device used to browse our Sites.\nCookies can be set by us on our own Sites (which are called <strong>\u201cfirst-party cookies\u201d</strong>) or they can also be set by third parties other than Kongregate (which are called <strong>\u201cthird-party cookies\u201d</strong>).\nCookies allow us to identify and authenticate visitors, track aggregate behavior, and enable important site features.\nThird-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics) to be provided on or through the Sites.\nThe parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when you visit the website in question and also when you visit certain other websites.</p>\n<p>There are two types of cookies \u2013 more permanent \u201cpersistent\u201d cookies and temporary \u201csession\u201d cookies.\nWe use both types of cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Persistent cookies</em>\n</strong> are used in a number of ways, including to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintain your login information and remain available when you return to the Sites and are stored as a file on your computer or mobile device for a longer period of time.</li>\n<li>Allow you to move between pages on our Sites without having to re-enter information and to move between our Sites, Apps and/or our Platforms, known as \u201csingle sign-on.\u201d</li>\n<li>Help us recognize you when you return to our Sites to use our services.</li>\n<li>Allow you access to stored information.</li>\n<li>Allow us to recommend other games or online content that suit your preferences.</li>\n<li>Ensure that you do not get asked to fill in the survey form repeatedly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Session cookies</em>\n</strong> are used in a number of way, including, to maintain your gaming state as you browse through the Site and are temporarily placed on your computer when you visit our Sites, but are erased when you shut down the page.\nWe may use session cookies to allow you to move between pages on our Site without having to re-enter information.</p>\n<p>We (and our authorized third parties) may use non-personal information from both persistent and session cookies for the following statistical purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To determine which are the most popular parts of our Sites.</li>\n<li>To monitor the use of our services and our Sites (frequency and time).</li>\n<li>To provide anonymous information to third parties so that more appropriate advertising can be directed at you.</li>\n<li>To track product success.</li>\n<li>To determine how frequently you and other users visit our Sites and purchases.</li>\n<li>To carry out surveys so that your interaction with our Sites and us can improve.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>WHAT ARE THE CATEGORIES OF COOKIES WE USE AND WHY DO WE USE THEM?</strong> We use the information from cookies to make our Sites user-friendly and to enable us to provide you with personalized recommendations and improve the user experience when you visit our Sites.\nBelow are the categories of cookies and similar technologies we use:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Essential Cookies.</em>\n</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary for us to provide our Services.\nWe use these essential cookies to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Authenticate and identify you as being logged in when they visit our Sites so we can provide our Services.</li>\n<li>Help us to enforce our User Agreement and maintain the security of our services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Without these cookies, we would not be able to recognize you and you would not be able to access our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Performance and Functionality Cookies.</em>\n</strong> These cookies are not strictly necessary, but allow us to personalize your online experience of our Sites.\nWe use these performance and functionality cookies to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember which information you\u2019ve already entered so you do not have to provide them again, e.g., when signing-up to our services.</li>\n<li>Remember Site preferences and customize Site content.</li>\n<li>Collect information (e.g., popular pages, viewing patterns, click-throughs) about our visitors' usage of our Services to conduct market research and carry out web analytics.</li>\n<li>Measure the effectiveness of our advertising and provide feedback to affiliates when one of our user also visits their sites.</li>\n<li>Help us improve our Sites and Services and measure errors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you choose to delete these cookies you will have limited functionality of our Services.\nSome of our performance and functionality cookies are managed for us by third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Flash Cookies/LSOs.</em>\n</strong> Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use flash cookies or Local Shared Objects (\u201cLSOs\u201d), to collect and store information.\nWe use these flash cookies to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify devices so we can prevent and respond to fraud or other illegal activity.</li>\n<li>Store game preferences so we can present the game experience you want.</li>\n<li>Store game assets (files) on your device so you can have faster load times.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing LSOs.\nIf you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your device, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the \u201cWebsite Storage Settings Panel.\u201d You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the \u201cGlobal Storage Settings Panel.\u201d</p>\n<p>Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with Kongregate\u2019s services or online content.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and Clear Gifs.</em>\n</strong> We automatically collect aggregate anonymous information through web beacons, pixel tags and clear gifs, which are terms for similar technology.\nThese small strings of (software) code track events such as when a user visits a page or opens an email and allow advertising networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.\nThese web beacons, pixel tags and clear gifs help measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns, deliver more relevant content, and manage advertising for Kongregate\u2019s games.\nThey also provide additional functionality to the Platform and help us analyze usage of our Sites more accurately.\nIn many instances, beacons, pixel tags, and clear gifs work in conjunction with cookies to function properly, so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>\n<p>To learn more about how behavioral advertising works and your ability to opt out, visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NIA), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), or Your Online Choices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Targeted Advertising Cookies.</em>\n</strong> Kongregate works with third-party publishers and advertising networks to deliver interest-based ads to users that have visited Kongregate Platforms, played Kongregate\u2019s Apps or otherwise accessed Kongregate\u2019s Services.\nThis practice is often referred to as \u201conline behavioral advertising\u201d or \u201ctargeted advertising.\u201d Our authorized advertising partners use software that recognizes pixels and cookies (identifiers) that are placed on the browsers of users.\nThese cookies use information about your usage of our Sites and other Services, e.g., the pages you visit or your response to ads, to deliver ads that are more tailored to you, both on and off our Sites.\nWhen the ad software recognizes these identifiers, they deliver ads for Kongregate\u2019s Services to Kongregate users who are on other websites.\nThe number and names of third party cookies, pixels and other technologies change, these tables may be updated from time to time.\nThese third party cookies are governed by the respective sites and are not controlled by us.</p>\n<p>For more information about and to opt out of interest based ads from many ad networks, go to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>European Union: www.youronlinechoices.eu/ </li>\n<li>Canada: www.youradchoices.ca </li>\n<li>U.S.: www.aboutads.info/choices/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads.\nIf you would like more information about third party advertisers please click here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Targeted Advertising IDs for Mobile Apps.</em>\n</strong> There are no cookies in mobile apps.\nWhen you play our mobile games, we or our third party advertising partners may use one or more of several different identifiers for your mobile device, including Apple Identifier For Advertising (IDFA) or Android Advertising ID (AAID), to target and deliver ads to you in our games or on other apps.\nThis means that your device identifier may be accessed by third-party ad networks and used to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>help manage the number and types of ads you see;</li>\n<li>track the source of installs related to ads seen in other apps.\nand</li>\n<li>identify your interests and behavior and target advertising to you based on those interests and behavior.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do not want to receive interest-based in-application advertisements on your mobile device, you may adjust the ad tracking settings on your device (such as turning on \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d).\nYou can also reset the \u201cAdvertising Identifier\u201d (such as an IDFA) from your mobile device\u2019s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to your previous \u201cAdvertising Identifier.\u201d Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s \u201cAppChoices\u201d app, that offer to provide you with controls regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for behavioral advertising.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Analytics.</em>\n</strong> Kongregate analyzes traffic and other end user activity to improve the user experience.\nKongregate and its service providers and business partners may use web server log files and tracking technologies to collect and analyze certain types of technical information, such as cookies, IP addresses, device type, and usage information, including time spent on particular pages or number of clicks.\nThese cookies help us to understand the effectiveness of our websites, services, and/or marketing campaigns.\nOur analytics partners use browser cookies to generate statistics about visitors to websites, such as the number of page views or times of peak traffic.\nOur third party analytics partners include, without limitation, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjust: https://www.adjust.com/privacy-policy/.\nhttps://www.adjust.com/opt-out/ </li>\n<li>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php

cookies by declining to accept cookies or managing cookies in your web browser.\nIf you want to find out how to do this visit aboutcookies.org.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that changes in your web

may share information we collect with our third party business partners, advertising companies, and other third parties or allow third parties to collect this information for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may use third party service providers to perform services for us such as to provide the infrastructure and IT services

perform other statistical analyzes.\nIn the performance of these services, the third party vendors may have access to your personal data but is only authorized to process it strictly on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Advertisers.</strong> We have advertising on our Services so we can offer continue to offer many of our Services for free.\nOur advertising partners may have access to our personal data but you may opt-out as described in <strong>\u201cYour Rights and Options\u201d</strong> below and the Cookie Policy.\nWe may also use aggregate information to monitor usage of our Services in order to help us improve and develop our Services, and we may provide such aggregate information to third parties, e.g., content partners or advertisers.\nThis aggregate information does not include personal data and cannot be linked to you.\nWhen advertisers or ad networks place ads in our Services, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our Services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);</li>\n<li>Aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (like players between the ages of 21 and 25 who live San Francisco);</li>\n<li>Certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as IDFAs, and de-identified persistent device identifiers such as a hashed Android ID);</li>\n<li>Your social network ID;</li>\n<li>And other contextual data about your game play (for example, your level and session length).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The information collected may be used to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Measure how effective ads are, to offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as behavioral advertising), and/or</li>\n<li>Undertake web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics which is used to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve your experience).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons.\nAfter clicking on a third party advertisement, you may no longer be on our Platform.\nThe third party sites are operated by companies that are outside of our control, and your activities at those sites will be governed by the policies and practices of those third parties.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy practices of these third parties before disclosing any personally identifiable information, as we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Offer Walls.</strong> Our Services may display an \u201coffer wall\u201d that is hosted by an offer wall provider.\nThe offer wall allows third-party advertisers to provide virtual currency to players in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers.\nAfter clicking on one of these offers, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Kongregate or the social network through which you are playing Kongregate games.\nTo properly credit player accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your Kongregate user name/ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>3rd Party Platform Games.</strong> If you play 3rd Party Platform Games through platforms or sites operated by a third party, including social media sites such as Facebook, your social media \u201cfriends,\u201d other players, or other types of connections may, depending on your social media privacy settings, be able to: see certain personal information about you.\nview your game activity.\nand/or communicate with you or send you \u201cfriend\u201d or other connection requests through the social media service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>3rd Party Developers.</strong> Most of the games on our Platforms are created by 3rd party developers.\nThese 3rd party developers may request, by using Kongregate\u2019s SDK and APIs, certain publicly visible information about users that play their games, e.g., your username, your user_id (a numeric ID associated with your account that persists even if a username is changed), list of your Kongregate friends (usernames and user_ids).\nIf you wish to reduce the availability or visibility of such information, you may change your profile settings to \u201cPrivate\u201d in your account options.\nThis will prevent others, including 3rd party developers, from being able to see or access your friends list as well as other information you have shared on your profile page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Parties for Security or Other Legitimate Reasons.</strong> We may also disclose your personal data to third parties, if we reasonably believe that disclosure of such personal data is necessary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To comply with valid legal

administrative purposes or the provision of our Services to you.\nIf you have agreed thereto, we may also disclose your personal data to affiliate companies owned or operated by our parent company for marketing purposes.\nThe affiliate companies who may have access to your personal data follow practices consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Corporate Transaction, Reorganization or Bankruptcy.</strong> In the event of a change of control, sale of some or all of our business or assets, corporate reorganization or bankruptcy, we would share the pertinent customer information (which may include your personal information) with the other business entity (or entities) involved in the transaction.\nIn such an event, we would notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Platform of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Compliance.</strong> We may disclose information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required by law to do so.\nWe may also share information with companies assisting in fraud protection, legal compliance or investigations.\nWe do not provide information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.</p>\n<p>With respect to onward transfers, we remain liable should the third parties to whom we transfer personal data process such information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disclosure under California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d).</strong> We do not rent or sell personal information collected by or from any Service or portion of a Service that is directed to Children

phone number, or postal address, but we may share identifiers such as cookies and the advertising identifier associated with your mobile device with our advertising partners, and those partners may use and share those identifiers to show ads that are targeted to your interests.\nIf this takes place, these disclosures may constitute a \u201csale\u201d under California law.\n</p>\n<p>In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold any personal information, but we have disclosed the following categories of personal information for a business purpose:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Category A:</strong> Identifiers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Category B:</strong> California Customer Records personal information categories.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Category

this Privacy Policy.\nWe do periodic status checks to review when personal data needs to be deleted.\nHowever, as we process your personal data for various purposes, the actual period for which the personal data will be stored will depend on the circumstances.\nFor example, we may retain some information for a few years after you have closed your account with us if this is necessary to meet our legal obligations or to exercise, defend or establish legal rights.\nWhen we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we will either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we cannot identify you.</p>\n<p>While we endeavor to honor your requests related to your personal data, we may not be fully able\nto honor the request until a later time or we may deny your deletion request if retaining the\ninformation is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or\nservice that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our\nongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;</li>\n<li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or\nprosecute those responsible for such activities;</li>\n<li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;</li>\n<li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights,\nor exercise another right provided for by law;</li>\n<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.\nPenal Code \u00a7 1546 et.\nseq.);</li>\n<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public\ninterest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information\u2019s\ndeletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research\u2019s achievement, if you\npreviously provided informed consent;</li>\n<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on\nyour relationship with us;</li>\n<li>Comply with a legal obligation.\nand/or</li>\n<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context\nin which you provided it.</li>\n</ul> 5.\nHow We Protect Your Information <p>We strive to maintain the security of your personal information through a variety of security measures.\nSafeguarding your personal data is a priority for us.\nPersonal data that you provide to us is stored on secure servers, and we use rigorous procedures to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data.\nAlthough we work hard to protect your personal data, please note that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.\nTherefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal data, and we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information.</p>\n<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to any login or password information, and to your computer or device.\nTo minimize the risk of having your account being compromised, we recommend that you set up your account password using unique numbers, letters and special characters.\nDo not disclose passwords to others.\nPlease notify us of any password compromises and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection.\nTo learn more about how to protect yourself online, we encourage you to visit the government\u2019s website at www.onguardonline.gov</p> 6.\nOur Policies Concerning Children <p>\n<strong>Our Services are Not Designed for Children.</strong> Our Services, Platform and 3rd Party Platform Games are generally designed for and directed at people 18 years of age or older.\nNo one under the age of 13 within the United States (or up to the age of 16 for children located in certain European countries)(collectively, <strong>\u201cChildren\u201d</strong>) may provide any personal information to us, and we do not knowingly collect information from Children except in connection with the following Apps which Kongregate has designated as directed to Children (collectively, our \u201c<strong>Kid-Appealing Games</strong>\u201c).</p>\n<p>For our limited collection of Kid-Appealing Games, we recognize a special obligation to further protect personal information collected from Children.\nWe urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses or phone numbers without permission.\nSome of the features of our Kid-Appealing Games are age-gated so that they are not available for use by Children.\nWhen we intend to collect personal information from Children, we take additional steps to protect children\u2019s privacy, including:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Notifying&nbsp.\nparents &nbsp;about our information practices with regard to Children, including the types of personal information we may collect from Children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In accordance with applicable law, and our practices, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their children, or for sending information about our Services directed to Children;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Limiting our collection of personal information from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their Children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>For additional information about our practices regarding Children\u2019s personal information, please read our&nbsp;<strong>Children\u2019s Privacy Policy</strong>.</p>\n<p>With the exception of a handful or so of our Kid-Appealing Games, Children should not attempt to create an account or send any of your information to us, including your name, address, telephone number or email address.\nIf Kongregate learns that we have collected personal information from Children without verification of parental consent in contravention of these measures, we will terminate access to the account immediately and will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or other as required or allowed by law).\nIf you believe that we might have any information from or about Children, please contact us at 1-800-678-2319 or at support@kongregate.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to Remove Posted Information \u2014 California Minors.</strong> If you are under 18 years of age,

receive a different price or rate for goods or services\nor a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>\n<p>Please contact us at 1-800-678-2319 or at support@kongregate.com to make a request in respect of your rights.\nWe will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to your request within 30 days of receiving such request.\nIf we cannot honor your request within the 30-day period, we will let you know the reasons why and when we expect to be able to fulfil your request.</p>\n<p>If our processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time (this will however not affect the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal) by contacting us at 1-800-678-2319 or support@kongregate.com or by updating

policy, issues with the Platform or compromised data access).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Opting Out of App Notifications.</strong> Kongregate Apps may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide game information, news, updates, or other relevant information.\nYou can manage these updates from the \u201csettings\u201d page from within the App or from your device control panel that manages these notifications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Opting Out of Social Media Platform.</strong> If you wish to edit or manage the information Kongregate receives from a social media platform, you need to follow the applicable instructions at the specific social media site.\nFor example, Facebook\u2019s relevant policy in this regard can be found here.\nPlease note that once Kongregate receives any personal information from a social media site as a result of a user playing 3rd Party Platform Games, it will be stored and handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Opting Out of Geolocation.</strong> In order to improve and optimize our service continuously, we use mobile tracking technologies.\nWith the help of these services, we collect data on the usage of our Apps to be able to constantly improve our Services.\nIn this respect, we may collect: IP address, which is anonymized right away, MAC address, anonymized Device ID (IDentifier For Advertisers (IDFA)) or Google Advertiser ID (GAID), browser type, language settings, internet service provider, network status, time zone, URL of the entry and exit pages, date of access and time spent, clickstream data, and other statistical information about the use of our Services.\nIf you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data, you can stop

tap on the \u201cAd\u201d button.\nWhen the Ad window has opened, you can deactivate the Google Advertising ID.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Opting Out of Third Party Tailored Advertising.</strong> If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored web and mobile web advertising you may visit the following websites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your Online Choices UK website for EU-based advertising.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on your mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device.\nYou can also reset the \u201cAdvertising Identifier\u201d (like an IDFA) from your mobile device\u2019s \u201csettings\u201d page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous \u201cAdvertising Identifier.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s \u201cAppChoices\u201d app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for tailored advertising.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads.\nWhile you do have choices to limit personalized ads that are tailored to your interests, you may receive generic ads.\nThese opt-out tools are not provided by Kongregate but provided by third parties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Opting Out of Analytics.</strong> We use internal and third party analytics tools, including Google Analytics.\nThe third party analytics companies we work with may collect and store data related to our website, enabling the creation of user profiles under pseudonyms.\nThese user profiles serve to analyze visitor behavior and are

further information about our compliance with this law or have questions or concerns about our privacy practices may contact us at support@Kongregate.com or by writing to the address provided under <strong>\u201cQuestions, Concerns or Requests\u201d</strong> below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Do Not Track is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings.\nAt this time, there is no general agreement on how companies such as ours should interpret Do Not Track signals.\nKongregate does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device.\nYou can learn more about Do Not Track here.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> 8.\nTransfer Out of Europe On the Basis of
