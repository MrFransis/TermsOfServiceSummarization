access and use of all products and services owned and offered by Tresorit, including applications, websites and technologies or functions and relating Software (the \"Services\").\nYou may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, the Tresorit Privacy Policy and the Data Processing Addendum (if applicable).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Resellers:</strong> As a Customer, you may purchase a subscription directly from a third party (\"Reseller\").\nIn such cases, in addition to this Agreement, separate terms and conditions with the Reseller may apply to your access to the Service.\nYou expressly acknowledge and agree that Tresorit is entitled to enforce this Agreement against you and that Resellers are not authorized to make any promises or commitments on Tresorit's behalf.\nTresorit is not bound by any obligations other than what is specified in the documents listed above in clause 1.1.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes in Service:</strong> We are always looking for ways to make the Services better, smarter, and more secure.\nTo live up to that, we may need to modify features and functionality from time to time.\nIf we change the Services during the term of this Agreement in a manner that materially reduces functionality or limit access to certain features, we will notify Customers at the email address associated with their account.\nAfter receiving the notice, as a Customer, you may terminate this Agreement within thirty days.\nIn such case, you will be provided with a pro-rata refund of any pre-payment.\nThis termination right will not apply to updates made to features provided as Beta Services.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Confidentiality of Encrypted Content</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Encryption:</strong> You acknowledge that by using the Service, the files uploaded and/or shared through the Service (\"Customer Files\") are encrypted by client-side encryption before they leave the User's location (\"Encrypted Content\").\nAccording to the best of Tresorit's knowledge and the current state of the art, Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by Tresorit or any unauthorized third party.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Collaboration:</strong> When you upload and/or share Customer Files through the Service, Encrypted Content can only be decrypted by you by accessing your account and by persons with whom Encrypted Content is specifically shared with (\"Collaborator\").\nIf you are a Company Administered User, or the relevant Collaborator is a Company Administered User, in certain cases your Administrator or the Administrator of your Collaborator may also have cryptographic access to the shared Encrypted Content in accordance with section 5 (Business Administrator) below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Roles and permissions:</strong> You understand that Encrypted Content will be accessible by Collaborators to the extent the relevant Collaborators have been granted access.\nYour and Collaborators' rights are defined in accordance with your \"permission\" that defines whether you can modify, delete or reshare the Encrypted Content.\nBefore sharing Encrypted Content, please consider the permissions of the relevant Collaborator.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Password:</strong> Tresorit has no access to passwords and there is no way for Tresorit to recover passwords relating to your account.\nTresorit is not liable if Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted due to password loss.\nIt is strongly recommended that Users keep backups of any content on their own systems.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Customer Files</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Limited Permission:</strong> This Agreement does not grant Tresorit any ownership over the contents of Customer Files or over Customer's intellectual property, except for the limited rights that are reasonably necessary for Tresorit to provide the Services in accordance with this Agreement, in particular to store, backup or transfer (as set out in clause 4.3) Customer Files and Service Data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Content:</strong> You understand that Tresorit uses strong cryptography algorithms to protect Customer Files and as a Customer, you are fully and solely responsible and accountable for the content of Customer Files.\nBy using the Services, you guarantee that you have all required permissions for each Customer File \u2013 including copyright and other intellectual property rights \u2013 to distribute, transfer, store and/or make the content available online through the Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Company Administered Users:</strong> As a Company Administered User or Administrator, you acknowledge that Customer Files are owned by Customer and this Agreement provides Customer with many choices and control over Customer Files uploaded and/or shared within the Services, as set out in section 5 (Business Administrator).\nIn addition, depending on the relevant Collaborator's rights, Collaborators may be able to modify, delete or reshare the Encrypted Content.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data processing and transfer</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal Data:</strong> In order to operate and provide the Services, Tresorit collects certain non-encrypted information (\"Service Data\") that may include Personal Data.\nFurther information about how Tresorit collects, uses and discloses Personal Data is set out in Tresorit's Privacy Policy and the Data Processing Agreement (if applicable).\nCustomer acknowledges that, due to client-side encryption, Encrypted Content is not deemed to be Personal Data from the perspective of Tresorit, as Tresorit cannot use encrypted information to identify any individual.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Sub-processors:</strong> Customer agrees that in providing the Services, Tresorit will engage entities within the Tresorit group and authorized service providers, to process Encrypted Content and Service Data (\"Sub-processors\"), including and without limitation, any associated Personal Data under this Agreement within the EEA, the United States and in other countries and territories.\nThe list of Sub-processors is available at: https://tresorit.com/used-trusted-third-parties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data transfers:</strong> Customer agrees that Tresorit and its Sub-processors may transfer Encrypted Content and Service Data between their servers, to the devices of Users and/or Collaborators, and as a result, Users and Collaborators may have access to Customer Files in locations other than Customer's country.\nTresorit may provide the ability for Customer to select a major geographic area for data storage purposes.\nIn such case, Tresorit will store Customer Files within that area chosen by Customer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Processing on behalf Customer:</strong> If Customer has an account for business purposes (\"Business Subscription\"), by entering into this Agreement Customer instructs Tresorit to process Personal Data on its behalf and to provide the Services in accordance with Tresorit features and functionalities or as further documented by mutually-agreed upon written instructions given by Customer and accepted by Tresorit.\nCustomer acknowledges that its Company Administered Users' use of the Services is subject to Tresorit's Privacy Policy and understand that it identifies how Tresorit collects, stores, and uses certain information.\nCustomer will make Company Administered Users familiar with the Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Processing Agreement:</strong> If Customer has a Business Subscription and is subject to EU Data Protection Laws, Customer agrees to the Data Processing Addendum (available through the Tresorit application).\nCustomer cannot process any information via the Services that falls within the definition of \"Protected Health Information\" under the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 C.F.R.\nSection 164.051) unless Customer and Tresorit have entered into a separate HIPAA Business Associate Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Administrators</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Administrator rights:</strong> In the case of certain Service Plans, Customer may appoint selected Company Administered User(s) as \"Administrator(s)\" and may change this role at any time.\nAdministrators may have the ability to monitor, restrict or terminate access to accounts relating to Customer's subscription (\"Company Administered User Accounts\").\nIn addition, Administrators may be entitled to request different or additional services (including setting up policies and two-step verification for Customer accounts), assist in third-party product integrations, and accept notices, disclosures, and terms and conditions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Advanced control:</strong> Customer may set up advanced control in his own Business Subscription.\nUpon the consent of Company Administered Users to advanced control, a designated Administrator will gain cryptographic access to their Encrypted Content (\"Recovery Administrator\").\nIn such case, Tresorit will continue to store Customer Files in accordance with clause 2.1 above, i.e.\nEncrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by Tresorit or any unauthorized third party.\nHowever, the designated Recovery Administrator will have access to the recovery key and might also reset Company Administered Users' passwords and may be able to access, disclose, restrict or remove information in or from Company Administered User Accounts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Joining a Business Subscription:</strong> As a Customer, you may convert your private account into a Company Administered User Account by joining a Business Subscription.\nIn that case, all data stored with Tresorit (including Encrypted Content and Service Data) will also be transferred into the Business Subscription.\nBe careful to join the right organization's Business Subscription because after joining the Business Subscription, you may not able to convert it back without deleting all data stored within the Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Email:</strong> If the primary email address of Customer's account is owned by an organization and was assigned to Customer as an employee, contractor or member of the organization, the Administrator may require that Customer joins the relevant Business Subscription and to convert his private account.\nIn this case, Customer may not be able to use the Service without accepting the terms of that Business Subscription and without joining that Business Subscription.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Managed Services:</strong> If Customer purchases the Services via a Reseller, Customer may appoint any of the Reseller's personnel as Administrators of Customer's account.\nIn this case, Customer Files are stored in accordance with clause 2.1 above, i.e.\nEncrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by Tresorit or any unauthorized third party, but Customer acknowledges that, the Reseller may be able to control and have access to account information, including Customer Files and Service Data.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Customer responsibility</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Eligibility to use:</strong> You represent and warrant that: (i) you are of legal age (18 years of age or older or otherwise of legal age in your resident jurisdiction) and competent to agree to this Agreement and (ii) you have validly entered into this agreement and have the legal power to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Compliance:</strong> As between the parties, Customer is responsible for compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Acceptable Use Policy, including for any and all activities that occur under Company Administered User Accounts.\nCustomer is solely responsible for compliance with laws and regulations applicable to Customer's and Company Administered User's use of the Services.\nCustomer maintains all responsibility for determining whether the Services are accurate or sufficient for its purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Customer Administration of the Services:</strong> Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of passwords and Customer accounts.\nCustomer, and not Tresorit, is responsible for the internal management or administration of the Service.\nThe Services support logins using two-step authentication.\nIf a two-step verification method is switched on for Customer's account(s), Tresorit will not let access to the relevant accounts without two-step verification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Customer Passwords:</strong> Customer understands and accepts that if Customer's or a Company Administered User's password is lost, he cannot get access to his account.\nTo prevent the loss of files, Customer will maintain, protect, update, secure and backup his computer and his locally stored and synchronized Customer Files.\nCustomer acknowledges that Tresorit does not offer back-up services but rather a cloud storage sync and share service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Embargoed Countries:</strong> The Software includes cryptographic software that may be subject to import or export controls or other restrictions under the laws of the country in which Customer intends to use the Services.\nIt is Customer's sole obligation and responsibility to check such limitations before using the Services and to comply with such restrictions and limitations.</p>\n<p>Customer shall not access or use the Services if Customer located in any jurisdiction in which the provision of the Services, Software or other components is prohibited under the laws of Switzerland, the United States or the European Union or other applicable laws or regulations (a \"Prohibited Jurisdiction\") and Customer shall not provide access to the Services to any government, entity or individual located in any Prohibited Jurisdiction.\nCustomer represents and warrants that (i) Customer is not prohibited from receiving Swiss, EU or US exports.\n(ii) Customer is not a national of, or a company registered in, any Prohibited Jurisdiction.\n(iii) Customer shall not permit Users to access or use the Services in violation of any U.S.\nor other applicable export embargoes, prohibitions or restrictions.\nand (iv) Customer shall comply with all applicable export laws regarding the transmission of technical data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Security of devices:</strong> Without prejudice to clause 3.2 above, parts of encryption keys may be stored on Customer's and its Users' device (memory or persistent storage), or Tresorit may provide you a printable recovery encryption key.\nEven in cases where such encryption key is provided to Customer, Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by Tresorit or any unauthorized third party.\nCustomer is responsible for devices relating to its Business Subscription and any copy of printed or otherwise archived recovery keys.\nTresorit cannot be held liable if Customer's device is stolen or hacked and an unauthorized person gets access to Encrypted Data by accessing a locally stored copy, or by obtaining un-protected passwords or any encryption keys stored on the relevant device.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Internet connection:</strong> You understand that certain functions of the Services require Internet connection.\nYou are responsible for procuring and maintaining the network connections that connect your network to the Services, including, but not limited to, \"browser\" software that supports protocols used by Tresorit.\nYou are responsible for obtaining and maintaining all connectivity, computer software, hardware and other equipment needed for access to and use of the Services.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-party requests</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Customer Responsibility:</strong> Because of client-side encryption specified in clause 2.1, Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by Tresorit or any unauthorized third party.\nAccordingly, Customer is responsible for responding to any request from a third-party relating to Customers', including Company Administered Users', use of the Services (\"Third-party Request\"), including Customer Files and Service Data, via its own access to information.\nCustomer will seek to obtain information required to respond to Third-party Requests and will contact Tresorit only if it cannot obtain such information despite diligent efforts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Tresorit Responsibility:</strong> If Tresorit receives a Third-party Request relating to Customer, then \u2013 to the extent allowed by law and by the terms of the Third-party Request \u2013 Tresorit will make commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) notify Customer promptly of Tresorit's receipt of a Third-party Request.\n(ii) comply with Customer's commercially reasonable requests regarding its efforts to oppose a Third-party Request.\nand (iii) provide Customer with information or tools required for Customer to respond to the Third-party Request, if Customer is otherwise unable to respond to the Third-party Request.</p>\n<p>If Customer fails to respond promptly to any Third-party Request, Tresorit may, but will not be obligated to do so.\nIn particular, Tresorit may provide Service Data in response to a Third-party Request, respecting all limitations in clause 2.1, if Tresorit has a reason to believe that it is required: (i) to comply with any law or order issued by any legal authority.\n(ii) to avoid infringement of the rights of a third party.\n(iii) to protect the property of Tresorit or the personal safety of our users and the public.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Fees</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Plan:</strong> Tresorit offers both free and paid Services.\nIf Customer subscribes to a paid Service directly through the subscription flow of Tresorit, then prices and features of Services depend on the Service Plan selected as well as any changes instigated by Customer.\nTresorit's current prices and features are published on Tresorit's website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Fees, currency:</strong> Customer will pay Tresorit or the relevant Reseller all applicable fees (\"Fees\") for the Services, in the currency quoted at the time of purchase.\nCustomer authorises Tresorit, to charge Customer for all applicable Fees using Customer's selected payment method.\n<strong>Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement.</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Licenses:</strong> Subject to any limitation on the number of individual user accounts available under the applicable Service Plan(s) to which Customer subscribed, access to and use of the Services is restricted to the specified number of individual Company Administered Users permitted under Customer's subscription.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Subscription Period:</strong> When subscribing to a paid service, Customer may elect the term of its Service Plan (\"Subscription Period\").\nIf Customer selects a monthly Service Plan, Customer can switch to an annual Service Plan at any time.\nIf Customer selects an annual Service Plan, Customer may not change to a monthly Service Plan until the end of the one-year term of Customer's Service Plan.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Billing:</strong> Customer must provide current, complete, accurate and authorized payment method information (e.g.\ncredit card information).\nTresorit may bill: (i) in advance.\n(ii) at the time of purchase.\n(iii) shortly after purchase.\nor (iv) on a recurring basis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Auto-renewal:</strong> Fees will automatically be charged monthly or annually, for each month, partial month or year, depending upon the billing period selected by Customer for the subscription.\n<strong>Customer agrees that its subscription is automatically renewed for the same period at the end of each billing period</strong> (but for no longer than a year), <strong>and Tresorit may charge automatically at the end of the trial or the renewal, unless Customer notifies Tresorit in advance that Customer wants to cancel.</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Downgrade and cancellation:</strong> No refunds or credits for Fees or payments will be provided to Customer if Customer elects to downgrade or cancel its Service Plan.\nPlease consider the relevant changes carefully as downgrading the Service Plan may cause loss of content, features, or capacity of the Service, and Tresorit does not accept any liability for such loss.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes:</strong> Tresorit uses reasonable commercial efforts to implement changes of the Service Plan or features instigated by Customer as soon as possible.\nIf Customer decides to downgrade or cancel, changes will take effect the day after the last day of the then current Subscription Period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Joining the subscription of others:</strong> If your account as a Customer is added to the subscription of another Tresorit customer, then all previous subscriptions under your account may be immediately cancelled and removed.\nAs a Customer, you understand and acknowledge that if you join the subscription of another Tresorit Customer, you become dependent from this customer and take the risk that Tresorit may suspend the Service for reasons caused by this customer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Taxes:</strong> Fees are exclusive of taxes and Customer is responsible for all taxes.\nTresorit will invoice Customer for such taxes if Tresorit believes that it has a legal obligation to do so and Customer agrees to pay such taxes if so invoiced.\nIf Customer is exempt from paying any taxes, Customer must provide Tresorit with a valid exemption certificate for all relevant jurisdictions, and Tresorit will not collect the taxes covered by the relevant certificate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes of fees:</strong> In cases where Tresorit offered a specific duration and Fee for use of the Service, the Fee will remain in force for the relevant Subscription Period.\nHowever, Tresorit does not represent or warrant that a particular Service Plan will be offered indefinitely and reserves the right to change the prices for or alter the features and options in a particular Service Plan.\nTresorit may revise the relevant Fees by providing Customers at least thirty days' notice.\nSubject to applicable law, Customer's use of the Service will be charged at the then-current Fee(s) after the relevant period ends, unless Customer cancels the subscription at the end of his current subscription period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Purchase from Reseller:</strong> If you as a Customer purchase from a Reseller, then the scope of the Services and the specifics of your payment obligations are stated in your agreement with the Reseller.\nIn such case, you owe payment to the Reseller as agreed between you and the Reseller, but you acknowledge that Customer's rights to use the Services may be suspended or terminated if Tresorit does not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Promotions and free services</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Promotions:</strong> Customer may
