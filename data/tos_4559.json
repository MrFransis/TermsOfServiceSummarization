domain name registrar and marketplace), as well as other products and services as identified within our Epik Labs page.\n</p>\n<p> Like most online companies, Epik collects personal information from customers, which we use to provide reliable service.\nThis Privacy Policy explains what kinds of personal information (Info) we collect, the purposes for which it is used, and how it may be shared.\nWe also explain your rights to review this personal information and to modify or withdraw your consent for Epik to use or share it.\n</p> What Info is Collected <p>(1) Account Creation</p>\n<p>When you create an Epik account, we collect the following information from you:</p>\n<p>\n-\tFirst and Last Name<br>\n-\tEmail Address<br>\n-\tPostal Address<br>\n-\tPhone Number<br>\n</p>\n<p>(2) Security</p>\n<p>\nAdditionally, Epik asks new customers to select or create the following:\n</p>\n<p>\n-\tUser Name<br>\n-\tPassword<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n(3) Payments\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen processing payments by you to Epik or disbursing funds from Epik to you, we naturally collect information about the payment method used:\n</p>\n<p>\n-\tCredit / Debit Card<br>\n-\tAliPay<br>\n-\tBitcoin<br>\n-\tBank Account (for Wire Transfers)<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n(4) Additional Authorization\n</p>\n<p>\nIn rare cases, Epik may request further information on a strictly voluntary basis:\n</p>\n<p>\n-\tCitizenship information<br>\n-\tScanned copies of government-issued ID<br>\n-\tVAT Number<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n(5) Support Inquiries\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you contact Epik customer support, our system will log pertinent information, which may include:\n</p>\n<p>\n-\tFist and Last Name<br>\n-\tEmail Address<br>\n-\tAccount PIN Number<br>\n-\tMessage text<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n(6) Domain Inquiries\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen someone inquires about a domain name that is registered at Epik, that person may be addressing the owner, or Epik, or (due to confusion) someone else.\nSuch communications pass through Epik's system, and we keep a record:\n</p>\n<p>\n-\tFirst and Last Name<br>\n-\tPhone Number<br>\n-\tEmail Address <br>\n-\tOffer Amount (if any)<br>\n-\tMessage Text<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n(7) Online Interactions\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you visit the Epik platform \u2013 including any of our websites, apps, or support channels \u2013 or interact with an email message sent by us, Epik may log pertinent data:\n</p>\n<p>\n-\tIP Address<br>\n-\tOnline Actions (pages viewed, links clicked, settings altered)<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nNote: Epik does not track your online behavior except as it relates to the Epik platform.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you believe some personal information gathered by Epik has been omitted from the list above, please notify us so that we can add a clear explanation.\nOur goal is complete transparency.\n</p> How Information is Used <p>\nThis description mirrors the numbering used in the previous section.\n</p>\n<p>\n(1) Account Creation\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen registering a domain name, ownership and contact details are required by ICANN and other TLD registry operators.\nThese include first and last name, mailing address, phone number, and email address.\nSuch details are used to identify the domain name's legal owner as well as to contact the administrator in the event of alleged abuse.\nEpik cannot process domain registrations without this basic information.\n</p>\n<p>\nAlthough some TLDs (domain endings) require additional kinds of information beyond those data cited, for most TLDs these are sufficient.\nTo minimize intrusiveness, Epik gathers only what we need for the most common TLDs.\nThis core information is requested at the moment of account creation because, as a domain registrar, Epik anticipates that most customers will register or transfer a domain soon after creating an account.\nFor a streamlined experience, our goal is to have customers fill out only one form.\n</p>\n<p>\nAdditionally, Epik relies on these details \u2013 especially name, email address, and phone number \u2013 to identify customers correctly when they contact Epik support.\nIn cases where Epik must contact you about a problem, we rely on both email and phone, since either method alone may fail.\nCollecting your phone number also allows Epik to offer 2-factor authentication as an additional security option \u2013 safer than password protection alone.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs a global company, we also refer to state and country information to choose the right time of day to call.\nIn rare cases, legal notices must be delivered by physical post to the address on file.\nMailing address information is also used to assess eligibility for certain TLD registrations, which are sometimes limited to particular countries or even cities.\nThis helps Epik show relevant TLDs to you via email or on our website.\nWith more than 1000 TLDs in existence, we can improve the user experience by focusing on those with a connection to you based on language or location.\nEpik also uses geographical information to perform a statistical analysis of our customer base.\n</p>\n<p>\nEpik sends automated renewal reminders via email to help customers avoid unintentional service interruptions, additional fees, or total loss of a domain name once it expires.\nEmail is also used to notify customers of important issues such as policy changes, outages, security breaches, price increases, and so forth.\nMarketing emails may also be sent to customers who have opted to receive information about promotional prices, new Epik features, new TLDs, new services, domain industry news, and the like.\nNotably, domain transfers between Epik accounts or between Epik and another domain registrar cannot function properly without email notifications.\nThat is true of all domain registrars.\nYour email address is also used to validate account ownership and to restore access in the event that a password is forgotten.\n</p>\n<p>\n(2) Security\n</p>\n<p>\nYour password is used to provide secure account access at Epik.\nYour user name is used to identify accounts in contexts where you don't wish to share your personal name or email address.\nFor example, when moving a domain from someone else's account to yours, you may not wish to divulge personally identifying information.\nAs a pseudonym tied to your account, the user name can be a useful substitute.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe refer to your account PIN # in the event that a password is forgotten and you cannot reset it through email.\nFor customers who have lost email access but who can contact Epik by phone, chat or an alternative email address not on file, this is often a life saver.\nFor those who have misplaced their PIN # or did not take note of it while logged into their account, will be able to submit requested information such as a valid ID and selfie through our account with Validation.com.\nA link will be supplied to go to in order to submit the requested information for review.\n</p>\n<p>\n(3) Payments\n</p>\n<p>\nWe gather payment details only for the limited purpose of processing payments from you to Epik or from Epik to you.\nBank information is only recorded when processing wire transfers between Epik and customers who choose to pay or be paid in this way.\nDetails are recorded for auditing purposes, in order to match Epik's registrar transactions with bank account records.\n</p>\n<p>\nFull credit / debit card details are never stored by Epik's system during or after checkout.\nWe simply transmit them to Epik's payment processor and also to a contracted fraud detection service.\nHeavily redacted representations of the credit card number do exist on the Epik system, showing only a few digits.\nThese are used to differentiate between payment methods when researching transaction history.\nThe redacted versions are also displayed to you inside your Epik account so that you can identify 1 card among many.\nSending your credit card details to Epik by email or over the phone is highly discouraged.\n</p>\n<p>\nEpik may store your credit / debit card's expiration date.\nWe use this information to alert you when a card on file is about to expire.\nThis is important to avoid payment failures associated with auto-renewal, monthly hosting, or monthly domain Rental / Purchase plans.\nSince the consequences of missed payments can be severe and stressful, Epik hopes to prevent headaches for its customers by warning them in advance.\nThis also minimizes the number of renewal reminders we would otherwise send to customers.\nThat means less email clutter.\n</p>\n<p>\n(4) Additional Authorization\n</p>\n<p>\nSome TLD registries require additional information before a domain name can be registered.\nFor example, to use .CN or even .COM inside China, the Chinese government requires a scanned copy of government-issued ID.\nLikewise, Australia requires an ABN (Australian Business Number) or even a trademark number in order to process .AU registrations.\nEpik does not collect this information from you unless we need it to process a domain registration that you have ordered.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn rare cases, Epik must investigate suspicious activity, including credit card theft.\nOr you may find yourself completely locked out of your Epik account, if you have lost email access and cannot remember any of your security credentials.\nUnder those unusual circumstances, Epik may ask some customers to voluntarily submit a copy of government-issued ID in order to prove their identity.\nThis is strictly voluntary, and it is meant to protect customers and non-customers from fraud.\u2028 Some European customers volunteer their VAT number for purposes of invoicing.\n</p>\n<p>\n(5) Support Inquiries\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the context of support tickets, Epik relies on your first and last name, email address, and account PIN number in several ways: to validate your identity, locate your account quickly, search for your ticket within our system, and reply to you.\nThis information is preserved indefinitely along with the messages themselves.\nWe use it to train support staff, document abuse allegations, identify and fix glitches, and research customer history in order to help you in the future.\n</p>\n<p>\n(6) Domain Inquiries\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen someone has questions about a domain name, wishes to buy it, or wishes to complain about trademark infringement, they will often attempt to contact Epik or the domain owner.\nThis can occur at various points on the Epik platform, including our whois lookup portal (whois.epik.com), via Epik support channels, through a parked domain page, or through a listing created by you in the Epik marketplace.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen the person is attempting to contact the domain owner, we pass their details and message along to that owner.\nAt the same time, Epik maintains an internal copy of the information.\nThis includes all pertinent information: first and last name, phone number, email address, offer amount (if applicable), and message text.\nStoring a backup copy allows Epik to forward the message to the domain owner when the first email delivery failed for some reason.\nEpik may also use this data to build an internal messaging system, which allows customers to track their domain inquiries more efficiently.\nEpik also analyzes this data to measure and improve marketplace performance for the benefit of our customers.\nAlso, if the person who contacted a domain owner later chooses to request help from Epik, then Epik may refer to the relevant messages.\n</p>\n<p>\n(7) Online Interactions\n</p>\n<p>\nEpik uses data related to your IP address to make our website more relevant.\nFor example, we may try to show the local currency or language.\nYour IP address is also a factor in assessing the risk of credit card fraud, since stolen cards are often used by criminals in remote overseas locations.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike most websites, Epik tracks page views and links clicked in order to measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns and website interface.\nThis automatic feedback is crucial for online companies to improve the user experience \u2013 making it easier for customers to find what they're looking for, eliminating unused features that clutter a website, delivering more relevant messages, and minimizing the number of unwanted emails we deliver.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe also use page views in Epik's support channel so that our agents can know, in real time, which page you are viewing (and which is perhaps giving you difficulty).\nMost importantly, Epik tracks changes made by the user inside their Epik account in order to troubleshoot errors, reverse accidental changes, and defeat hackers.\n</p>\n<p>\nEpik uses \"cookies\", which are small files transferred to your browser.\nCookies allow us to provide a seamless user experience.\nFor example, they let you stay logged in.\nThey also help us display the appropriate language and currency for you.\nEpik may use cookies to track the way customers move throughout the website and interact with ad campaigns or email messages.\nThis helps us improve the website layout.\nCookies are also used to process coupon codes, which save you money.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you believe Epik is using your personal information in some way not described above, please contact us.\nOur goal is complete transparency.\nIf anything has been left out, that omission is accidental and will be corrected promptly once you let us know.\n</p> What Info is Shared <p>\nEpik will only share your information with third parties as described in this document, or as authorized by you, or when doing so is truly necessary.\nIn the last case, Epik will notify you promptly.\n</p>\n<p>\nRegistering a domain name causes your contact information to be instantly listed in the public whois database.\nSpecifically, your first and last name, email address, phone number, and mailing address will appear on a variety of whois lookup portals.\nThis ICANN requirement governs all domain registrars, not just Epik.\nOver the years, many third parties have scraped the public whois data, packaged, and resold it.\nEpik is not responsible for this unavoidable consequence of ICANN's longstanding policy, nor are most other registrars.\n</p>\n<p>\nEpik has always offered a whois privacy service called \"Anonymize\", which masks your identity and contact details in whois, preserving your anonymity while allowing email messages to be forwarded through an intermediary address.\nWhereas most registrars charge $10 - $20 per year per domain for similar whois privacy services, Anonymize at Epik has always been completely free of charge.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll customers can turn on Anonymize privacy for some or all of their Epik domains at any time.\nAlthough a few TLDs are incompatible with such privacy, most do permit it.\nPrior to May 25, 2018, Anonymize was offered as an opt-in service \u2013 meaning you had to click to turn it on.\nNow that the European General Data Protection Regulation is in effect, Anonymize will be enabled by default for all EU citizens.\nThis has been applied retroactively for prior registrations as of May 25, 2018, though domains belonging non-EU citizens retain their pre-existing Anonymize settings, whether on or off.\nIf you are an EU citizen and wish your whois contact information to be displayed without masking, then you can opt into such transparency at Epik.\nAll domains newly arriving in Epik accounts after May 25, 2018, will have Anonymize enabled by default.\nIf you're a non-EU citizen, that applies to you too.\nbut you can always turn privacy OFF for some or all of your domains.\n</p>\n<p>\nEpik may also be required to share these whois contact details with the registry that governs a particular TLD (domain ending).\nPolicies in this regard differ.\nThere are over 1000 TLDs, which imply numerous registries whose products (TLDs) are sold by registrars like Epik.\nWhen you register a domain name, you should assume that these details will be shared by Epik with the registry operator in question.\nThis is based on the registrar-registry agreement Epik has signed with them, which is how we offer the TLD to you as a customer.\nRegistries rarely act as registrars themselves.\nSo it is normally necessary to register a domain through a registrar which, in turn, shares the data with a registry.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn some cases, Epik is a reseller, offering some TLD through another company, which is itself the registrar.\nThis means Epik is 2 degrees removed from the registry.\nThis practice is common for obscure country code TLDs, which may have complicated registration requirements.\nIn these instances, Epik offers front-line customer support, relying on an upstream provider's local country credentials.\nThis allows you to do business with Epik, consolidating your various TLDs with 1 company, rather than creating multiple accounts elsewhere.\nThat means more efficiency and less scattered personal information.\nIn order to function in this way, Epik must supply your whois contact details to the upstream registrar, which, in turn, supplies them to the TLD registry.\n</p>\n<p>\nEpik is also required by ICANN to store backup information with a data escrow company such as Iron Mountain Digital.\nThis protects you, as a customer, in the unlikely event that a registrar ceases operations.\nRelying on this securely stored data, another company could reconstruct transactions and continue seamless operation.\u2028\u2028When you purchase any product or service at Epik, we submit your billing information to the payment processor.\nPrior to doing so, we may submit such data to a fraud detection service, whose software scans the transaction and assesses the likelihood that a credit card is stolen.\nNearly all e-commerce websites do likewise.\nIt is safer to transmit this data to a reputable company that specializes in payment processing than it would be to store that data at Epik.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy purchasing an SSL certificate, you consent that all information provided as part of that certificate will be published online.\nIn fact, that is the basis for SSL certificates.\nA third party must inspect that data in order for that certificate to be validated.\u2028\u2028Epik is a reseller of SSL certificates.\nAs such, we share your information with the company that prepares the SSL for you.\nLikewise, if you purchase a trademark application through Epik, we will share your information with a contractor who processes the application.\n</p>\n<p>\nEpik may share your login credentials as a \"Single Sign-On\" among the platforms controlled by us: Epik.com, MasterBucks.com, and Anonymize.com.\nThis minimizes the collection of personal information and improves the user experience, since it allows you to log in to any or all platforms using common information.\nAll of these platforms are maintained by Epik and share a common support staff.\nSo the data is only \"shared\" in a nominal sense \u2013 from our left hand into our right hand.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome domain names are listed for sale in Epik search results, though they may not be registered at Epik at the time.\nThis occurs because Epik is part of a network of registrars and marketplaces that cross-list such inventory.\nIn fact, Epik belongs to more than 1 such network.\nCross-listing in this way helps you find more good domain name options wherever you may be searching.\nIf you purchase a domain name that is listed at Epik in this way, then Epik may need to share some of your information with the company responsible for the domain listing.\nWe only share the bare minimum required to deliver the domain to you once you have purchased it.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn general, Epik seeks to protect whistle blowers, who report misuse of domain names such as phishing.\nAs a general rule, we attempt to investigate and resolve the matter without dislcosing the identity or contact information of the person who lodged the complaint.\nHowever, in some cases, Epik may choose to share your identity and contact information with the customer against whom you've complained.\nThis may be done in order for all parties to resolve the matter more efficiently.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you post comments on a public forum or blog managed by Epik, then any personal details you publish there can be read or compiled by persons, companies, or bots.\nThe same applies to content you publish through website templates or website building programs that you may purchase through us.\nEpik cannot prevent such external actors from repurposing your messages and personal details nor from sending you unsolicited messages if you choose to expose your personal details in a way that allows them to do so.\nEpik will never obligate you to publish comments in public.\nNor will Epik require you to disclose your identity or contact information merely to post a comment in public, assuming you wish to do so.\n</p>\n<p>\nOf course, when Epik is legally obligated to share your personal details with a third party, then we must do so.\nThis might occur due to a UDRP proceeding, as stipulated by ICANN.\nSimilar mechanisms for resolving trademark disputes exist for various ccTLD registries.\nDivulging your private details may also be required in order to comply with a court order in civil litigation or to assist law enforcement.\nWhenever Epik is forced to divulge your personal information, we will make an effort to notify you promptly regarding what personal details have been shared, with whom, and why.\n</p> Your Rights <p>\nAt any time, you can request to know what personal information related to you \u2013 if any \u2013 Epik has stored or processed.\nFor questions, please contact support@epik.com.\nPlease note that we will require you to prove your identity before divulging private information.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll customers can modify their preferences regarding email notifications.\nEpik gives you granular control over which emails you receive \u2013 and how frequently we send them.\nSettings can be found and modified within your Epik account at any time.\nThough, of course, we do include an \"unsubscribe\" link in the email itself, we recommend modifying your permissions within the account.\nClicking \"unsubscribe\" can cause other kinds of email notifications to be blocked \u2013 not just those that resemble the message in question.\nSome notifications, such as renewal reminders, can be crucial.\nIf a domain expires, you may lose ownership of it completely.\nFor your own sake, please consider carefully which emails you wish to discontinue altogether.\nOr if you wish to avoid receiving all email, then perhaps consider setting your domains to auto-renew first, while ensuring that your card on file will not itself be expiring.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are an EU citizen, then beginning May 25, 2018, you have detailed privacy rights governed by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nSpecifically, you have the right to:\n</p>\n<p>\n(1) Access (GDPR 15)<br>\n(2) Rectification (GDRP 16)<br>\n(3) Erasure (GDPR 17)<br>\n(4) Restriction (GDPR 18)<br>\n(5) Portability (GDPR 20)<br>\n(6) Objection (GDPR 21)<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information, consult the GDPR regulation itself, referring to the article numbers cited above.\nIf you believe Epik is not complying with the GDPR in some respect, please let us know.\nWe will make every effort to abide by this new law.\n</p> Quick Links\n<p>Manage My Domains</p>\n<p>Register New Domains</p>\n<p>Pre-Order The New
