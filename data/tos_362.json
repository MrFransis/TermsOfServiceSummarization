notifying you on the Site or by sending you an email.\nNew versions of this Policy will never apply retroactively\u2014we\u2019ll tell you the exact date they go into effect.\nIf you keep using Kickstarter after a change, that means you accept this Policy.</p>\nWho We Are\n<p>Kickstarter, PBC (together with Drip U.S., LLC, The Creative Independent, LLC, and its and their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, consultants, employees, officers, and directors\u2014collectively, \u201cKickstarter,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) provides services that help people bring creative projects to life (our \"Services\").\nOur main service is a funding platform for creative projects.\nWe are a Public Benefit Corporation based in Brooklyn, NY.</p>\nHow This Policy Applies\n<p>This Policy describes the information we collect from you, how we use that information and our legal basis for doing so.\nIt also covers whether and how that information may be shared and your rights and choices regarding the information you provide to us.\nIf you see a capitalized word, it\u2019s defined in our Terms of Use.\nWe use cookies and similar technologies, as described in our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>By using the Services offered by Kickstarter, you\u2019re acknowledging you have agreed to our Terms of Use and that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy.</p>\nWhat We Collect and Receive\n<p>In order for you to create an account on Kickstarter and use our Services, we need to collect and process certain information.\nDepending on your use of the Services, that may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information you provide by completing forms on Kickstarter \u2014 your name, email and postal addresses, telephone number, country of residence, login, and password details.\nWe may ask for this information if you register as a user of the Services, subscribe to our newsletters, upload or submit content through Kickstarter, or if you contact us;</li>\n<li>Information you provide for identity verification purposes when launching a project, including your legal name, business name and Tax ID for business entities, and date of birth.\nIn some cases, our payment processor will request that you provide a secure upload of an identity document (such as your passport, drivers license or other government-issued ID) to Kickstarter;</li>\n<li>Details of any requests or transactions you make through the Services.\nKickstarter partners with other companies (such as Stripe) for payment processing, and the payment information you submit is collected and used by them in accordance with their privacy policies (read Stripe's privacy policy).\nKickstarter doesn\u2019t store your payment information apart from the last four digits of your credit card or bank account (as applicable), expiration date, and country, which we require for tax, government regulatory, and security purposes;</li>\n<li>Information about your activity on and interaction with Kickstarter, including use of our mobile apps (such as your IP address, the type of device or browser you use, and your actions on the Site);</li>\n<li>Information about the ways people visit and interact with our Site, in the form of traffic analytics.\nYou can opt out of being included in Google Analytics.\nFor more information about our use of data analytics to protect and improve our Services, see our Cookie Policy;</li>\n<li>Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);</li>\n<li>Information that you submit on or to Kickstarter in the form of comments, contributions to discussions, or messages to other users.\nand</li>\n<li>The email address associated with your Facebook account, if you choose to sign up using your Facebook credentials.\nKickstarter will also request permission to access your name, profile picture, and friend list (these permissions are governed by Facebook\u2019s privacy policies and can be managed through your Facebook privacy settings).\nWe never post anything to your Facebook, Twitter, or other third-party accounts without your permission.</li>\n<li>Demographic information\u2014such as your age, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, and ethnicity\u2014that you have the option to provide to us after giving your consent to the processing of those personal data in order to help Kickstarter equitably support all creators and represent a diverse population in our research.\nThis category includes data that may qualify as protected classifications under other California, federal, or other applicable laws.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may decline to provide us with your information.\nHowever, this will limit your ability to register for an account or use our Services.\nYou may pledge to a project as a guest by providing only an email address.\nHowever, to adjust your pledge, save payment details for future pledges, make project comments and take most other actions on our Site, you will need to finish creating an account.\nYou may review, change or remove your information through your account settings.</p>\nHow We Use This Information\n<p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To keep your account secure and protect our Services (including to verify the identities of creators and prevent fraud and abuse);</li>\n<li>To enable us to provide you with our Services, and to improve and promote our Services;</li>\n<li>To create and administer your account, contact you, and customize your experience on Kickstarter (for example, to show you projects that we think may interest you based on your previous use).\nand</li>\n<li>To track and analyze use of the Services so that we can improve how Kickstarter is performing and provide users with the best experience possible.</li>\n</ul>\nEuropean Union Users\n<p>Data protection law in Europe requires a \u201clawful basis\u201d for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area.\nOur lawful bases include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Performing the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services, enable creators to establish and display their projects, and enable backers to find and make pledges to them.</li>\n<li>Legal compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data.\nFor example, tax laws require us to retain records of pledges and payments made through our Services.</li>\n<li>\nLegitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights.\nWe sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the Services secure.\nWe may also send you promotional communications about our Services, subject to your right to control whether we do so.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe analyze how users interact with our Site so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well.\nThis allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\nHow This Information Is Shared\n<b>Information that\u2019s shared publicly</b>\n<p>When you create an account, we create a basic profile page for you on Kickstarter, containing your username, the date the account was created, and a list of projects you have backed or launched.\nBy default, your profile is private and you can choose to make it public in your account settings.\nYour username appears with the comments you post and messages you send on Kickstarter and, if your profile is set to public, people can click your username to view it.\nIf you make your profile public, others will be able to see the following things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The account username you select, and the date the account was created;</li>\n<li>Any information you choose to add to your profile (like a picture, bio, or your location);</li>\n<li>Projects you\u2019ve backed (but not pledge amounts or rewards chosen);</li>\n<li>Projects you\u2019ve created;</li>\n<li>Comments you\u2019ve posted on Kickstarter.\nand</li>\n<li>If you have \u201cLiked\u201d a project update.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like to have a public profile, but don\u2019t want others to see your name or profile image on a project\u2019s Community tab, you may choose an account image or name that is not identifiable (e.g., CatLuvr88).\nYou can modify or delete certain information associated with your account (such as your username, profile image, biography and location) from your account settings, and you can change your privacy settings if you want to make your profile private or adjust the default settings.</p>\n<p>Creators are also asked to verify their identities before launching a project.\nOnce this has been done, the creator\u2019s Verified Name will be publicly displayed on their account profile and on any projects they launch.</p>\n<b>Information that isn\u2019t shared publicly</b>\n<p>The following data will not be publicly displayed or revealed to other users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any payment information you provide;</li>\n<li>Your password details;</li>\n<li>Your IP address;</li>\n<li>Your phone number;</li>\n<li>Your date of birth and other identity verification documentation (for creators);</li>\n<li>Private profile information, in accordance with your preferences.\nand</li>\n<li>Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Information that\u2019s shared with trusted third-party services</b>\n<p>We may share your information with certain trusted third-party services to help us provide, improve, promote, or protect Kickstarter\u2019s Services (like when we partner with payment processors, or use services that help us manage our ads on other sites).\nWhen we share data with third-party services that support our delivery of the Kickstarter Services, we require that they use your information only for the purposes we\u2019ve authorized, and that they protect your personal information at least to the same standards we do.\nWe may also share information that\u2019s aggregated and anonymized in a way that it doesn\u2019t directly identify you.</p>\n<b>Information that\u2019s shared with creators and collaborators</b>\n<p>When you back a project, the project\u2019s creator will know your username, the amount you have pledged, and the reward you have selected.\nCreators never receive backers\u2019 credit card details or other payment information.</p>\n<p>If a project you have backed is successfully funded, the creator will receive the email address associated with your Kickstarter account.\nThey may also send you a survey requesting information needed to provide your reward.\n(For instance, they may need your mailing address, or T-shirt size.) Any information you provide in such surveys will be received by the creator.</p>\n<p>Creators are required to keep backer information confidential, except as strictly necessary to communicate with backers directly and fulfill rewards.\nCreators should not ask for personal information that isn\u2019t necessary to provide your reward, and should never request sensitive personal information such as your Social Security number or payment information.\nContact us at support@kickstarter.com if you receive a request for information that seems inappropriate or excessive.</p>\n<p>Collaborators are third parties that creators can appoint to help manage their project.\nThese collaborators may be able to access the information available to creators (including backers\u2019 names, email addresses, pledge amounts, reward selections, messages, and survey responses), and are required to treat backers\u2019 personal information with the same care and respect as creators are.</p>\n<p>Creators and their collaborators may also receive routine traffic analytics about their project pages.</p>\n<b>Information that\u2019s shared to protect Kickstarter and comply with the law</b>\n<p>We do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect Kickstarter\u2019s legal rights, property, or the safety of Kickstarter, its employees, users, or others.</p>\n<b>Links to other websites and services</b>\n<p>Our Site may include links to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from Kickstarter\u2019s.\nWhen you use a link to an external site or service, the privacy policy and data processing disclosures for that site or service governs.</p>\nRetention\n<p>We will retain your information as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide you with the Services or as otherwise set forth in this Policy.\nWe will also retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Kickstarter\u2019s legal rights.</p>\n<p>We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymized information which we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our Site, improve our Services or comply with legal obligations.</p>\nData Transfers\n<p>Because Kickstarter is a US-based company, your information will be collected and processed in the United States.\nThe United States has its own laws governing data protection and government access to information.\nThe rules that protect your personal information under United States law may be different than in your home country.\nIf you choose to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between Kickstarter and its users.</p>\nYour Rights\n<p>Users residing in certain countries, including the EU, are afforded certain rights regarding their personal information.\nExcept where an exception or exemption applies, these rights include the ability to access, correct, and request deletion of your personal information.\nWhile these rights are not applicable globally, all Kickstarter users can manage their personal information, as further described below, in their account settings.</p>\n<p>You can request a downloadable copy of your personal data from Kickstarter from your account settings page.\nTo modify or delete the personal information you\u2019ve provided to us, please log in and update your profile.\nYou may also delete your account from your account settings page.\nWe may retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.</p>\nPrivacy Information for California Residents\n<p>If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information

cookies and other technologies to understand, improve and protect Kickstarter.\nIf you see a capitalized word, it\u2019s defined in our Terms of Use.</p> What they are\n<p>Cookies are small data files that are issued to your device when you visit a website and that store information about your use of a service.\nPixel tags (which are also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) are little snippets of code or tiny images embedded on websites and in email that help us learn how you interact with our site and emails.</p> Why we use them\n<p>Kickstarter uses cookies and these other technologies to help recognize you as a repeat visitor and, to improve the quality of our Services.</p> How they work\n<p>When you visit Kickstarter, our web server sends a cookie to your device, which allows us to recognize your device (but not the specific person using it).\nBy associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other account information when, for example, you log in to our Services, we know that the cookie information relates to your user account.\nSimilarly, pixel tags on Kickstarter and in email communications help us identify how your device is being used to interact with Kickstarter content.\nSome of the tags and cookies used by our Services are served by us, and some are served by trusted partners who are delivering services on our behalf.</p>\n<p>Some examples of the types of cookies and other technologies Kickstarter uses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nAuthentication\n<p>Kickstarter uses authentication cookies and similar technologies to tell us when you\u2019re logged in to Kickstarter.\nThis lets us show you personalized views related to your interests and connect you with projects like those you may already have backed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nSecurity\n<p>Cookies also help keep Kickstarter secure by facilitating security features and allowing us to detect activity that might violate our rules and Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>These cookies help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you, alert you and us when your account is accessed, and provide capabilities that allow us to disable any active sessions you have (for example, when you log out or change your password).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nLocalization\n<p>Some cookies help us provide localized experiences \u2014 for example, by making sure you see Kickstarter in your preferred language.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nSite features and services\n<p>Kickstarter uses cookies that provide functionality and help us deliver our products and services \u2014 for instance, by storing your preferences or by pre-filling the username field when you log in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nPerformance\n<p>Performance cookies help us route traffic between servers and understand how Kickstarter is performing, so we can provide you with the best experience possible.\nWe may use third party software development kits (SDK) in our mobile apps to collect information about activity in the app, the type of device and operating system it is running on and how the app is functioning.\nFor example an SDK may send us a report if the app crashes, and reports on which features of the app are used more than others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nAnalytics and research\n<p>Cookies and other technologies also help us to understand, improve, and research features and content on the Kickstarter site.\nFor example, we may use cookies to understand how you are discovering projects or to determine which types of browsers or devices are accessing Kickstarter.\nYou can opt-out of being included in Google Analytics here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nSocial Media Platforms\n<p>Cookies and other technologies make interacting with social media platforms more seamless.\nFor example, when you\u2019re signed into social media accounts while you use our Services, these technologies enable you to share content with your social network or, in some cases, log in using your social media credentials.\nThese features are usually controlled by the social media platform you are using and are governed by its separate privacy policies and the preferences you set with that service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nMarketing\n<p>Cookies help us deliver targeted advertisements on social media platforms, based on your activity on Kickstarter, including the projects you\u2019ve backed or creators you\u2019ve followed on Kickstarter, and to track the performance of those ads.\nThis is sometimes referred to as online behavioral advertising.\nIn some cases, our partners may use cookies to provide us with information about your interactions with their services.\nThose third-party cookies would be subject to the third party service\u2019s policies.</p>\n<p>You can opt-out of online behavioral advertising.\nThe Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes.\nTo opt out of having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes, click here.</p>\n<p>Certain choices you make are both browser- and device-specific.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nYou can control certain cookies\n<p>Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies.\nHow you do so depends on the type of cookie.\nCertain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies.\nBlocking or deleting cookies may prevent you from using most of our Services.\nTo find out more about how to enable, disable, or delete cookies from your web browser, please visit here.\nTo control flash cookies, which may be used on certain websites from time to time, you can go here.\nWhy? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.</p>\nOur Do Not Track Policy\n<p>Some browsers have \u201cdo not track\u201d features that allow you to tell a website not to

this a nice place.\nDon\u2019t do any of these things on the Site:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Don\u2019t break the law.</b>\nDon\u2019t take any action that infringes or violates other people\u2019s

Kickstarter in an effort to access things like source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms.</li>\n</ul> 4.\nHow Projects Work <p>\nMost of our Terms of Use explain your relationship with Kickstarter.\nThis section is different\u2014it explains the relationship <b>between creators and backers</b> of Kickstarter projects, and who\u2019s responsible for what.\nThis is what you\u2019re agreeing to when you create or back a Kickstarter project.\n</p>\n<p>\nKickstarter provides a funding platform for creative projects.\nWhen a creator posts a project on Kickstarter, they\u2019re inviting other people to form a contract with them.\nAnyone who backs a project is accepting the creator\u2019s offer, and forming that contract.\n</p>\n<p>\nKickstarter is not a part of this contract\u2014the contract is a direct legal agreement between creators and their backers.\nHere are the terms that govern that agreement:\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen a project is successfully funded, <b>the creator must complete the project and fulfill each reward</b>.\nOnce a creator has done so, they\u2019ve satisfied their obligation to their backers.\n</p>\n<p>\nThroughout the process, creators owe their backers a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the project to life.\nAt the same time, backers must understand that they\u2019re not buying something when they back a project\u2014they\u2019re helping to create something new, not ordering something that already exists.\nThere may be changes or delays, and there\u2019s a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the project as promised.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf a creator is unable to complete their project and fulfill rewards, they\u2019ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement.\nTo right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the project to the best possible conclusion for backers.\nA creator in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the project as planned;</li>\n<li>they work diligently and in good faith to bring the project to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that\u2019s communicated to backers;</li>\n<li>they\u2019re able to demonstrate that they\u2019ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the project as promised;</li>\n<li>they\u2019ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers.\nand</li>\n<li>they offer to return any remaining funds to backers who have not received their reward (in proportion to the amounts pledged), or else explain how those funds will be used to complete the project in some alternate form.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThe creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project.\nIf they\u2019re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers.\n</p> 5.\nHow Funding Works <p>\nThis section goes over the details of backing and creating projects\u2014things like how money gets collected, whether pledges can be changed or canceled, and how creators can contact backers to provide rewards.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese are the terms that apply when you\u2019re <b>backing a project</b>:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>You\u2019re only charged if the project reaches its fundraising goal.</b>\nYou\u2019ll provide your payment information when you pledge, but you won\u2019t be charged.\nYour payment will only be collected if, at the time of the project\u2019s funding deadline, the project has reached its fundraising goal.\nThe exact amount you pledged is the amount Kickstarter will collect.\nIf the campaign hasn\u2019t reached its fundraising goal, you won\u2019t be charged, no funds will be collected, and no money will change hands.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>In some cases we\u2019ll reserve the charge on your card.</b>\nKickstarter and its payment partners may authorize or reserve a charge on your credit card (or whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to the full pledge, at any time between the pledge and the collection of funds.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>You can change or cancel your pledge at any time before the project\u2019s funding deadline (with one exception).</b>\nYou can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any time during the campaign, with one exception.\nDuring the last 24 hours of the campaign, you can\u2019t decrease or cancel your pledge without contacting customer support first\u2014if that action would drop the project below its funding goal.\nOnce the project has been funded, you can only cancel or change your pledge by making special arrangements directly with the creator.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>The estimated delivery is the creator\u2019s <i> estimate.</i>\n</b>\nThe month and year listed on each reward is the creator\u2019s estimate of when they will provide the reward\u2014not a guarantee to fulfill by that time.\nThe schedule may change as the creator works on the project.\nWe ask creators to think carefully, set an estimated delivery they feel confident they can work toward, and communicate with backers about any changes.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>The creator may need to send you questions about your reward.</b>\nTo deliver rewards, the creator might need information from you, like your mailing address or t-shirt size.\nThey\u2019ll request that information after the campaign has succeeded.\nTo receive the reward, you\u2019ll need to provide the information in a reasonable amount of time.\nCreators should not ask for personal information that is not necessary to provide your reward, and should never request sensitive personal information such as your Social Security number or payment information.\nContact us at support@kickstarter.com if you receive a request for information that seems inappropriate or excessive.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Kickstarter doesn\u2019t offer refunds.</b>\nResponsibility for finishing a project lies entirely with the project creator.\nKickstarter doesn\u2019t hold funds on creators\u2019 behalf, cannot guarantee creators\u2019 work, and does not offer refunds.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThese are the terms that apply when you\u2019re <b>creating a project:</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>You can refund individual pledges if you want.</b>\nAfter your project has been funded, you can cancel and refund a backer\u2019s pledge at any time.\nIf you do, you have no further obligation to that specific backer, and no agreement exists between you.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>We\u2019ll charge our fees before putting funds in your account.</b>\nKickstarter and its payment partners will subtract fees before transmitting the proceeds of a campaign.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Some pledges can\u2019t be collected, which might reduce the amount of funding you get.</b>\nBecause some payments can\u2019t be collected\u2014for instance, when a backer\u2019s credit card expires before funding ends, and they don\u2019t provide updated information\u2014we can\u2019t guarantee that the amount of funding you receive will be exactly equal to the full amount pledged minus fees.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>We'll help resolve payment-card disputes.</b>\nIf a backer of your project disputes the charge with their card issuer, we'll handle re-presenting the charge to settle the dispute with the card issuer.\nYou\u2019ll be notified that a dispute has been filed, and you\u2019ll be able to provide evidence to help us resolve it in your favor.\nIf the cardholder\u2019s dispute is found valid, you authorize us to charge the credit card number you provided when you started your project for the amount of the chargeback.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Prepare for potential delays.</b>\nDon\u2019t assume you\u2019ll be able to launch your project when you want.\nthere could be a reason we\u2019re not able to accept it, or a problem that takes time to resolve.\nDon\u2019t assume you\u2019ll be able to immediately collect your funding.\nthere may be a delay between the end of a successful campaign and your access to the funds.\nAnd don\u2019t take any actions in reliance on collecting any of the money pledged until you actually have the ability to withdraw it from your account and spend it.\n</li>\n</ul> 6.\nStuff We Don\u2019t Do and Aren\u2019t Responsible For <p>\nWe don\u2019t oversee projects\u2019 performance, and we don\u2019t mediate disputes between users.\n</p>\n<p>\nKickstarter isn\u2019t liable for any damages or losses related to your use of the Services.\nWe don\u2019t become involved in disputes between users, or between users and any third party relating to the use of the Services.\nWe don\u2019t oversee the performance or punctuality of projects, and we don\u2019t endorse any content users submit to the Site.\nWhen you use the Services, you release Kickstarter from claims, damages, and demands of every kind\u2014known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed\u2014arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and the Services.\nAll content you access through the Services is at your own risk.\nYou\u2019re solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.\n</p> 7.\nOur Fees <p>\nWe only charge our 5% fee on successfully funded projects, in addition to any fees from our payment partners.\n</p>\n<p>\nCreating an account on Kickstarter is free.\nIf you create a project that reaches its funding goal, we collect a 5% fee and our payment partners collect fees.\nOur partners\u2019 fees may vary slightly based on your location.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe will not collect any fees without giving you a chance to review and accept them.\nIf our fees ever change, we\u2019ll announce that on our Site.\nSome funds pledged by backers are collected by payment providers.\nEach payment provider is its own company, and Kickstarter isn\u2019t responsible for its performance.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou\u2019re responsible for paying any additional fees or taxes associated with your use of Kickstarter.\n</p> 8.\nOther Websites <p>\nIf you follow a link to another website, what happens there is between you and them\u2014not us.\n</p>\n<p>\nKickstarter may contain links to other websites.\n(For instance, project pages, user profiles, and comments may link to other sites.) When you access third-party websites, you do so at your own risk.\nWe don\u2019t control or endorse those sites.\n</p>\n<p>\nKickstarter partners with other companies (such as Stripe) for payment processing.\nWhen you back or create a project, you\u2019re also agreeing to the payment processor\u2019s terms of service.\n</p> 9.\nYour Intellectual Property <p>\nWe don't own the content you post on Kickstarter, but we do have your permission to use or copy it however we need.\nWe generally use it to promote projects and showcase our community.\nUltimately, you're responsible for the content you post, and you're vouching to us that it's ok to use.\n</p>\n<p>\nKickstarter doesn\u2019t own content you submit to us (your \u201cContent\u201d).\nBut we do need certain licenses from you in order to perform our Services.\nWhen you submit a project for review, or launch a project, you agree to these terms:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>We can use the Content you\u2019ve submitted.</b>\nYou grant to us, and others acting on our behalf, the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right to use, exercise, commercialize, and exploit the copyright, publicity, trademark, and database rights with respect to your Content.\nIn general, we use this Content to promote projects and showcase our community on the website.\nThere are many factors that we take into consideration before featuring a project on the homepage or giving it a Project We Love badge.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, a crisp project image with no logos, badges, or text on top, a clear and detailed description that includes a thorough plan for completing your project, captivating images or videos, an excited community, what we think different users will be interested in, and of course, a lot of creativity.\nIn addition to giving some projects a Project We Love badge, we also carefully curate the homepage to highlight great examples of Kickstarter projects.\nThe projects at the very top of the homepage typically are best-of-the-best Projects We Love\u2014based on factors such as creative innovation, honesty, and alignment with Kickstarter\u2019s mission and charter\u2014but we also use algorithms to surface popular projects, projects your friends have backed and launched, and projects recommended just for you.\nWe may also recommend projects that are gaining traction as a result of their creator\u2019s own advertising, and/or on the basis of a user\u2019s prior search terms, browsing history, project backings and other interactions, and cookies we have collected during their visits to our website.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>When we use the Content, we can make changes, like editing or translating it.</b>\nYou grant us the right to edit, modify, reformat, excerpt, delete, or translate any of your Content.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>You won\u2019t submit stuff you don\u2019t hold the copyright for (unless you have permission).</b>\nYour Content will not contain third-party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third-party proprietary rights, unless you have permission from the rightful owner of the material, or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material (and to grant Kickstarter all the license rights outlined here).\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Any royalties or licensing on your Content are your responsibility.</b>\nYou will pay all royalties and other amounts owed to any person or entity based on your Content, or on Kickstarter\u2019s hosting of that Content.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>You promise that if we use your Content, we\u2019re not violating anyone\u2019s rights or copyrights.</b>\nIf Kickstarter or its users exploit or make use of your submission in the ways contemplated in this agreement, you promise that this will not infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including (without limitation) any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>You\u2019re responsible for the stuff you post.</b>\nAll information submitted to the Site, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom that Content originated.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>We\u2019re not responsible for mistakes in your Content.</b>\nKickstarter will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any Content.\n</li>\n</ul> 10.\nKickstarter\u2019s Intellectual Property <p>\nThe content on Kickstarter is protected in various ways.\nYou do have the right to use it for certain personal purposes, but you can\u2019t use it for anything commercial without getting permission first.\n</p>\n<p>\nKickstarter\u2019s

If you want to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, or store any of this content for a commercial purpose, you need prior written permission from Kickstarter or the relevant copyright holder.\nA \u201ccommercial purpose\u201d means you intend to use, sell, license, rent, or otherwise exploit content for commercial use, in any way.\n</p> 11.\nHow We Deal with Copyright Issues <p>\nWe comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\nTo learn more about how we deal with claims of copyright infringement, read our Copyright Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act lays out a system of legal requirements for dealing with allegations of copyright infringement.\nKickstarter complies with the DMCA, and we respond to notices of alleged infringement if they comply with the law and the requirements set forth in our Copyright Policy.\nWe reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate accounts for repeat infringers.\n(We do this when appropriate and at our sole discretion.)\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you\u2019d like to submit a claim of copyright infringement, please visit our Copyright Policy.\nOur designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement is:\n</p>\n<p>\nKickstarter, PBC\n<br>\nAttn: Copyright Agent\n<br>\n58 Kent Street\n<br>\nBrooklyn, NY 11222, USA\n<br>\ncopyright@kickstarter.com\n</p> 12.\nDeleting Your Account <p>\nYou can delete your account at any time, but doing so won\u2019t automatically remove some content you\u2019ve already posted.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou can terminate your account at any time through your account settings.\nWe may retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.\nAll provisions of this agreement survive termination of an account, including our rights regarding any content you\u2019ve already submitted to the Site.\n(For instance, if you\u2019ve launched a project, deleting your account will not automatically remove the project from the Site.) You can contact us at support@kickstarter.com for additional information or to request project page deletion (this is not available in all circumstances).\n</p> 13.\nOur Rights <p>\nTo operate, we need to be able to maintain control over what happens on our website.\nSo in this section, we reserve the right to make decisions to protect the health and integrity of our system.\nWe don\u2019t take these powers lightly, and we only use them when we absolutely have to.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo protect the health and integrity of our system and to help ensure that creators and backers enjoy a safe and secure environment, Kickstarter reserves these rights:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can make changes to the Kickstarter Site and Services without notice or liability.</li>\n<li>We have the right to decide who\u2019s eligible to use Kickstarter.\nWe may in limited circumstances impose restrictions or limitations on accounts, or\u2014for particularly significant or repeated violations of our Terms or any other rules on the Site, like our Community Guidelines and rules for starting projects\u2014we may cancel accounts or decline to offer our Services.\n(Especially if you\u2019re abusing them.)

right to cancel any pledge to any project, at any time and for any reason.</li>\n<li>We have the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend any project at any time and for any

action.\nHowever, if we impose restrictions on or limit a verified account holder\u2019s access to any of our Services or if we intend to cancel a verified account, we will let the account holder know the reasons for this action and how they can remedy any issues (where appropriate), unless we\u2019re prohibited from doing so by law or in the interest of safety.\nFor account cancelations, we will let the account holder know the reasons for this action at least 30 days in advance, unless we\u2019re canceling for reasons related to illicit or inappropriate content, the safety of a good or service, counterfeiting, fraud, malware, spam, data breaches, other cybersecurity risks, or the suitability of a good or service for minors.\n</p> 14.\nWarranty Disclaimer <p>\nWe work hard to provide

16.\nLimitation of Liability <p>\nIf something bad happens as a result of your using Kickstarter, we\u2019re not liable (beyond a small amount).\n</p>\n<p>\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Kickstarter, its directors, employees, partners, suppliers, or content providers be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, consequential, special, or exemplary damages of any kind, including but not limited to damages (i) resulting from your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the Services.\n(ii) for any lost profits, data loss, or cost of procurement or substitute goods or services.\nor (iii) for any conduct of content of any third party on the Site.\nIn no event shall Kickstarter\u2019s liability for direct damages be in excess of (in the aggregate) one hundred U.S.\ndollars ($100.00).\n</p> 17.\nDispute Resolution and Governing Law <p>\nWe\u2019re located in New York, and any disputes with us have to be handled in New York under New York State law.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe at Kickstarter encourage you to contact us if you\u2019re having an issue before resorting to the courts.\nOur Kickstarter support team is on hand and ready to answer your questions.\nYou can visit our Help Center to find articles with information that may resolve your issue.\nIf you still have questions, you can click \u201cContact us\u201d in the Help Center or email support@kickstarter.com so that one of our support team agents can personally reply to you and attempt to resolve your issue.\nThese resources are easily accessible and free.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you\u2019re a creator based in the European Union and, after contacting us through those channels, you still don\u2019t feel as if your issue has been resolved, we may agree with you to engage in mediation to resolve any complaints in good faith.\nYou may address your complaint with one of these two mediation organizations:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR)</li>\n<li>IPOS Mediation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIn the unfortunate situation where legal action does arise, these Terms (and all other rules, policies, or guidelines incorporated by reference) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law, and without application of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act or the United Nations Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods.\nYou agree that Kickstarter and its Services are deemed a passive website that does not give rise to jurisdiction over Kickstarter or its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers, or shareholders, either specific or general, in any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.\nYou agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms, or your use or non-use of Kickstarter, shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.\nYou hereby irrevocably waive any right you may have to trial by jury in any dispute, action, or proceeding.\n</p> 18.\nThe Rest <p>\nThese are our official terms and our rules for how things work.\nYou can verify any confusing or conflicting information you see elsewhere by referencing what we\u2019ve explained on this page.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese Terms and the other material referenced in them are the entire agreement between you and Kickstarter with respect to the Services.\nThey supersede all other communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and Kickstarter with respect to the Services and govern our future relationship.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid under the law, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms otherwise will remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nThe failure of either you or Kickstarter to exercise any right provided for in these Terms in any way won\u2019t be deemed a waiver of any other rights.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese Terms are personal to you.\nYou can\u2019t assign them, transfer them, or sublicense them unless you get Kickstarter\u2019s prior written consent.\nKickstarter has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent.\nKickstarter will provide you notice via email, written notice, or by conspicuously posting the notice on our Site.\n</p> FIN <p>\nKickstarter Terms of Use Updates\n</p>\n<p>\nThese updated terms went into effect on August 13, 2020 at 12 am Eastern Time, and apply to all projects launched on Kickstarter on or after that date.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe want to be as transparent as possible about the changes we make to our Terms of Use.\nIn this archive, you can see versions of our Terms of Use from 2012 to the present.\nWhere available, we\u2019ve also included comparisons of the version to the previous version to make
