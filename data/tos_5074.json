rights in and to the Service and all of its related content not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>The grant of this license is not, and shall not be construed as, a grant of any

to determine if you need the other party's permission to record a call.\nEven if your state only requires the permission of one party, you should be aware that it is possible to make calls to or receive calls from people located in states that require the permission of both parties to record a call.\nIf you record such a call without the knowledge and permission of the other person, you may be subject to criminal prosecution in the other state.</p>\n<p>You must also confirm that phone number you are calling is not on the national \u201cDo Not Call\u201d registry or any similar \u201cdo

chosen to require you to call only to people who you know personally and by using the Services you represent and warrant that you will adhere to this restriction.\nCalling strangers can result in

additional terms in this section.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You represent and warrant that you have not and will not use this Feature for commercial purposes.\nUsing the Feature in connection with telemarketing or debt-collection, for example, may be a violation of the law as well as a violation of these terms.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may not use the Services to commit fraud or make misrepresentations even if those misrepresentations do not arise to the level of a legal violation.\nThis feature should currently only be used to call phone numbers in the United States.\nThe FTC
