engine, or by clicking on one of our adverts).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal information we receive from other sources:</strong>\n<br>Although we mainly collect information directly from you, there are circumstances where we collect information from third party sources.\nThese circumstances include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Affiliates</strong> - We operate an affiliate programme under which third parties advertise our website on our behalf.\nIf you click on one of those advertisements you are directed to our website using a technology that allows us to understand which affiliate referred you.\nWe then track if you make a booking, and if you do, we attribute that booking to the affiliate for the purposes of paying them a commission.\nHowever, we don't provide the affiliate

explains how Hostelworld makes use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies.</li>\n</ul> Why do you use my personal data? <p>As you probably expect, the main reason we use your personal data is in order to process your accommodation and tour/experience bookings and to deal with any queries or issues that arise in relation to those bookings.\nWe also use your personal data for a number of other reasons, such as tailoring adverts and our marketing emails so they are relevant to you, monitoring your use of the HW Platform to help us make improvements, and to provide the additional services that we make available on our website and apps.\nFor more details about why we use your personal data, click here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Bookings</strong> - We use your personal data in order to process bookings with properties and tour/experience providers and aggregators, and to let you manage your bookings through the HW Platform.\nWhere we process personal data for this purpose, we will do so either on the basis that we have a contractual obligation to you or a third party to do so, or on the basis of our legitimate interests in providing the booking service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Queries and Complaints</strong> - When you send us a query in relation to a booking, or if you have a complaint in relation to a property or tour/experience, we will process your personal data in order to answer your query or in order to help resolve your complaint.\nWhere we process personal data in the context of a query or complaint, we will do so on the basis of our legitimate interest in resolving customer queries and complaints.\nIf you volunteer data in relation to your health, we will process that personal data on the basis that you consent to us using it in order to resolve your query or complaint only.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reviews</strong> - When you provide a review for a property or tour/experience, we will publish this on the property's page or the tour/experience\u2019s page on our website, and on our some of our partners' sites.\nWe will display the text of your review, alongside details of your gender, age range, home country and number of previous reviews.\nIf you have not opted to be anonymous, we will also display your username alongside your review.\nOur processing of your personal data in order to make reviews available is on the basis of our legitimate interest in making the review system available to our users.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Providing and Improving our Services</strong> - Where we collect data in relation to your use of our services, such as your device details and how you interact with our services, we use this data in order to deliver our services and personalise your experience (e.g.\nif you turn on location services on your mobile device, we will use this as part of the search function).\nWe also use the data to test new features that we are thinking about introducing, to analyse how our website is used, and to evaluate and improve our services.\nIf we find a problem on our websites or apps, we will use your data in order to fix any bugs that we find.\nWe may also process your personal data as part of our development work, where we take a copy of our database and test our code on that before rolling it out to the live version of the database.\nWhere possible, we use this data on an anonymous basis, but sometimes this might not be possible.\nAll of this processing of your personal data is on the basis of our legitimate interests in operating, improving and securing our services.\nPlease also see our separate notice in relation to the testing that we undertake.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Analysis/Reporting</strong> - We use data in relation to bookings in order to create internal reports using Google Analytics regarding how our business is operating, such as determining how what we spend on advertising affects the number of bookings that are made.\nWe also use this data for other commercial analysis purposes, and to try to predict future trends that may affect our business.\nThis processing is undertaken on an aggregated basis, so you are not identifiable from the reports or analysis that is produced.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising</strong> - We always want to ensure that when you see a Hostelworld advert, it will be relevant to you and your interests, whether the advert appears on a website we operate, in our marketing emails or on a third-party site.\nWe may also use the same information to show you adverts for carefully selected third-party products and services.\nWe do this in a number of ways, either ourselves or through the use of third-party advertisers: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Making Adverts Relevant To You</strong> - When you are using our websites and apps, we use the searches you have made and the properties and tours/experiences that you have looked at in order to tailor our adverts to your interests.\nFor example, if you have been searching for hostels in Paris or tours in Bangkok, we might use this information to display adverts to you on our websites and on third party websites for hostels in Paris or tours in Bangkok that you might be interested in.\nWe may also use this information in order to tailor the adverts that appear in our email newsletter.\nWe may also use data about your past transactions on the website to tailor our advertising.\nFor example, if we notice you haven't made any bookings for a while, we might send you a credit to your account as an incentive to make a new booking.\nWe process your personal data in connection with tailoring our adverts on the basis of our legitimate interests in ensuring that our advertising is effective.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Segmentation</strong> - When we develop some of our advertising campaigns, we have certain groups of people in mind who we want to see the advert.\nThis might be people in a particular age range, people who have made a booking recently, or people from a particular geographic location or who speak a particular language.\nWe use the data that we hold in order to create groups of people that we then display an advert to or ask our third-party advertising partners to display an advert to.\nWe process your personal data in connection with creating these groups of people on the basis of our legitimate interests in ensuring that our advertising, or the advertising of third parties, is effective.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Audience Matching</strong> - Some of our advertising partners, like Facebook and Twitter, provide a feature that helps us to identify if we have customers or users in common.\nRather than sharing personal data with our advertising partners in order to find out if we have customers or users in common, we actually share what is known as a \"hash\" of the data that we hold (such as an email address).\nA hash is created by a computer programme that converts data into a string of numbers and letters, but only operates in one direction.\nThis means that you can't use a hash to find out the underlying information, but if you run the hash on the same data you always get the same results.\nOur advertising partners compare their hashes with the hashes we send them, and if there is a match you are added to our custom audience.\nThe hashes are then deleted by the advertising partner.\nWe use audience matching to enable us to show you more relevant adverts, or to ensure that we don't show you an advert that isn't relevant to you.\nWe process your personal data in connection with audience matching on the basis of our legitimate interests in ensuring that our advertising, or the advertising of third parties, is effective.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Emails and App Notifications</strong> - Where we have collected your email address in the context of providing you with a service and you have not opted out of receiving email marketing, we may send you emails that we think will be useful to you.\nThis may include our regular e-newsletter, special offers, travel tips, customer surveys and information about products and services offered by us.\nIf you have given your consent, we will send you offers from selected third parties.\nThese emails may include advertising that has been tailored using other information that we hold about you, as set out above in the 'Advertising' section.\nWhere your settings on your device permit us to send app notifications, we may also send you app notifications containing similar information.\nYou may opt out of receiving email messages at any time by clicking on the link provided in the email messages, and app notifications can be disabled by changing the notification settings in your app.\nAlthough when we send you an email or app notification this may in certain circumstances be on the basis of your consent, for all other purposes our processing of your personal data in connection with those emails or app notifications is on the basis of our legitimate interests in ensuring that our advertising is effective.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Affiliate Programme</strong> - We operate an affiliate programme under which third parties advertise our website on our behalf.\nIf you click on one of those advertisements you are directed to our website using a technology that allows us to understand which affiliate referred you.\nWe then track if you make a booking, and if you do, we attribute that booking to the affiliate for the purposes of paying them a commission.\nHowever, we don't provide the affiliate with any personal information in relation to you.\nWe process your personal data in connection with our affiliate programme on the basis of our legitimate interest in operating an effective commission based affiliate advertising programme.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Competitions</strong> - We often run competitions on our website and on our social media channels.\nWhen we operate a competition, we may take the opportunity to also ask you some market research questions, so that we can better understand our business and your needs.\nWe will therefore process your personal data in order to operate the competition, and for market research purposes.\nWe process your personal data in connection with operating competitions on the basis of our legitimate interest in operating the competition and conducting market research.\nPlease note that competitions may be subject to their own data protection notices and separate terms and conditions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Surveys</strong> - We sometimes undertake market research surveys to better understand our customers and prospective customers.\nThese can be general surveys to understand the market, or they might be more specific to you.\nFor example, we may want to understand if you are generally positive about Hostelworld or if you have concerns.\nWe may then send you tailored communications on the basis of the survey responses.\nWhere this is the case.\nwe will let you know at the time that you complete the survey.\nWe process your personal data in connection with our surveys on the basis of our legitimate interest in conducting market research and promoting our brands.\nPlease note that surveys may be subject to their own data protection notices and separate terms and conditions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Webinars</strong> - We regularly run webinars on our website on topics we understand to be important to You and to promote new features and technologies we are developing and rolling out.\nWe will therefore process your personal data in order to run the webinar and for follow-up market research purposes \u2013 We may contact You after the webinar to get Your feedback on the content, guest speakers and overall experience.\nWe may also ask you if you consent to being contacted by guest speakers to discuss the topic of the webinar.\nWe process your personal data in connection with running webinars on the basis of our legitimate interest in running webinars and conducting follow-up market research.\nPlease note that webinars may be subject to the data protection notices and separate terms and conditions of the webinar software platform.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Monitoring/Analytics </strong> - We use a variety of tools to give us insights into how our sites and apps are used to enable us to better tailor the customer experience, respond to market trends and resolve technical impediments those using the sites and apps may encounter.\n<ul>\n<li>We use Hotjar, which facilitates the visual representation of clicks, taps and scrolling behaviour to better understand how users interact with our sites to better inform our UI/UX decision making abilities.\nThe privacy details on Hotjar can be found here.</li>\n<li>We use Snowflake, a cloud-native data warehouse that supports our data analysis.\nThe privacy details of Snowflake can be found here.</li>\n<li>We use Tableau which has analytical tools to aid in visualising and understanding our raw data.\nThe privacy details of Tableau can be found here.</li>\n<li>We also use a number of tools, including Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics, to better understand how our sites and apps are being used and enable us to build the right solution for you.\nThis means we can find out what works and what doesn't, optimise and improve our websites or apps, understand the effectiveness of advertisements and communications, and ensure we continue to be interesting and relevant.\nThe data we gather can include which web pages you have viewed, which referring/exit pages you have entered and left from, which platform type you have used, which emails you have opened and acted upon, and date and time stamp information.\nIt also means we can use details about how you\u2019ve interacted with the site, such as the number of clicks you make on a given page, your mouse movements and scrolling activity, the search words you use and the text you enter into various fields.\nWe send Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics website interaction data.\nIn order to control the collection of data for analytical purposes through Google Analytics from certain browser types, you may want to visit the following link: Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on (only for desktop).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> Information you are required to provide <p>You are not obliged to provide us with any of your personal data.\nHowever, if you want to make a booking, you will need to provide us with the information that is indicated as required on our checkout page.\nIf you don't provide us with this information, we won't be able to process your booking.\nSimilarly, you may be required to provide certain information if you want to enter into a competition, participate in a survey, book a tour/experience with a travel service provider or if you contact our Customer Services team with a query or complaint.\nWe will inform you where such information is required.</p> Who do we share your personal data with? <p>In order to process your booking, we have to send your details to the property or tour/experience provider/aggregator that you have booked.\nThis includes making your credit or debit card details (not including the CVV code, which we do not store) available to the property or tour/experience provider/aggregator in order for them to take payments where this is required (e.g.\nthe charges that are applicable if you fail to show up at a property or tour/experience and have not cancelled your booking in accordance with the travel service provider\u2019s cancellation policy).\nIf you purchase an ancillary service, we may need to share personal data with the third-party service provider so that they can provide you with that service.</p>\n<p>As part of our online advertising programmes, we may share your personal data with third parties, who will combine it with data that they hold about you in order to tailor adverts that appear on third-party websites (which may be our own adverts, or adverts we serve on behalf of third parties).\nWhere this data is shared, you are not directly identifiable from the information itself, as we use technologies that use non-personally identifiable codes and tags.</p>\n<p>We also use a number of service providers to assist us in providing our services, some of whom will have access to your data (e.g.\nwe use various software service providers who host our data as part of their services).\nWhere we engage a third party to process your data on our behalf, we take reasonable steps to sure that they respect your privacy rights and that they process data in accordance with applicable data protection law.</p>\n<p>Although we hope it never happens, on very rare occasions our customers can get into difficulties whilst travelling.\nWhere we think that there is a risk to your health or wellbeing, we may share your personal data with third parties in order to get you help (e.g.\nwe might be asked to assist with locating a missing person).\nWe may also receive requests from law enforcement agencies for personal data that we hold.\nIn such circumstances we will only share your personal data with such law enforcement agencies in compliance with applicable data protection law.</p>\n<p>For further details of third parties who we share your personal data

complaints or make sure that they keep up the good work.\nIf you contact us with a query or complaint in relation to a property we may also share details of the query or complaint with the property so that we can resolve it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tour/Experience Providers and Aggregators</strong> - We share details of your tour/experience booking with tour/experience operators and/or aggregators like Viator including, but not limited to: your name, date of birth, height, passport number and expiry, nationality, email address and booking details.\nTour/experience aggregators will also further share your information with tour/experience operators in accordance with own privacy policies.\nWe also share details of any reviews that you provide in relation to the tour/experience, so that they can address any complaints or make sure that they keep up the good work.\nIf you contact us with a query or complaint in relation to a tour/experience, we may also share details of the query or complaint with the tour/experience provider or aggregate so that we can help resolve it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Group Companies</strong>&nbsp;- There are a number of companies in our group that help us to provide our services.\nThis includes a subsidiary in the UK that provides help with our marketing initiatives, a subsidiary in Portugal that provides development services, and a subsidiary in China that helps to service our customers in Asia.\nWe also have branch offices in China and Australia that help us service those markets.\nThese subsidiaries and offices may have access to your personal data in providing us with intra-group services, but they only process it in accordance with our instructions under our intra-group data processing procedures and subject to appropriate safeguards and measures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Service Providers</strong>&nbsp;- As you can imagine, operating the world's largest online hostel booking platform requires a lot of work behind the scenes.\nWe use a large number of specialist service providers to assist us in operating our business and to provide us with specialist services.\nNot all of these service providers will have access to your personal data, but where they do, we make sure that they are carefully selected by us to ensure that they respect your privacy rights.\nThe categories of service providers that we currently engage include the following:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Hosting Providers</strong>&nbsp;- We use various cloud service providers such as Google to help us host and manage our data.\nThis means that the data is hosted remotely by the third party, and access by us in Hostelworld, rather than sitting on our systems.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment Processors</strong>&nbsp;- We use third-party payment processors in order to assist us with taking payments on our website such as Stripe and Worldpay.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer Relationship Management</strong>&nbsp;- We use third-party provider, Zendesk, to host our

sometimes engage expert consultants to help us implement new technologies or services, or to provide us with insights into how we run our business and how we might improve it.\nThis sometimes requires us to provide access to our systems to those third parties, which means that they may have access to where your personal data is stored.\nWe always make sure that any such access is limited to what is strictly necessary, and subject to appropriate security procedures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Auditors</strong>&nbsp;- We have an internal and external audit function that is provided by third parties.\nThe auditors help us to ensure that we are complying with our legal obligations, including in relation to our processing of personal data.\nIn certain circumstances this may mean that they have access to our systems that process personal data, or that they might need to review how we have processed certain personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third-Party Advertisers</strong>&nbsp;- When we purchase advertising on third-party websites, we may share information with them about your use of our services, which they then combine with the information that they hold about you in order to implement the particular advertising campaign.\nThe data that is shared with third-party advertisers relates to how you use our websites and apps, such as the pages you have visited, the searches you have made, and whether you have made a booking.\nWe use specialist service providers to help us purchase advertising, and to transfer the information about your use of our services to third party advertisers that is required for those third party advertisers to be able to show you the correct advert.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ancillary Services</strong>&nbsp;- We sometimes work with partners to make services available to you that we think will be useful, such as travel insurance.\nIf you avail of one of these services, we may need to provide your details to that third party in order to allow them to provide the service.\nWe may also share non-personally identifiable information with the third party to enable them to track that we referred you to them.</li>\n</ul> Transfers of Personal Data <p>There are certain circumstances where we will transfer your personal data outside of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) / European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) to a country which is not recognised by the European Commission as providing an equivalent level of protection for personal data as is provided for in the EU/EEA.\nThe most common of these is where we transfer personal data to an accommodation provider or tour/experience operator or aggregator that they can fulfil your booking.\nWe may also transfer your personal data outside of the EU/EEA in connection with the operation of our business, such as when we use a service provider that is based in another jurisdiction.\nIf we transfer your personal data outside of the EU/EEA, please rest assured that we will ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect your personal data and to comply with our obligations under applicable data protection law.\nPlease&nbsp;click here&nbsp;for more details.</p>\n<p>When we transfer your personal data outside of the EU/EEA, if required under applicable data protection law we will, prior to sharing your personal data) establish the necessary means to ensure an adequate level of data protection.\nThis may be an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the respective non-EU/EEA country or an agreement on the basis of the EU Standard Model Clauses (a set of non-negotiable contract clauses approved and issued by the European Commission).\nWe will provide further information on the means to ensure an adequate level of data protection on request.\nIf you would like further details about the measures we have taken in relation to the transfer of your personal data, or copies of the agreements that we have put in place in relation to the transfers, please contact us using the details at the bottom of this notice.</p> Retention of personal data <p>We retain your personal data in accordance with our record retention policy.\nThe record retention policy operates on the principle that we keep personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which we collected it, and in accordance with any requirements that are imposed on us by law.\nThis means that the retention period for your personal data will vary depending on the type of personal data.\nFor further information about the criteria that we apply to determine retention periods please&nbsp;click here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Transaction Data</strong>&nbsp;- If you are an active user of the HW Platform (i.e.\nyou have made a booking in the last 18 months) we want to ensure that you have access to data in relation to your previous bookings, and that we have access to this data for our own business purposes.\nWe therefore won't delete your transaction data whilst you remain an active customer, unless you ask us to do so.\nIf you cease to be an active customer, we will retain your personal data for a period of 4 years, in case you return to our website and want to continue using your account, and also so that we can continue to use transaction data to improve our services and undertake business analysis.\nAfter this 4 year period, we anonymise the data, so that it is no longer possible for us to link it to you.\nHowever, our anonymisation process does let us re-identify you if you return to our site and use the same email address to make a booking.\nPlease also note that if you are subscribed to our marketing database, we will retain certain details even after the 4 year period expires, as set out below.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Email Marketing</strong>&nbsp;- We will keep a copy of personal data that is required in order to send you marketing messages for as long as you are subscribed to receive those marketing messages.\nWe will also retain certain information in relation to your transactions in order to allow us to customise our marketing messages.\nIf you are subscribed to receive marketing messages and your transaction data is anonymised in our main database, we will continue to retain certain details in relation to your transactions, such as where you have booked properties before, what types of property you have booked, whether you have used our apps or our websites, your average length of stay, and what countries you have made bookings for and in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For personal data that is not transaction data or related to email marketing, we will apply the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Managing legal claims</strong>&nbsp;\u2013 When we assess how long we keep personal data, we take into account whether that data may be required in order to defend any legal claims which may be made.\nIf such data is required, we may keep it until the statute of limitations runs out in relation to the type of claim that can be made (which varies from 2 to 12 years).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business requirements</strong>&nbsp;\u2013 As we only collect personal data for defined purposes, we assess how long we need to keep personal data for in order to meet our reasonable business purposes.</li>\n</ul> Important Information about Consent <p>When we process your personal data on the basis of your consent, you are free to withdraw that consent at any time.\nYou can withdraw your consent by contacting us using the contact details at the bottom of this

suppliers.\nHowever, We are not a travel or tour agency, and We do not provide such accommodation, travel or tour experiences ourselves.\nWhen you make a booking on the Hostelworld Sites, you will be purchasing accommodation, tours, tickets or other services directly from the third-party supplier.</p>\n<p>All references to \"We\", \"Us\" or \"Our\" in these terms refer to Hostelworld.com Limited (\"Hostelworld\"), the operator of the Hostelworld Sites.\nWhen We refer to \"you\" or \u201cyour\u201d, We mean any person that accesses or uses the Hostelworld Sites.\nYour use of the Hostelworld

travel services as agents solely for and on behalf of third-party travel services providers.\nOur role is simply to facilitate you finding and choosing travel services.\nWe do not act as an agent on your behalf in respect of any travel service booking with any travel services provider.\nWe do not provide, own or run any travel services ourselves and in particular, We do not provide, own or run any accommodation.\nAlthough We provide the Hostelworld Sites with information about travel services and facilitate bookings, such actions do not in any way constitute Hostelworld's sponsorship or approval of such third party suppliers, or any affiliation between Hostelworld and any third party supplier.\nAlthough Hostelworld users may rate and write reviews of particular travel services based on their own experiences, Hostelworld does not endorse or recommend any travel services.\nYou agree that Hostelworld is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information it obtains from third party suppliers and/or that is displayed on the Hostelworld Sites.</p>\n<p>2.2 By accessing, browsing and using the Hostelworld Sites, you confirm that you are of sufficient age to use the

services provider.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, We do not act as your agent and have no authority to negotiate or conclude any agreement with a travel services provider on your behalf.\nYou enter into the relevant agreement(s) with the travel services provider and any other agreements relating to the travel services or ancillary services, on your own behalf.\nIt is the travel services provider's responsibility to provide you with the travel services.\nWe are not responsible for the fulfilment of any booking made through the Hostelworld Sites or for the quality of any accommodation or any other travel services that are booked.</p>\n<p>2.4 Please note that all bookings are strictly subject to the Hostelworld booking terms and conditions that will be displayed to you prior to you confirming your booking.</p> 3.\nMaking, Amending and Cancelling a Booking\n<p>3.1 On making an accommodation booking, you will be required to pay:</p>\n<p>(a) where you select a Non-Refundable Booking rate or Flexible Non-Refundable Booking rate, the total price of your accommodation which We collect (in full or in part) for and on behalf of the travel services provider.\nThis amount will always be non-refundable unless the travel services provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.\nor</p>\n<p>(b) a deposit (being a part payment towards the total value of your booking) which We collect for and on behalf of the travel services provider.\nThis amount will always be non-refundable unless the travel services provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy unless:</p>\n<p>(i) the Standard Flexible Booking option is available and you choose to select it, in which case the deposit will be added back to your Hostelworld account in the form of a voucher if you cancel your booking in certain circumstances (see below for more details).\nor</p>\n<p>(ii) the Free Cancellation Booking option is available and you choose to select it, in which case the deposit will be refunded back to your chosen method of payment within a commercially reasonable period of time from the date of cancellation if you cancel your booking within the specified time period on the Hostelworld Sites at the time of booking.</p>\n<p>3.2 Where you select a Non-Refundable Booking rate or Flexible Non-Refundable Booking rate, the total cost of your booking will be charged any time after your booking has been confirmed.\nUpon confirming your booking, a deposit of the total amount will be charged onto your card straight away.\nThe outstanding balance due for your booking will be charged on your card by the travel service provider any time from the moment of booking.\nIf for some reason the travel service provider is unable to charge your card for the outstanding balance due for your booking, they may reach out to you directly and give you, at their discretion, a period of time during which you can provide an alternative payment method to charge the balance.\nIf you do not provide an alternative payment method to the travel service provider within the time period given to you, the travel service provider reserves the right to cancel your booking and the deposit amount will be non-refundable.</p>\n<p>3.3 Where you make an accommodation booking on a Flexible Non-Refundable Booking rate, you will be able to make one (1) change to your booking directly with the property before your original arrival date.\nSuch changes may be to (i) change your booking dates.\n(ii) change the number of nights.\n(iii) change the number of guests.\nor (iv) change your room type.\nAny proposed change to be made to your booking will be strictly subject to the property\u2019s availability.\nWhere the booking price for the proposed new dates is higher than the original dates, the property will arrange directly with you to pay the difference.\nIf the booking price for the new date is less than the original date, no refund shall be given.\nOnce your amended booking is confirmed, the property will send you a confirmation email setting out the above information.</p>\n<p>3.4 On making a booking for a tour or experience, you will always be required to pay the total price of your tour or experience at the time of booking which We collect (in full or in part) for and on behalf of the travel services provider.\nCertain tours and experiences can only be booked on the non-refundable payment of the total price of your tour or experience at the time of booking (\u201cNon-Refundable Tour\u201d).\nNon-Refundable Tours will always be non-refundable unless the travel services provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.\nIt will be made clear in the terms and conditions applicable to Non-Refundable Tours that they are Non-Refundable Tours.\nAny cancellation of tours or experiences that are not Non-Refundable Tours will be refundable only if cancelled within the cancellation period stated in the terms and conditions applicable to such tour or experience.</p>\n<p>3.5 You may also be required to pay a flat booking fee for use of the Hostelworld Sites when a booking is made with a travel services provider.\nWhere We charge a booking fee, it is non-refundable in all circumstances.\nWe do not act as your agent and the booking fee is payable for use of the Hostelworld Sites and is separate from any deposit payable to the travel services provider.</p>\n<p>3.6 Unless either the Hostelworld booking terms and conditions displayed to you before you confirm your booking or the travel service provider\u2019s terms and conditions state otherwise, you will be responsible for paying of the balance of the cost of the booking made by you to the travel services provider on arrival, together with any other payments for any additional goods or services subsequently agreed with the travel services provider.\nYou will also be responsible for the payment of the travel services provider's service charges and taxes, pursuant to the terms and conditions of trade applied by such travel services provider, where applicable.</p>\n<p>3.7 You must use a credit card or debit card to guarantee a booking.\nBy making a booking with your credit card or debit card, you agree to accept the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of the travel services provider as set out in its terms and conditions.\nIn the event that you cancel your booking: (a) outside the permitted timeframe specified in the travel service provider\u2019s terms and conditions.\nor (b) in the case of Free Cancellation Bookings, the timeframe specified on the Hostelworld Site at the time of booking.\nor (c) you fail to arrive by your agreed accommodation check-in time (\u201cno-show\u201d),\nyou authorise the travel services provider to charge to your credit card or debit card, without further reference to you, an amount not exceeding the charge for one night's stay (in the case of accommodation) or such other amount as may be set out in the travel service provider's terms and conditions.\nPlease note that there will be no additional charges for cancellations or no-shows in respect of Non-Refundable Bookings, but you will not be refunded the cost of any part of your booking in such circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>3.8 Your no-show may result in the cancellation of your entire booking.\nAny amendments to your booking must be notified to and agreed with the travel services provider directly (but no refund of all or any part of the deposit will be made).\nPlease note it is not possible to amend Non-Refundable Bookings and you will not be refunded the cost of your Non-Refundable Booking if you cancel your booking or do not use the related accommodation booked.\nIn making a booking, it shall be your sole responsibility to disclose to the travel services provider any requirements or special facilities that you or a member of your party may need as a result of any medical conditions.</p>\n<p>3.9 When a booking is confirmed, We will issue the booking confirmation on behalf of the travel services provider for each booking, but We will not provide information about any charges for additional services.\nWe will endeavour to ensure that the booking confirmation includes details of all taxes charged by the travel services provider, in relation to which please see clause 12.9 below.\nWhere you make permissible changes to a Flexible Non-Refundable Booking, the travel services provider will issue the revised booking confirmation directly to you.\nWe strongly recommend you check and confirm with the travel services provider the precise terms and conditions upon which the travel services provider makes the reserved service available to you upon receipt of the booking confirmation.\nThe reference numbers included on the booking confirmation should be quoted in all enquiries, cancellation or modification of the booking.</p>\n<p>3.10 You do not have an automatic right to cancel any booking you make unless such rights are provided to you by the travel services provider under their specific terms and conditions as disclosed on the booking confirmation and detailed property description page at the time of booking.\nDeadlines for cancellation under a travel service provider\u2019s cancellation policy are normally at least 24 hours before your agreed check-in date, unless otherwise stated by the travel service provider.\nPlease cancel by accessing the cancellation function available on the Hostelworld Sites.\nFor details regarding the cancellation of Free Cancellation Bookings, please see below.</p>\n<p>3.11 If you choose the Standard Flexible Booking option when making your booking (where it is

subsequent bookings, you must have selected the Standard Flexible Booking option for those bookings in order for your deposit(s) to be protected and added back to your Hostelworld account as a voucher.\n(f) Vouchers only apply to deposits for accommodation bookings.\nit cannot be used in respect of other charges levied via the Hostelworld Sites - e.g.\nbooking fees or other purchases.\n(g)

deposits, including deposits paid through the Standard Flexible Booking option, will be non-refundable and the travel services provider will have the right to charge your credit card on the basis set

receive a refund of your deposit.\n(e) It is only possible to receive a refund of your deposit if you cancel your full booking (partial cancellations, such as cancellations of 1 night of a 2 night stay, will not result in a refund of any portion of your deposit).\n(f) For the avoidance of doubt, We refund your deposit on behalf of the relevant travel services provider as their agent.\nWe do not act on your behalf when processing refunds.\n</p>\n<p>Tour Bookings</p>\n<p>3.15 Where you make a tour or experience booking, the following provisions apply:\n(a) Your booking cannot be changed by you

cancellations will be communicated by Us to the tour/experience aggregator (e.g.\nViator) who will process the cancellation subject to the availability and agreement of the applicable travel service provider.\nHostelworld does not guarantee the success of any cancellation.\nYour right to a refund (if any) shall be governed by the cancellation terms of your booking.\nAll requests for modifications

you claim is fraudulent or otherwise disputed.\nChargebacks may happen for a variety of valid reasons but if you make a payment-card payment to Us in respect of a booking, and you later dispute this legitimate charge by raising a chargeback without merit, whether fraudulently or otherwise, then We may take steps to recover any charges resulting from such an unmerited chargeback from you

is a Cookie?\n<p>A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web cookie, or browser cookie, is usually a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser while a user is browsing a website.\nWhen the user browses the same website in the future, the data stored in the cookie can be retrieved by the website to notify the website of the user's previous activity.\nCookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember the state of the website or activity the user had taken in the past.\nThis can include clicking particular buttons, logging in, or a record of which pages were visited by the user.\n</p>\n<p>Other kinds of cookies perform essential functions in the modern Web.\nPerhaps most importantly, authentication cookies are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in under.\nWithout such a mechanism, the website would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate himself by logging-in.\n</p> Types of Cookies in Use\n<p>The following types of cookie are in use within Hostelworld systems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strictly necessary cookies</li>\n<li>Performance cookies</li>\n<li>Functionality cookies</li>\n<li>Targeting / Advertising cookies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These cookies are a mixture
