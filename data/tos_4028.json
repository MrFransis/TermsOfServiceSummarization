registering for your free trial, you agree that your debit/credit card will be pre-authorised for the subscription value (one per sign up attempt) to verify your identity, and to protect us from theft and fraud.\nYou understand that this may leave a shadow on your card for up to 10 days and these funds may not be available during this period.</p>\n<p>Please note: If using a pre-paid card, the funds

on 'cancellation' below.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nBilling&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nAs a subscriber to Boomerang, you agree that we are permitted to charge you a monthly subscription fee and any other charges that you may incur in connection with your use of Boomerang.\nThe subscription fee will be billed on the last day of your free trial and on each monthly renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel, and regardless of how much you use the service.\nWe will automatically charge your debit/credit card each month on or after the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your membership (usually your free trial's expiry date).</p>\n<p>We use the Visa and Mastercard \"Card Updater\" service.\nOn cancellation or expiry of a card, in most instances, the card providers automatically provide our Payment Provider, Sagepay, with the new card number.\nThis ensures you receive an uninterrupted service, as we can continue to process your subscriptions, without any action on your part.\nHowever, If your payment card changes and your account becomes suspended, you will be required to update your payment card.</p>\n<p>All fees and charges are non-refundable.\nWe may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email.\nIf you wish to use a different credit card or payment method, or if there is a change in your card validity or expiry date, you may edit payment details by clicking on \"My

a claim against you through the Small Claims Court.\nThere will be a minimum Claim charge of \u00a330.</p>\n<p>These costs will be added to the amount you owe.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nAutomatic renewals&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nYour Boomerang subscription will be automatically renewed on a monthly basis.\nFor your convenience, we will charge the monthly subscription fee to the debit/credit card that you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your account information subsequently).\nYour membership will automatically renew for successive monthly subscriptions, without prior notice to you, unless and until you cancel your membership or we terminate it.\nYou must cancel your membership before it renews in order to avoid billing of subscription fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nAccount changes&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nYou may upgrade or downgrade your Boomerang subscription as often as you like, within the 'My account' section of the Boomerang website.\nAny reduction in your monthly bill will take effect at the next billing period after any outstanding games have been returned to us.\nAny increase in your monthly bill resulting from an upgrade will take effect immediately, being pro-rated to the remainder of your billing period, and the increase may be charged immediately (without changing any subsequent billing dates).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nDelivery and return of Games&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nWe currently use the Royal Mail, first-class postage prepaid, to deliver and return the games you have selected to play.\nActual delivery times may vary for you depending on (i) our stock availability, (ii) your delivery address, (iii) when you make your selection and (iv) circumstances impacting delivery by the Royal Mail.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nYou agree to treat the games and their associated packaging with the utmost care at all times.\nYou agree that you may need to compensate Boomerang Video Ltd for any game lost or returned in an unacceptable condition (beyond reasonable wear and tear) - and that you allow Boomerang to charge such compensation to your debit/credit card.\nWe will notify you of any such charges.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You agree to report to Boomerang Video Ltd any possible loss or late delivery of a game to you within 7 days of receipt of the confirmation of game despatch email you will receive from Boomerang.\nYou agree to complete any paper work and fulfil any reasonable request to assist Boomerang Video Limited to obtain compensation for any lost game from Royal Mail.</p>\n<p>When games are reported lost, later than 14 days, our policy is to treat them as lost from when we are notified.\nYou understand that we will not refund any lost subscription or part subscription payments due to your delay in notifying us of a lost game.</p>\n<p>You agree to return only one title per envelope.\nThis ensures that if an envelope is lost in the postal system, only one game will be lost.</p>\n<p>While it is very rare for items to be lost in the postal system we recommend that you obtain a Certificate of Posting, on all games you return to us.</p>\n<p>This is not mandatory unless cancelling your membership, but enables us to resolve any lost game issues much more quickly.\nA Certificate of Posting can be obtained free of charge from any Post Office.</p>\n<p>Where a Certificate of Posting has been obtained for a returned game that is lost in the post, you agree to provide to Boomerang Video Ltd the relevant original Certificate of Posting, within 7 days of the loss being identified (retain a copy for your own records).\nOn receipt of this, we can then despatch your next rental.</p>\n<p>We recommend that you send your Certificate of Posting to us by recorded delivery or at least obtain another Certificate of Posting.</p>\n<p>You agree, where no Certificate of Posting is provided to us, and in order to help us recover some of the cost of this loss, that you will:</p>\n<p>Notify us after 7 days from posting, of this loss, and that for;<br>\nThe first lost returned game (without Certificate of Posting), you agree to remain with us for at least a further 3 months (6 months if Value 1 customer) as a full paying customer or allow us to charge you for the lost item.<br>\nFor the second and subsequent lost returned games (without Certificate of Posting), you agree to remain with us for at least a further 6 months (12 months for Value 1 customer) as a full paying customer (to be added to any remaining time for previous losses) or allow us to charge you for the lost item.<br>\nYou understand that Boomerang Video Ltd reserve the right to debit your debit/credit card for up to the full retail price of any lost game, if you fail to adhere to the above terms.\nWe will notify you of any such charges.</p>\n<p>You agree that we reserve the right to cancel your membership if it becomes apparent that, in our sole opinion, the postal service in your area is too unreliable, without refund of any subscription payments.</p>\n<p>Use of Games</p>\n<p>You agree that you will be responsible for any use of any games supplied by us to you and that any minor's use of any games will be restricted by you consistent with any applicable age classification applied to that game.</p>\n<p>Cancellation&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nAs noted above, you may cancel your subscription to Boomerang at anytime.\nCancellation requests must be via the website www.boomerangrentals.co.uk.&nbsp.\nTo cancel, you must log on and go to My Account, then click on the Cancel Icon.\nNo other method is acceptable and Boomerang Video Ltd will have no liability for a cancellation request sent by any other means.</p>\n<p>Immediately upon requesting cancellation, no further games will be dispatched to you.\nAll games must be returned before the cancellation will be confirmed.\nOnce all games have been returned, the cancellation will take effect immediately and a confirmation email will be sent to you.</p>\n<p>Failure to return games before your next billing date will result in the account remaining active and billing will continue.\nWe reserve the right to charge a replacement cost of up to the full retail price for any non returned games.</p>\n<p>To avoid problems, you MUST obtain a Certificate of Posting&nbsp.\nwhen you return our games to us.\nOur policy is to always charge for lost games following notification of cancellation where no proof of posting is provided.\nIf a proof of posting is provided you will not be charged.</p>\n<p>Please note we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial monthly subscription periods.</p>\n<p>Purchasing Games</p>\n<p>Prices and Payment</p>\n<p>The total cost of your order (UK pounds) will be the price of the products you order.\nAll these will be set out clearly in your Checkout before you submit your order.</p>\n<p>Prices, offers and products are subject to availability and may change before, but not after, we accept your order.\nIf an item becomes unavailable we may offer you an alternative.</p>\n<p>We accept payment by most major credit and debit cards, except American Express.\nPayment is deducted when you confirm your order.</p>\n<p>Restrictions - Age
