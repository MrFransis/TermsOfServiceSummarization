date: 08/11/2020\nAll services provided by Spry Servers, LLC (\"Spry Servers\") may be used for lawful purposes only.\nTransmission, storage or presentation of any information, data or material in violation of any United States federal, state or city law is prohibited.\nThis includes, but is not limited to: copyrighted material, material we judge to be threatening or obscene, or material protected by trade secret and other statute.\nThe subscriber agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Spry Servers, LLC from any claims resulting from the use of service which damages the subscriber or any other party.<br>\n<br>\nProhibited are sites that promote any illegal activity or present content that may be damaging to Spry Servers, LLC's servers, or any other server on the Internet.\nLinks to such materials are also prohibited.\n<strong>Examples of unacceptable content or links: </strong>(includes, but not limited to) pirated software, hacker programs or archives, warez sites and child pornography.\n<br>\n<br>\nNOTICE: IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS FOUND TO CONTAIN ILLEGAL ACTIVITY, ILLEGAL MP3 FILES, PIRATED SOFTWARE, HACKER PROGRAMS, WAREZ PROGRAMS, VIRUSES OR ANY OTHER ILLEGAL FILES/CONTENT, YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE TERMINATED IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT NOTICE, AND A $250.00 CANCELLATION FEE WILL APPLY.\nADDITIONALLY, SPRY SERVERS, LLC WILL NOTIFY THE PROPER AUTHORITIES OF YOUR ACTIONS.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Spry Servers, LLC's Responsibilities</strong>\n<br>Spry Servers agrees to furnish services, which are paid for in advance by the client, to the client, subject to complete compliance with the AUP and these Terms of Service.\nSpry Servers reserves the right to refuse services to any potential client and/or to deny renewal of Services to any existing client, at the sole discretion of Spry Servers.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Traffic Usage (Bandwidth)</strong>\n<br>All account plans which do come with a predetermined amount of traffic allowance are monitored, and will be charged an overage fee if that allowance is exceeded.\nAn invoice will be generated each month you exceed your limits.\n<br>\n<br>Traffic overage fees are determined by the following fee schedule:\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Dedicated Servers:</strong> $8/TB (Terabyte)\n<br>\n<strong>Colocation (Qty based billing):</strong> $8/TB (Terabyte)\n<br>\n<strong>Colocation (95% based billing):</strong> $5/Mbps (Megabits per second)\n<br>\n<strong>Virtual Private Servers (VPS):</strong> $0.05/GB (Gigabyte)\n<br>\n<strong>Shared Hosting (Includes Reseller, WordPress, etc):</strong> $0.10/GB (Gigabyte)\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Excess Storage Usage (Shared Hosting - Includes Reseller, WordPress, etc)</strong>\n<br>If your hosting plan comes with a predetermined maximum storage size, we will not suspend your account from over use.\nWe will, however, charge for overages at $0.50 for each gigabyte used over the allowed amount.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>IRC</strong>\n<br>\nWe currently do not allow IRC or IRC bots to be operated on our servers.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Server Abuse</strong>\n<br>\nAny attempt to undermine or cause harm to a server or customer of Spry Servers, LLC is strictly prohibited.\nAs our customer you are responsible for all your accounts.\nShould you violate the Terms of Services outlined within, your account will be cancelled without chance of refund.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Refusal of Service</strong>\n<br>\nWe reserve the right to refuse, cancel or suspend service, at our sole discretion.\n<br>\nAll sub-networks, distributive hosting sites and dedicated servers of Spry Servers, LLC must adhere to the above policies, with the exception of system resources in respect to dedicated servers.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Billing</strong>\n<br>\nBy the Account Activation Date of each month (or other agreed billing term), Spry Servers, LLC shall either:\n<br>\n<br>\n(1) debit the client's credit card (when such information has been provided by the client).\nor\n<br>\n(2) deliver, by e-mail an invoice in accordance with the applicable Service Fees for services rendered for the current billing period.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhen an invoice is delivered to the client, payment shall be remitted to Spry Servers, LLC by no later than the specified payment due date.\nSpry Servers, LLC shall be entitled to immediately terminate this agreement for client's failure to make timely payments.\nYou will be provided with an invoice on either a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis.\nAll credit cards, if on file, will be billed automatically within 15 days following the invoice date.\nIt is the client's responsibility to ensure that they have sufficient credit to cover this transaction.\nIn the event that there is insufficient credit, we will send an e-mail notification, at which point we will need to be provided with another credit card account number within 24 hours.\nIf we do not receive a response within 24 hours, the account, and all accounts under that account plan, will be suspended.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Service Fees</strong>\n<br>\nCertain services carry a setup fee charged by Spry Servers, LLC to client, which must be paid by client in order to have use of said services.\nIf client terminates this agreement, client shall be responsible for any and all outstanding fees owed to Spry Servers, LLC and agrees to pay any and all fees incurred by client.\nBecause the services are provided on a monthly basis, the client will be responsible for service fees incurred each month, regardless of when client provides notice of termination.\nThus, for example, if the client provides notice of termination on the 15th day of a particular month, the client will be responsible for service fees for the entire month, and such fees will not be pro-rated or refunded.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Free Domain Names</strong>\n<br>\nFree domain registration for one domain, for a term of one year, with the purchase of any shared web hosting subscription of one year or more.\nThis offer is subject to change or discontinuation with or without notice.\nDomain must be one of the following TLDs to qualify (.com .net .info.\norg .biz) As your term nears its end, domain renewals will be charged the then market rate for the TLD of the selected domain.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Free SSL Certificate</strong>\n<br>\nCertain plans come with SSL certificates at no additional charge.\nIf you receive an SSL certificate with your hosting plan, you own this certificate for the duration of your hosting account life.\nWe will renew the certificate for you when the time comes at no additional charge.\nHowever, if you would like an upgraded certificate, you will need to purchase this additionally.\n(ie.\nWildcard/Organization Validated/EV Certificates) If you elect to upgrade, we will not renew the free certificate.\nIf you have a free SSL certificate and decide to switch to another hosting provider, the SSL certificate is non-transferable and will be revoked.\nIf the SSL certificate was purchased as an upgrade, it is yours to keep/transfer.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Money Back Guarantee</strong>\n<br>\nWe offer a 30 day money back guarantee on many items.\nIf you are not satisfied with your purchase for any reason, on any shared hosting product, SSL certificate, or reseller hosting account, you may request a full refund within 30 (thirty) days of your original purchase.\nYour refund will be processed within 1-2 weeks, and credited back to your method of payment automatically.\nWe are not responsible for bank holds.\nDomain name registrations and dedicated servers are non-refundable.\nIf you purchase a plan that comes with a free domain name, you will receive a credit for the hosting plan minus the cost of said domain name at the current applicable market rate.\nIf you request a refund, but any IPs we have assigned your account have been blacklisted in any database, you will not be refunded.\nCryptocurrency payments are excluded from the money back guarantee policy.\nAll sales are final if you paid with cryptocurrency.\nWhen PayPal is used as a payment method, refunds will be given, less any PayPal transaction fees.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Duplicate Payments/PayPal Subscriptions</strong>\n<br>\nIt is the customer's responsibility to manage their PayPal subscription.\nIf a customer signs up with a subscription, then pays their invoice manually the next month without cancelling the subscription, a duplicate payment will be made.\nIn these scenarios, we will not refund payment to the customer's PayPal account.\nIf customer has made an accidental payment/overpayment for any reason, any and all refund due will be credited to the customer's Spry Servers balance.\nThe balance is non-transferrable and has no cash value outside of purchasing products and services from Spry Servers.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Refunds</strong>\n<br>\nWe do not offer refunds on products and services not explicitly defined within our money back guarantee.\nWe reserve the right to decline repetitive refund requests for similar products or services at our discretion.\nAdditionally, abuse of our refund policy may result in you and/or your company being reported to FraudRecord.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Chargebacks</strong>\n<br>\nAny and all charge disputes must be reported directly to Spry Servers within thirty (30) days of the date which the charge originally occurred.\nIf a charge which is deemed valid by Spry Servers, and validated by our Terms of Service or AUP, is disputed to a financial institution by performing a charge-back, you will be notified by e-mail.\nIf the chargeback was accidental (\"friendly fraud\"), you must notify the issuing bank (request to reverse chargeback) and Spry Servers, LLC no later than 7 calendar days after you receive communication from us that a chargeback has been initiated.\nIf we do not hear from you within 7 calendar days, we will assume it was genuine fraud or abuse of your cardholder agreement.\nYour service will be terminated and your account will be closed.\nIf you wish to re-open your account, the client agrees to pay (with a different payment method), an 'Administrative Fee' of $250 in addition to original amount of funds which were reclaimed.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Non-Payment/Late Fees/Service Interruption</strong>\n<br>\nAccounts, unless otherwise explicitly defined, will be deactivated after 2 days from the invoice due date if payment is not received.\nWe realize everyone falls on hard financial times.\nIf you need extra time, please let us know so we can work out a payment arrangement.\nAny account deactivated due to non-payment will be subject to a late fee of $10.00 or 10% of the total amount in arrears (whichever amount is greater, up to the maximum allowed by law).\n(typically billed on the following cycle) Data stored on a client\u2019s services will not be available to the client until re-connection is established or alternative arrangements are made to the sole satisfaction of Spry Servers, LLC.\nFor dedicated and cloud servers, suspension/deactivation will occur within (2) days of invoice due date.\nClients deactivated for non-payment or charge-back are subject to their data being destroyed seven (5) days from invoice due date for dedicated/cloud servers and (7) days from suspension/charge-back date for shared hosting or reseller accounts.\nSpry Servers, LLC is not responsible for data integrity, regardless of circumstance.\nSpry Servers, LLC strongly recommends keeping up to date and off network backups to protect against data loss.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Cancellation Refunds</strong>\n<br>\nWe DO NOT refund partial payment term fees to any accounts.\nNotice of at least 24 hours before your invoice due date must be given for service cancellation.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Account Balances/Pre-paid Funds</strong>\n<br>\nPre-paid account balances are non-transferrable and have no cash value outside of purchasing products and services from Spry Servers.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Refusal of Service</strong>\n<br>\nWe reserve the right to refuse, cancel or suspend service, at our sole discretion.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>\n<br>\nSpry Servers, LLC shall not be responsible for any claimed damages, including incidental and consequential damages, which may arise from Spry Servers, LLC's servers going off-line or being unavailable for any reason whatsoever.\nFurthermore, Spry Servers, LLC shall

other Internet-related services, Spry Servers, LLC offers its customer (also known as \u201cSubscribers\u201d) and their customers and users the means to acquire and disseminate a wealth of public, private, commercial and non-commercial information.\nSpry Servers, LLC respects that the internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information.\nHowever, when there are competing interests at issue, Spry Servers, LLC reserves the right to take certain preventive or corrective actions.\nIn order to protect these competing interests, Spry Servers, LLC has developed an <strong>Acceptable Use Policy (\u201cAUP\u201d)</strong>, which supplements and explains certain terms of each customer\u2019s respective service agreement, and is intended as a guide to the customer\u2019s rights and obligations when using Spry Servers, LLC\u2019 services.\nThis AUP will be revised from time to time.\n<br>\n<br>You will be held responsible for all actions performed by your account whether done by you or by others!

Policy (this \u201cAUP\u201d), including SPAM, and all disconnect and reconnect fees associated with violations.\n<br>\n<br>One important aspect of the internet is that no one party owns or controls it.\nThis fact accounts for much of the internet\u2019s openness and value, but it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who use it, both in the information they acquire and in the information they disseminate to others.\nWhen subscribers obtain information through the Internet, they must keep in mind that Spry Servers, LLC cannot monitor, verify, warrant or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information they acquire.\nFor this reason, the subscriber must exercise his or her best judgment in relying on information obtained from the internet, and

to do so, Spry Servers, LLC cannot accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers or the general public, resulting from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive or illegal internet communications.\n<br>\n<br>The Primary Purpose of Spry Servers is to provide our clients with the resources necessary to bring their internet services online in a reliable, lightning fast, high availability environment which responds quickly to each clients' individual needs.\n<br>\n<br>The client is ultimately responsible for individual server security.\nSpry Servers disclaims all liability for server content.\n<br>\n<br>When subscribers disseminate information from the internet, they must keep in mind that Spry Servers, LLC does not review, edit, censor or take responsibility for any information its subscribers may create.\nWhen users place information on the internet, they have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation and other harmful speech.\nAlso, because the information created is carried over Spry Servers, LLC's network and may reach a large number of people, including both subscribers and non-subscribers of Spry Servers, LLC.\nSubscribers\u2019 postings to the Internet may affect other subscribers and may affect Spry Servers, LLC\u2019s goodwill, business, reputation or operations.\nFor these reasons, subscribers will

to ensure that the comply with Spry Servers, LLC\u2019 policy or applicable law.\nHowever, when Spry Servers, LLC becomes aware of harmful activities, it may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited to, removal of information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to the Internet, or any other action deemed appropriate by Spry Servers, LLC.\n<br>\n<br>Spry Servers, LLC is also aware that many of its subscribers are themselves providers of internet services, and that information

subscribers who offer internet services to monitor or censor transmissions or web sites created by customers of its subscribers.\nSpry Servers, LLC reserves the right to directly take action against a customer of its subscribers.\nAlso, Spry Servers, LLC may take action against the Spry Servers, LLC\u2019s subscriber because of activities of a customer of the subscriber, even though the action may affect other customers of the subscriber.\nSimilarly, Spry Servers, LLC anticipates that subscribers who offer internet services will cooperate with Spry Servers, LLC in any corrective or preventive action that Spry Servers, LLC deems necessary.\nFailure to cooperate with such corrective or preventive measures is a violation of Spry Servers, LLC\u2019s policy.\n<br>\n<br>Spry Servers, LLC will not intentionally monitor private electronic mail messages sent or receive by its subscribers, unless required to do so by law, governmental authority or when public safety is at stake.\nSpry Servers, LLC may, however, monitor its service electronically to determine that its facilities are operating satisfactorily.\nAlso, Spry Servers, LLC may disclose information, including, but not limited to, information concerning a subscriber, a transmission made using our network, or a web site, in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute, regulation or governmental request.\nSpry Servers, LLC assumes no obligation to inform the subscriber that subscriber information has been provided and, in some cases, may be prohibited by law from giving such notice.\nFinally, Spry Servers, LLC may disclose subscriber information or information transmitted over its network where necessary to protect Spry Servers, LLC and others from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary to the proper operation of the system.\nHowever, Spry Servers, LLC will never sell information to other services or outside companies.\n<br>\n<br>Spry Servers, LLC expects that its subscribers who provide Internet services to others will comply fully with all applicable laws concerning the privacy of online communications.\nA subscriber\u2019s failure to comply with those laws will violate Spry Servers, LLC policy.\nFinally, Spry Servers, LLC wishes to emphasize that, in signing the Service Agreement, subscribers indemnify Spry Servers, LLC for any violation of the Service Agreement, law or Spry Servers, LLC policy resulting in loss to Spry Servers, LLC or the bringing of any claim against Spry Servers, LLC by any third party.\nThis means that, if Spry Servers, LLC is sued because of a subscriber\u2019s or customer of a subscriber\u2019s activity, the subscriber will be responsible for payment of any damages awarded against Spry Servers, LLC, plus costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees.\n<br>\n<br>We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying the obligations of Internet users, including Spry Servers, LLC and its subscribers, as responsible members of the Internet.\nAny complaints about a subscriber\u2019s violation of this AUP should be sent to abuse@spryservers.net.<br>\n<p>CONTACT US</p>\n<ul>\n<li> +1 844-799-HOST</li>\n<li> sales@spryservers.net

FOR ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES.</strong>\n<br>\nThis Registration Agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) sets forth the terms and conditions of your use of domain name registration and related services (\u201cServices\u201d).\nIn this Agreement \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d refer to you and the registrant listed in the WHOIS contact information for the domain name.\n\u201cWe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to the registrars listed at the bottom of this document, any one of which will be the registrar for your domain name and all of which share common ownership, common terms and conditions, and a shared Services infrastructure.\nTo determine which registrar your domain name is registered with, perform a WHOIS lookup at http://www.uwhois.com.\nYou obtain the Services through your primary service provider, with whom we have a wholesale relationship (your \u201cPrimary Service Provider\u201d).\nYour relationship with your Primary Service Provider may be governed by additional terms, as you and your Primary Service Provider may agree.\n\u201cWe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d does not include your Primary Service Provider, except when specifically mentioned or unless your Primary Service Provider is one of us (i.e., if your Primary Service Provider is also one of the registrars listed at the bottom of this document)).\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>YOUR AGREEMENT: By using the Services, you agree to all terms and conditions of this Agreement, the UDRP (defined below), the URS (defined below), and any rules, policies, or agreements published in association with specific Services and/or which may be adopted or enforced by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\u201cICANN\u201d), any registry, or governments.</li>\n<li>CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT: This Agreement may change over time, either through amendments by us, changes to ICANN policy or applicable law which may or may not be reflected in the text of this Agreement, or otherwise.\nBefore any material changes to this Agreement become binding on you (other than changes resulting from a change in ICANN policy or applicable law), we will notify you of such changes by, for example, sending email to you at your email address of record.\nIf, as a result of such a change, you no longer agree with the terms of this Agreement, your exclusive remedies are (a) to transfer your domain name registration services to another registrar, or (b) to cancel your Services, including domain name registration services, with us.\nYour continued use of the Services following notification of a change in this Agreement indicates your consent to the changes.\nUnless otherwise specified by us, any such change binds you: (1) thirty (30) days after we notify you of the change, or (2) immediately if such change is a result of a new or amended ICANN policy or applicable law.</li>\n<li>REGISTRANT RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES: ICANN has developed, in consultation with registrars, a webpage that identifies important registrant rights and responsibilities.\nThe document provides a \u201cplain language\u201d summary of terms related to Registrant Rights and Responsibilities as set out in the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA), for posting on registrar websites.\nWhile some of the terms included do not specifically refer to registrants, those terms are included because of the potential import to understanding registrar/registrant relations.\nThe document also summarizes registrant rights and responsibilities that arise within ICANN Consensus Policies and specifications, as those policies and specifications are incorporated into the RAA.\nThe summarization of terms within this document do not override or replace the terms set forth in the RAA or within those specifications or policy.\nPlease review these important Registrant Rights and Responsibilities.</li>\n<li>YOUR ACCOUNT: You must create an account to use the Services (\u201cAccount\u201d).\nYour Account is typically managed and/or provided by your Primary Service Provider.\nYou are solely responsible for maintaining, securing, updating, and keeping strictly confidential all login IDs and passwords, and for all access to and use of your Account by you or any third party.\n<ol>\n<li>ACCOUNT CONTACT INFORMATION AND DOMAIN NAME WHOIS INFORMATION:\n<ol>\n<li>You must provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you with respect to your Account information and with respect to the WHOIS information for your domain name(s).\nWithin seven (7) days of any change to such information, you must update such information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate.\nYou must submit the following with respect to you, the administrative, technical, and billing contacts for your domain name registration(s) and other Services: name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available, fax number.\nThe type of information you are required to provide may change and you must provide such information and keep your Account information current.\nNot providing requested information may prevent you from obtaining all Services.</li>\n<li>You may provide information regarding the name-servers assigned to your domain name(s) and, if we are providing name-server services to you, the DNS settings for the domain name.\nIf you do not provide complete name-server information, or if you purchase \u201cName Only\u201d Services, we may supply this information (and point your domain name to a website of our choosing) until such time as you elect to supply the name-server information or until such time as you elect to upgrade from \u201cName Only\u201d Services.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THE ACCOUNT AND WHOIS CONTACT INFORMATION:\n<ol>\n<li>If, in obtaining Services, you provide information about or on behalf of a third party, you represent and warrant that you have (a) provided notice to that third party of the disclosure and use of that party\u2019s information as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) obtained the third party\u2019s express written consent to the disclosure and use of that party\u2019s information as set forth in this Agreement.</li>\n<li>You represent and warrant that the statements in your application are true and that no Services are being procured for any unlawful or abusive purpose, including but not limited to the infringement of any intellectual property right or other right.\nthe

Services.\ncounterfeiting.\nor any other activity in violation of any laws, rules, or regulations (the \u201cIllegal Uses\u201d).\nProviding inaccurate or unreliable information, failing to update information within seven (7) days of any change, engaging in any Illegal Uses, or failing to respond for over fifteen (15) days to inquiries by us concerning the accuracy of Account and WHOIS contact information will constitute an incurable material breach of this Agreement and be a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the Services.</li>\n<li>You are responsible for regularly monitoring email sent to the email address in your Account.\nYou may lose your rights to the domain name(s) or your right to receive the Services if you do not respond appropriately and timely to an email sent in conjunction therewith.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>ACCESSING YOUR ACCOUNT:\n<ol>\n<li>In order to change any of your Account or domain name WHOIS information, you must access your Account with your Primary Service Provider, or your Account with us.\nIt is your duty to safeguard your Account login identifier and password from any unauthorized use.\nAny person in possession of your Account login identifier and password will have both the ability and your authorization to modify your Account and domain name information, initiate transfers of your domain name(s) to other registrars, initiate registrant changes to your domain names which may terminate your rights to use such domain name(s), update DNS changes to your domain name(s) which may result in changes to the content associated with your domain name(s) and take other actions which may affect or terminate your rights and access to your domain name(s) and/or the Services.</li>\n<li>We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information and such reasonable precautions include procedures for releasing Account access information to parties who claim to have lost Account access information.\nIf we take reasonable precautions in relation thereto, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE IF SUCH REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS DO NOT PREVENT THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD AND, EVEN IF WE FAIL TO TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS, OUR LIABILITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION FOUND IN PARAGRAPH 13 BELOW IN THIS AGREEMENT.</li>\n<li>If you contact us alleging that a third party has unauthorized access to your Account or domain names, we may charge you administrative fees, currently set at fifty dollars ($50) per hour, for our time spent in relation to the matter, regardless of whether or not we return control over the Account and/or domain name(s) to you.\nYou will indemnify us for any reasonable attorneys\u2019 Fees and costs we may incur in relation to the matter, even if those fees and costs accrue as a result of defending an action, or responding to a threat of an action, initiated by You or a third party.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>SHARING OF WHOIS INFORMATION:\n<ol>\n<li>We will make available the domain name registration information you provide or that we otherwise maintain to the following parties: ICANN, any ICANN-authorized escrow service, the registry administrator(s), and to other third parties as ICANN and applicable laws may require or permit (including through web-based and other on-line WHOIS lookup systems), whether during or after the term of your domain name registration services of the domain name.\nYou irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from such disclosure or use of such information.\nWe may make publicly available, or directly available to third parties, some, or all, of the information you provide, for purposes of inspection (such as through our WHOIS service) or for targeted marketing and other purposes as required or permitted by applicable laws, including by way of bulk WHOIS data access provided to third parties who enter into a bulk WHOIS data access agreement with us.</li>\n<li>ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that we may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available.\nInformation regarding ICANN\u2019s guidelines and requirements regarding WHOIS can be found at http://www.icann.org/registrars/wmrp.htm, http://www.icann.org/registrars/wdrp.htm, and elsewhere on the ICANN website at http://www.icann.org/.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>OUR SERVICES:\n<ol>\n<li>DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION.\n<ol>\n<li>We are accredited registrars with ICANN for generic top level domain names (\u201cgTLDs\u201d) (such as .com, .net, .org, etc.).\nICANN oversees registrations and other aspects of the gTLDs.\nWe also are registrars for a variety of country code top level domain names (\u201cccTLDs\u201d) (such as .co.uk, .de, etc.).\nFor a partial list of registry administrators and for more information on gTLDs, see http://www.icann.org/tlds/.Domain name registrations are not effective until the registry administrator puts them into effect.\nDomain name registrations are only for limited terms which end on the expiration date.\nFor domain names which are created as a new registration out of the pool of available domain names, the term begins on the date the domain name registration is acknowledged by the applicable registry.\nFor domain name registrations which were not returned to the pool of available domain names, the term begins on the date the previous registrant\u2019s domain name registration was acknowledged by the applicable registry.</li>\n<li>We and your Primary Service Provider are not liable or responsible in any way for any errors, omissions or any other actions by the registry administrator, including those arising out of or related to a request to register, renew, modify the settings for, or transfer of a domain name registration.\nYou acknowledge that domain name registration is a service, domain name registrations do not exist independently from services provided pursuant to this or a similar registration agreement with a registrar, domain name registration services do not create a property interest and you have no such property interest in any domain name(s) which you may register with us.</li>\n<li>If you submit an application for pre-registration of a domain name, we do not guarantee that the domain name will be secured for you, or that you will have immediate access to the domain name if secured.\nIn the event two (2) or more pre-registration applications are received for the same domain name and the domain name is secured, all applicants will be invited to a private auction to decide who gets the domain name.\nIf you are such an applicant and wish to participate in the auction, you must first acknowledge any trademark claims notice that is shown to you and agree to any additional terms and conditions which may be applicable.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>AFTER MARKET DOMAIN NAMES:\n<ol>\n<li>We offer for sale domain names that are registered to third parties (also known as aftermarket domain names) in a variety of top level domain names (\u201cAfter Market Domain Name(s)\u201d).\nAll After Market Domain Name registrations are offered on a first come, first served basis.\nIf you are the first to complete an After Market Domain Name registration application for a particular domain name, including payment of the purchase price we designate, we will initiate a transfer of the relevant After Market Domain Name to your Account.\nIf the After Market Domain Name is at another domain registrar at the time of your purchase, we will transfer your purchased After Market Domain Name to us at no cost to you and will add one year to the existing registration period.\nIf the After Market Domain Name is already located with us as the domain registrar at the time of your purchase and it has ninety (90) days or less from the date of your purchase before expiration, we will renew your After Market Domain for you for free.\nIf the After Market Domain Name is already located with us as the domain registrar at the time of your purchase and it has ninety-one (91) days or more before expiration, you are responsible for all renewal fees.\nAny subsequent renewals of the After Market Domain Name will be charged at the then-current renewal fee.\nOnce you submit your order for an After Market Domain Name, you have entered into a valid, binding and enforceable contract to pay the designated purchase price for the After Market Domain Name.\nBecause we are selling After Market Domain Names initially registered to third parties, we have no control and make no representations regarding the accuracy or legality of domain names advertised, the accuracy or legality of any domain name listing, or the right and the ability of the third party seller to transfer the After Market Domain Name or complete the transaction.\nWe do not control whether or not third party sellers will complete a transaction.\nWe reserve the right to reject or cancel your After Market Domain Name registration for any reason including, but not limited to, any pricing errors.\nIn the event your After Market Domain Name registration is rejected or cancelled by us, for any reason, we will refund in full the amount of the purchase price for the After Market Domain Name as your sole remedy.</li>\n<li>Once the After Market Domain Name is transferred into your Account, such After Market Domain Name may not be transferred away from us to another registrar during the first sixty (60) days following the transfer, during which time the After Market Domain Name may be placed on transfer lock.\nAll of your obligations under this Agreement which apply to the registration or renewal of domain name(s) created by you apply to any After Market Domain Name(s) acquired by you, including but not limited to prohibition against any Illegal Uses.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>NOT INCLUDED IN THE SERVICES:\n<ol>\n<li>We are not responsible to determine whether the domain name(s) you select, or the use you or others make of the domain name(s), or other use of the Services, infringes legal rights of others.\nIt is your responsibility to know whether or not the domain name(s) you select or use or allow others to use infringe legal rights of others.</li>\n<li>We might be ordered by a court or arbitrator to cancel, modify, or transfer your domain name.\nit is your responsibility to list accurate contact information in association with your Account and to communicate with litigants, potential litigants, and governmental authorities.\nIt is not our responsibility to forward court orders or other communications to you.\nOur policy is to comply with court orders from courts of competent jurisdiction as well as UDRP and URS Panel decisions.\nIf you contact us informing us that you are contesting a court order from a court of competent jurisdiction, we may, but are not obligated to, place a transfer lock on the domain name pending the outcome of the dispute.\nIf you contact us informing us that you are contesting an adverse UDRP or URS Panel decision, your time limits and procedures to do so are subject to the requirements set forth in the UDRP or URS.\nWe will not delay implementation of a UDRP or URS Panel decision based solely on your informing us that you intend to contest the decision.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>USE OF FREE SERVICES:\n<ol>\n<li>In consideration for providing additional optional Services for which we do not charge an additional fee, including, but not limited to, free trials, URL forwarding, email forwarding, free parking page, free website hosting, free email services, or other free services which we may introduce from time to time (\u201cFree Services\u201d), we may display advertising in conjunction therewith through the use of pop-up or pop-under browser windows, banner advertisements, audio or video streams, appendices to emails, or any other advertising means, and we may aggregate for our own use, related usage data by means of cookies and other similar means.\nYou will not be entitled to any of the proceeds we may earn as a result of such advertising.\nWe may discontinue any Free Services at any time with or without providing you prior notice.</li>\n<li>From time to time we may provide you with free or low-cost domain name(s) registration services (\u201cPromotional Name(s)\u201d).\nIf we do so, the services for the Promotional Name(s) will be placed in the same Account as your other domain name(s) and you will be listed as the registrant, though we may point the Promotional Name to IP address(es) of our choosing.\nIf you want to assume control over the services provided to the Promotional Name, including the right to transfer or push the Promotional Name service to other registrars or other Accounts or the ability to control the DNS settings for the Promotional Name, you must pay the promotional registration fee or renewal fee, if any, and the terms of this Agreement will apply to such Promotional Name(s).\nIf you do not want the Promotional Name services, you may request that you be removed as the registrant of such Promotional Names and we may be listed as the domain name registrant or we may delete such domain names or make them available to others.\nFor any domain name services, including these Promotional Names, for which you are listed as registrant but for which you do not pay the registration or renewal fee, we may assign name-servers to the domain name and point the domain name to IP address(es) designated by us until the registration or renewal fee is paid.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>SERVICES PROVIDED AT WILL.\nTERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF SERVICES:\n<ol>\n<li>We and your Primary Service Provider may reject your domain name registration application or elect to discontinue providing Services to you for any reason within thirty (30) days of a Service initiation or a Service renewal.\nOutside of this period, we and your Primary Service Provider may terminate or suspend the Services at any time for cause, which, without limitation, includes (i) registration of prohibited domain name(s), (ii) abuse of the Services, (iii) payment irregularities, (iv) allegations of illegal conduct or infringement of any third party intellectual property right or other right, (v) failure to keep your Account or WHOIS information accurate and up to date, (vi) failure to respond to inquiries from us for over fifteen (15) calendar days, or (vii) if your use of the Services involves us in a violation or alleged violation of any third party\u2019s rights or acceptable use policies, including but not limited to the transmission of unsolicited email or the violation or alleged violation of any intellectual property right or other right.\nNo fee refund will be made when there is a suspension or termination of Services for cause.</li>\n<li>At any time and for any reason, we may terminate the Services thirty (30) days after we send notice of termination via mail or email, at our option, to the WHOIS contact information provided in association with your domain name registration.\nFollowing notice of termination other than for cause, you must transfer your domain name within such thirty (30) day notice period or risk that we may delete your domain name, transfer the registration services associated with your domain name to ourselves or a third party, or suspend or modify Services related to your domain name.\nIf we terminate Services for a reason other than cause, we will provide a pro-rata refund of your fees.</li>\n<li>If we terminate or suspend the Services provided to you under this Agreement, we may then, at our option, make either ourselves or a third party the beneficiary of Services which are substantially similar to those which were previously provided to you.\nIf we have grounds to terminate or suspend Services with respect to one domain name or in relation to other Services provided through your Account, we may terminate or suspend all Services provided through your Account.</li>\n<li>Your registration of a domain name is subject to suspension, cancellation or transfer by any ICANN procedure now in affect or which may come into effect at a later date, by any registrar or registry administrator procedures approved by an ICANN-adopted policy or any policy adopted by any ccTLD registry or governing body, to correct mistakes by us, another registrar or the registry administrator in administering the domain name or for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name or as a result of any government decree, rule, law or regulation.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>FEES: You agree to pay, prior to the effectiveness of the desired Services, the applicable Service fees set forth on the Pricing Page or otherwise communicated to you.\nIn the event any of the fees for Services change, we will use reasonable efforts to give you thirty (30) days prior notice of such changes on the Pricing Page or by other reasonable means.\nPlease check the Pricing Page often for any changes to our Services fees.\nAll fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your then current registration term, unless this Agreement specifically provides for a refund.\nAt our option, we may require that you pay fees through a particular payment means (such as by credit card or by wire transfer) or that you change from one payment provider to another.</li>\n<li>PAYMENT ISSUES: In the event of a charge back by a credit card company (or similar action by another payment provider allowed by us) in connection with your payment of fees for any Services, we and/or your Primary Service Provider may suspend access to any and all Accounts you have with us and/or your Primary Service Provider and all interests in and use of any domain name registration services, website hosting, and/or email services, including all data hosted on our systems and/or on the systems of your Primary Service Provider may be assumed by us or your Primary Service Provider, as the case may be, or may be terminated.\nWe may reinstate your rights to and control over these Services solely at our discretion, and subject to our receipt of the unpaid fees and our then-current reinstatement fee set forth on the Pricing Page or otherwise communicated to you.\nReinstatement of Services by your Primary Service Provider may be according to the terms between you and your Primary Service Provider relating to reinstatement.\nIf you have an issue with credit card or other payment charges, you should contact your Primary Service Provider, first, and us, second, regarding the issue before you contact your credit card or other payment process company to request a charge back or reversal of the charges.</li>\n<li>EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL OF SERVICES: It is your responsibility to keep your own records and to maintain your own reminders regarding when your domain name registration or other Services are set to expire.\nWith respect to domain name registration services, we and/or your Primary Service Provider will email a renewal notification approximately one (1) month and approximately one (1) week prior to each such domain name\u2019s expiration.\nIn addition, if a domain name is not renewed, we and/or your Primary Service Provider will email an additional renewal notification within five (5) days after the expiration of such domain name\u2019s registration.\nAll renewal notifications will be sent to primary contact for the Account associated with the domain name registration.\nIt is your responsibility to maintain current and accurate credit card information should any Services be placed on \u201cauto-renew.\u201d We and/or your Primary Service Provider will notify you when renewal fees are due.\nShould these fees go unpaid, your Services will expire or be cancelled.\nPayment must be made by credit card or such other method as we may allow or require from time to time.\nIf you select automatic renewal of the Services, we may attempt to renew the Services a reasonable time before expiration, provided your credit card or other billing information is available and up to date.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your billing information up to date and we are not required to, but may, contact you to update this information in the event that an attempted transaction is not processed successfully.\nPlease note: for certain top level domain names, the automatic renewal option is not available.</li>\n<li>EXPIRATION OF A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION: Immediately after the expiration of the term of domain name registration services and before deletion of the domain name in the applicable registry\u2019s database, we may direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) designated by us, including, without limitation, to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine that may display advertisements, and we may either leave your WHOIS information intact or we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.\n<ol>\n<li>Reactivation Period Process.\nFor a period of approximately thirty (30) days after expiration of the term of domain name registration services, we may provide a procedure by which expired domain name registration services may be renewed.\nWe may, but are not obligated to, offer this process, called the \u201creactivation period.\u201d You assume all risks and all consequences if you wait until close to or after the expiration of the original term of domain name registration services to attempt to renew the domain name registration services.\nWe may, in our sole discretion, choose not to offer a reactivation period and we shall not be liable therefore.\nThe reactivation period renewal process, if any, may involve additional fees which we and your Primary Service Provider may determine.\nWe may make expired domain name services(s) available to third parties, we may auction off the rights to expired domain name services (the auction beginning close to the end or after the end of the reactivation period), and/or expired domain name registration services may be re-registered to any party at any time.</li>\n<li>After the reactivation period, if any, we may:\n<ol>\n<li>Discontinue the domain name registration services at any time thereafter without notice.\nIn which case, certain registry administrators may provide procedures by which discontinued domain name registration services may nonetheless be renewed.\nWe will participate in this process, typically called the \u201cRedemption Grace Period\u201d (\u201cRGP\u201d), for each gTLD registry administrator that provides it.\nWe may, in our sole discretion, choose not to participate in the RGP process with respect to any or all of your ccTLD domain name registration services and we shall not be liable therefore.\nIf available, RGP typically ends between thirty (30) and forty-two (42) days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services.\nThe current RGP fee varies and does not include any registration fees that may also be due.\nWe are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being discontinued.\nor</li>\n<li>Pay the registry\u2019s registration fee or otherwise provide for the registration services to be continued.\nIn which case, we may then set the name-servers and the DNS settings for the domain name services, we may set the DNS to point to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host parking page(s) or a commercial search engine that may display paid advertisements, and we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.\nWe do not have to pay you any of the proceeds we may earn as a result.\nWe are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being continued.\nThe domain name will be designated as being in the extended redemption grace period (\u201cERGP\u201d), and you will be allowed to assume, during the first 120 days of the then extant registration term, complete management of the domain name services, including the right to control the DNS settings, provided that you pay the ERGP fee (which is the same as the RGP fee) plus any registration fees.\nAfter the end of the 120-day period, if you do not exercise your rights under this provision, you have abandoned the domain name services, and relinquish all interests and use of the domain name services.\nor</li>\n<li>If we auctioned the domain name services to a third party, we may transfer the domain name registration services to such third party.\nIn which case, the third party who won the auction for the domain name services will control the domain name services, including control over the WHOIS information and the DNS settings.\nYou may recover the domain name registration services prior to the end of the reactivation period, as such reactivation period applied to you.\nWe are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are or were auctioned.\nWe do not have to pay you any of the proceeds we may earn as a result of such an auction.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>TRANSFERS:\n<ol>\n<li>Transfer of your domain name(s) services shall be governed by ICANN\u2019s transfer policy, available at http://www.icann.org/transfers/, including the Registrar Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy, available at http://www.icann.org/en/transfers/dispute-policy-12jul04.htm as well as the UDRP and URS as described in Section 17 of this Agreement, as these policies may be modified from time to time.\nTo transfer your domain name(s) you should first login to your Account to lock or unlock your domain name(s) and/or to obtain the EPP \u201cAuthCode\u201d which is required to transfer domain services in an EPP registry (such as .org).\nAlternatively, you should contact your Primary Service Provider to have your domain name(s) services locked or unlocked or to obtain the EPP \u201cAuthCode.\u201d If your Primary Service Provider is unresponsive, you may contact us to have your domain name(s) locked or unlocked or to obtain the EPP \u201cAuthCode\u201d though we may first contact your Primary Service Provider to request that the Primary Service Provider address the request.\nOnly the registrant and the administrative contacts listed in the WHOIS information may approve or deny a transfer request.\nWithout limitation, domain name services may not be transferred within sixty (60) days of initial registration, within sixty (60) days of a transfer, if there is a dispute regarding the identity of the domain name registrant, if you are bankrupt, or if you fail to pay fees when due.\nWe will follow the procedures for both gaining and loosing registrars as outlined in ICANN\u2019s transfer policies.\nTransfer requests typically take five (5) business days to be processed.\nA transfer will not be processed if, during this time, the domain name registration services expire, in which event you may need to reinstate the transfer request following a redemption of the domain name, if any.\nYou may be required to resubmit a transfer request if there is a communication failure or other problem at either our end or at the registry.\nYOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR FAILURE OF A TRANSFER WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS INITIATED CLOSE TO THE END OF A REGISTRATION TERM.</li>\n<li>We may place a \u201cRegistrar Lock\u201d on your domain name services and this will prevent your domain name services from being transferred without your authorization, though we are not required to do so.\nBy allowing your domain name services to remain locked, you provide express objection to any and all transfer requests until the lock is removed.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>OWNERSHIP OF INFORMATION AND DATA: We own all database, compilation, collective and similar rights, title and interests worldwide in our domain name database, and all information and derivative works generated from the domain name database.\nWe own the following information for those registrations for which we are the registrar: (a) the original creation date of the registration, (b) the expiration date of the registration, (c) the name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available fax number of the registrant and all contacts for the domain name registration, (d) any remarks concerning the registered domain name that appear or should appear in the WHOIS or similar database, and (e) any other information we generate or obtain in connection with the provision of Services, other than the domain name being registered, the IP addresses of the primary nameserver and any secondary nameservers for the domain name, and the corresponding names of those nameservers.\nWe do not have any ownership interest in your specific personal registration information outside of our rights in our domain name database.</li>\n<li>AGENTS AND LICENSES: If you are registering a domain name for or on behalf of someone else, you represent that you have the authority to bind that person as a principal to all terms and conditions provided herein.\nIf you license the use of a domain name you register to us or a to third party, you remain the domain name holder of record, and remain responsible for all obligations at law and under this Agreement, including but not limited to payment obligations, and providing (and updating, as necessary) both your own full contact information, and accurate technical, administrative, billing and zone contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name and domain name registration and for ensuring non-infringement of any third party intellectual property rights or other rights.</li>\n<li>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (a) SUSPENSION OR LOSS OF THE SERVICES, (b) USE OF THE SERVICES, (c) INTERRUPTION OF SERVICES OR INTERRUPTION OF YOUR BUSINESS, (d) ACCESS DELAYS OR ACCESS INTERRUPTIONS TO OUR WEB SITE(S) OR SERVICES OR DELAYS OR ACCESS INTERRUPTIONS YOU EXPERIENCE IN RELATION TO A DOMAIN NAME REGISTERED WITH US.\n(e) LOSS OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM ACTS OF OR EVENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL (f) DATA NON-DELIVERY, MIS-DELIVERY, CORRUPTION, DESTRUCTION OR OTHER MODIFICATION.\n(g) THE PROCESSING OF AN APPLICATION FOR A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION.\n(h) LOSS OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD.\nOR (i) APPLICATION OF ANY DISPUTE POLICY.\nNEITHER WE NOR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF WE OR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL OUR OR YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER\u2019S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR SERVICES, BUT IN NO EVENT GREATER THAN FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS (US$400.00).\nBECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES, OUR AND YOUR PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER\u2019S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</li>\n<li>INDEMNITY: You hereby release, indemnify, and hold us, ICANN, the registry operators, and your Primary Service Provider, as well as the contractors, agents, employees, officers, directors, shareholders, and affiliates of such parties harmless from and against any and all liabilities, claims, damages, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs, for third party claims relating to or arising under this Agreement, including any breach of any of your representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Services provided hereunder, or your use of the Services, including, without limitation, infringement or alleged infringement by you, or by anyone else using the Services, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or from the violation or alleged violation of any of our or ICANN\u2019s operating rules or policies relating to the Services provided.\nWe may seek written assurances from you in which you promise to indemnify and hold us harmless from the costs and liabilities described in this paragraph.\nSuch written assurances may include, in our sole discretion, the posting of a performance bond(s) or other guarantees reasonably calculated to guarantee payment.\nYour failure to provide such assurances may be considered by us to be a breach of this Agreement by you and may, in our sole discretion, result in loss of your right to control the disposition of domain name Services for which you are the registrant and in relation to which we are the registrar of record.\nThis indemnification is in addition to any indemnification (a) required under the UDRP, URS, or any other ICANN policy or any policy of any relevant registry.\nor (b) set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.</li>\n<li>REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES: YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT NEITHER THE REGISTRATION OF A DOMAIN NAME NOR THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY USED NOR THE USE OF OTHER OF THE SERVICES INFRINGES THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY OR WILL OTHERWISE SUBJECT US TO A LEGAL CLAIM.\nTHE SERVICES ARE INTENDED FOR USE BY PERSONS WHO ARE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OLD AND BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OLD AND ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR PROCUREMENT OF THE SERVICES IS ACCURATE.\nALL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU \u201cAS IS\u201d AND WITH ALL FAULTS.\nEXCEPT FOR OUR STATEMENT REGARDING OUR ACCREDITATION AS ICANN-APPROVED DOMAIN NAME REGISTRARS, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, UNLESS SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ARE NOT LEGALLY EXCLUDABLE.\nWITHOUT ANY LIMITATION TO THE FOREGOING, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER THAT REGISTRATION OR USE OF A DOMAIN NAME UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL IMMUNIZE YOU EITHER FROM CHALLENGES TO YOUR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION, OR FROM SUSPENSION, CANCELLATION OR TRANSFER OF THE DOMAIN NAME REGISTERED TO YOU.\nANY MATERIAL AND/OR DATA DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF OUR E-MAIL FORWARDING OR OTHER EMAIL SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF SUCH MATERIAL AND/OR DATA.\nWE MAKE NO WARRANTY REGARDING ANY GOODS OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED THROUGH OUR E-MAIL SERVICES OR ANY TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH OUR E-MAIL SERVICES.\nNO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM US SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, SO SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</li>\n<li>DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY: You are bound by all ICANN consensus policies and all policies of any relevant registry, including but not limited to: (i) the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (\u201cUDRP\u201d), which is available at http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm and http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm along with the UDRP Rules and all Supplemental Rules of any UDRP provider.\nand (ii) the Uniform Rapid Suspension System (\u201cURS\u201d), which is available at http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/applicants/urs, along with the URS Rules and all Supplemental Rules of any URS provider.\nThe UDRP and URS may be changed by ICANN (or ICANN\u2019s successor) at any time.\nIf the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the UDRP and URS in effect at the time your domain name registration is disputed by the third party.\nIn the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions of the UDRP and URS.\nIf you or your domain name is the subject of litigation, we may deposit control of your domain name record into the registry of the judicial body by providing a party with a registrar certificate.</li>\n<li>GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION FOR DISPUTES:\n<ol>\n<li>Except as otherwise set forth in the UDRP, URS, or any similar ccTLD policy, with respect to any dispute over a domain name registration, this Agreement, your rights and obligations and all actions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of Washington, as if the Agreement was a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within the State of Washington.</li>\n<li>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of the agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in King County, Washington, before one arbitrator.\nThe arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures.\nJudgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThis clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\nService of process on you by us in relation to any dispute arising under this Agreement may be served upon you by first class mail to the address listed by you in your Account and/or domain name WHOIS information or by electronically transmitting a true copy of the papers to the email address listed by you in your Account and/or domain name WHOIS information.</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the adjudication of third party disputes (i.e., disputes between you and another party, not us) concerning or arising from use of domain names registered hereunder, you shall submit without objection, without prejudice to other potentially applicable jurisdictions, to the subject matter and personal jurisdiction of the courts (i) of the domicile of the registrant as it appears in the public WHOIS record for the domain name(s) in controversy, and (ii) where we are located, currently those State or federal courts whose geographic districts include Bellevue, Washington.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>NOTICES: Any notices required to be given under this Agreement by us to you will be deemed to have been given if delivered in accordance

performance of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter.\nnor shall the waiver by us of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself.\nIn the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole.\nWe will amend or replace such provision with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, our original objectives and intent as reflected in the original provision.\nThis Agreement may not be amended or modified by you except by means of a written document signed by
