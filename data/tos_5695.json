you do not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute and you wish to proceed, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties, in your county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is available Here.\nFor claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.\nIf the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorney's fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration.\nAny award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration.\nand/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration.\nAlthough we may have a right to an award of attorney's fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.\nTo the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against Company and/or its employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns.\nYou agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit.\nYou agree to pay the attorney's fees and court costs that Company incurs in seeking such relief.\nThis provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (A) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above.\nand (B) is an independent agreement.\nYou may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing
