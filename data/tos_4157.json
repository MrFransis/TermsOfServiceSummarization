effective September 25, 2018 1.\nIntroduction\n<p>Firefox Monitor is a service provided by Mozilla to promote online safety.\nWe strongly encourage people not to reuse passwords because\u2014if any of those accounts are compromised\u2014then hackers can access other accounts using the same account credentials.\nBecause account credentials are often reused when registering for services, we think it\u2019s important to know which accounts have been compromised in a publicly disclosed data breach.</p> 2.\nFeatures\n<p>Using your email address, you can do a Basic Scan on our website or sign up to receive a Full Report, Breach Alerts, and Safety Tips.<br>\n<em>\n<strong>Basic Scan:</strong> These results display most publicly known breaches.\nThey exclude \u201cSensitive Breaches\u201d (those including minors\u2019 data or participants of adult and dating sites) in order to protect the privacy of those account holders.<br>\n</em>\n<strong>Full Report:</strong> This includes a complete list of publicly known hacks, including Sensitive Breaches.\n* <strong>Breach Alerts:</strong> This notifies you if your email address appears in a new data breach.\n* <strong>Safety Tips:</strong> This sends you occasional online safety tips from Mozilla.</p>\n3.\nYour Responsibilities\n<p>If you become aware that your account credentials have been compromised, you should immediately update your passwords and any other credentials for those accounts, as well as other services using the same or similar account information.\nIt is your responsibility to protect your online accounts using strong and different passwords, security questions, two-factor authentication, password managers, and other safety measures.\n</p>\n4.\nPrivacy\n<p>When Mozilla receives information from you, our Mozilla Privacy Policy describes how we handle that information.\nHere are things you should know about Firefox Monitor:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you sign up, we (and our email providers SalesForce and Amazon) receive your email address to contact you in connection with the Firefox Monitor Service, which includes Full Reports, Breach Alerts, and Safety Tips.\nYou can unsubscribe at any time.\n</li>\n<li>The data that powers Firefox Monitor is provided by Have I Been Pwned? </li>\n<li>Learn more about our cookies and analytics, and how to opt-out.</li>\n<li>Learn more about the measures we take to protect the privacy of your email address.\n</li>\n</ul>\n5.\nYour and Our Rights\n<p>The Websites and Communications Terms of Use governs Mozilla websites and emails we send, including those of Firefox Monitor.\n<strong>It includes an indemnification, disclaimer, and limitation on liability.</strong> Although Firefox Monitor and Have I Been Pwned?, strive to have current data, there is no guarantee that either will have complete or timely records of all public data breaches.\n</p> ", "created_at": "2021-06-21 00:51:36.460103", "updated_at": "2021-06-21

9, 2020 What do we mean by \"personal information?\"\n<p>For us, \"personal information\" means information which either directly identifies you (like your name, email address, or billing information) or can be reasonably linked or combined to identify you (like an account identification number or IP address).\nWe\u2019ll always tell you what personal information we\u2019re collecting from you.\nSee each product\u2019s Privacy Notice for specific details.</p>\n<p>Any information that falls outside of this is \"non-personal information.\"</p>\n<p>If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information.\nIf we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.</p>\nHow do we learn information about you?\n<p>We learn information about you when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash reports);</li>\n<li>we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., when your Firefox browser checks with us to see if is up to date);</li>\n<li>someone else tells us information about you (e.g., when Thunderbird works with your email providers to set up your account).\nor</li>\n<li>when we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize language for some of our services).</li>\n</ul>\nWhat do we do with your information once we have it?\n<p>When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission.\nGenerally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.</p>\n<p>For users in the EU, EEA, Switzerland, and California: see here for more information.</p>\nWhen do we share your information with others?\n<ul>\n<li>When we have asked and received your permission to share it.</li>\n<li>For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla.</li>\n<li>When we are fulfilling our mission of being open.\nWe sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web, but when we do so, we will remove your personal information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.</li>\n<li>When the law requires it.\nWe follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit.\nWe'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so.\nWhen we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so.\nNothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.</li>\n<li>When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else.\nWe will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Mozilla or the public.</li>\n<li>If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.</li>\n</ul>\nHow do we store and protect your personal information?\n<p>We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it.\nWe implement physical, business and technical security measures.\nDespite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.</p>\n<p>We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for.\nOnce we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.</p>\nWhat if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?\n<p>We may need to change this policy and our notices.\nThe updates will be posted online.\nIf the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums.\nYour continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.\nTo make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.</p> Contact Mozilla <p>If you want to make a correction to your information, or you have any questions about our privacy policies, please get in
