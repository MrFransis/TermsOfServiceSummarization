important to JAMF Software, LLC.\nAs a result, we\u2019ve developed this Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information.\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nOverview</strong>\n</p>\n<p>JAMF Software, LLC and its Affiliates (herein collectively \u201cJamf\u201d) makes reasonable efforts to protect the privacy of your personal information.\nThis Privacy Policy was created to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices.\nThis

with us, including when you attend events hosted or attended by Jamf and when you contact us for customer support (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d).</p>\n<p>In addition to covering how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information, this policy also discloses our purpose and lawful basis for processing your information, and your related rights.\nOur legal basis for collecting and using personal information will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.\nIn most cases, the lawful basis will be that the processing (i) is necessary for our legitimate interests in carrying out our business with you, including direct marketing, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests, or (ii) is necessary to perform a contract with you.\nWhere processing is based on your consent, we will identify the processing purposes and provide you with relevant information to make the processing fair and transparent.\nIf you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.</p>\n<p>Our Services are not directed to anyone under the age of 16, and Jamf does not knowingly solicit or collect information from anyone under 16 years of age.\nIf you

reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.\nIf you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use certain features or functionality of our Services that depend on your web browser accepting cookies.\nYou can also use opt-out tools provided by third party partners, or by the Digital Advertising Alliance (http://www.aboutads.info/choices), the EU Internet advertising industry (http://www.youronlinechoices.eu), or similar entities.\nWhere required, Jamf obtains consent prior to using cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics.</strong> Jamf uses analytical

vendors, or sub-processors to perform functions such as sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, data storage, processing credit card payments, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), and providing customer service.\nSuch companies shall only use your information for those purposes required to perform their functions.\nAdditionally, Jamf may share your information, without your prior consent, in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, or transfer of assets.\nWhen information is shared, Jamf will ascertain that any third parties are obligated to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required under this policy.\nShould Jamf transfer information outside of a local jurisdiction, it shall only be done with adequate protections in place and in compliance with applicable laws and standards.</p>\n<p>Jamf may share your information if we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) protect and defend the rights or property of Jamf, (ii) enforce this Privacy Policy or the Services\u2019 terms and conditions of access and use agreement, (iii) participate in dispute resolution pursuant to this Privacy Policy, (iv) protect the interests of other users of the Services or any other person, or (v) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of the Services or equipment.</p>\n<p>Jamf may be required to disclose an individual's information in response to a lawful request by public

damage.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>F: Internation Data Transfer</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your personal information might be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are a resident.\nThese countries may have data protection and privacy laws that are different than the laws of your home country.\nJamf only transfers personal information to other countries in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, provided there are legally adequate protections in place for the personal information.\nA list of Jamfs\u2019 global offices is available here.</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) and your personal information is transferred outside of the EEA, we will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process it in a territory which the European Commission has determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal information.\nor</li>\n<li>Otherwise implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, including by Standard Contractual Clauses or another lawful transfer mechanism approved by the European Commission.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jamf and Wandera, Inc.\ncomply with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.\nJamf and Wandera, Inc.\nhave certified to the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.\nAdditionally, our organization commits to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) and comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of the employment relationship.</p>\n<p>Jamf will continue to adhere to the Privacy Shield frameworks and Principles even though the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) determined in July 2020 that the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield framework is no longer an adequate transfer mechanism for the transfer of EU personal information to the U.S.\nJamf has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers for more information and to file a complaint.\nUnder certain circumstances, individuals may invoke binding arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>G.\nProtection of Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Taking into account the risks involved in the processing and nature of information and to prevent loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction and while maintaining data accuracy, Jamf has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial policies and procedures to safeguard the information Jamf collects.\nAny payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology.\nHowever, the safety and security of your information also depends on you.\nWhere you have chosen or we have given you a username and password for access to certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping the username and password confidential.\nAlthough we do our best to protect the information, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of your information.</p>\n<p>For more information on how we protect information, see https://www.jamf.com/trust-center/.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>H.\nRetention</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Jamf will only retain your information in an identifiable form for as long as it serves the purposes for which it was collected.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I.\nOther Limits to Your Privacy </strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Services may contain links to other non-Jamf websites.\nJamf is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.\nJamf has no control over the use of such websites, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any information on these websites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>J.\nChoice </strong>\n</p>\n<p>We seek to provide you with choices regarding the information you provide to us.\nYou can always opt not to disclose information.\nHowever, if you elect to do so, this may impact functionality or prevent the use of Jamf\u2019s products or service.\nYou have the right, at any time, to opt-out of receiving marketing messages from Jamf by sending an email to privacy@jamf.com, by unsubscribing through the unsubscribe or opt-out link in an email, or by unsubscribing here.\nWe will try to comply with your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable.\nPlease note that if you opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails from us, we may still send you important operational or administrative messages.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>K.\nAccess and Correction</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to access the personal information we hold about you.\nYou may access your information that Jamf holds by contacting us via Section M below.\nYou have the right to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of applicable privacy laws, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual\u2019s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.</p>\n<p>To protect your privacy and security, Jamf may also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before making corrections to or deleting your account.</p>\n<p>Jamf processes some personal information solely on behalf of its customers in the course of delivering Services.\nThis personal information is processed to accomplish the business purposes of the customer to whom the Services are provided, and often, Jamf will not have a direct relationship with the subject of this personal information.\nIn these cases, Jamf recommends first contacting the organization to which your personal information was originally provided with any data privacy questions.\nThe organization can contact Jamf if escalation of your query is necessary.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>L.\nRegulatory Oversight</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For this Privacy Policy and its content, Jamf is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\nIf Jamf becomes subject to an FTC or court order based on non-compliance with this policy or applicable privacy law, Jamf shall make public any relevant information of any compliance or assessment report submitted to the FTC, to the extent consistent with confidentiality requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>M.\nHow to Contact Us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or complaints about this Privacy Policy or if you would like to request access to the personal information that we may maintain about you, please contact us as follows:</p>\n<p>JAMF Software, LLC<br> 100 Washington Avenue South<br> Suite 1100<br> Minneapolis, MN 55401<br>
