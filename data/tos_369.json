Our cookie policy explains the types of cookies and other similar tracking technologies that we and our partners apply when you visit or use the Riot services.</p>\n<p>When we say \u2018Riot Games,\u2019 we\u2019re referring to Riot Games Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Riot Games, Inc., and its subsidiaries.\nWhen we refer to \u2018Riot services\u2019, we mean League of Legends and any other games, websites, apps and services that link to this policy, regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile devices.</p>\n<p>Our cookie policy should be read in conjunction with the <strong>Privacy policy</strong> for the Riot services in your region.\nBy using or accessing the Riot services, you\u2019re consenting to the practices described below (except to the extent you choose to disable them).</p> Table of Contents <ul>\n<li> What is a cookie? </li>\n<li> Why are cookies used on the Riot services? </li>\n<li> Who places cookies on my device? </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li> How can I manage cookies? </li>\n<li> Do-not-track signals </li>\n<li> Policy updates </li>\n<li> Contact us </li>\n</ul> 1.\nWhat is a cookie? <p>\u201cCookies\u201d are small pieces of data (often text files) that are placed on your computer or device by the Riot services that you visit or our partners.\nAs a standard feature of major browser applications, cookies are widely used to make online services work or operate more efficiently, as well as to provide info to the providers of those online services about your browsing experiences.\nWhen you return to those same online services again, your browser sends the previously stored cookies back to the online service which allows it to recognise you and remember important info to make your use of the online services more personalized or convenient, such as by remembering your saved preferences.</p>\n<p>We and our partners also use other technologies, including data stored on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other software for similar purposes.\nThis includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Pixel tags</strong>: Pixel tags (also called beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage, email, app, or ads which can retrieve certain info about your device and browser and how you interact with it.\nThis includes, for example, information about your device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address, whether you\u2019ve opened an email or clicked on an ad, and other similar info, including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device.\nPixels provide the means by which third parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and collect info about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Local storage</strong> : This refers generally to other places on a browser or device where info can be stored by websites, ads, or third parties (such as HTML5 local storage and browser cache).\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Software development kits</strong>: Software development kits (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function.\nPieces of code (the SDK) are installed in the app that allow us and our partners to collect certain info about your interaction with the app and info about your device and network.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Flash cookies</strong>: This is a technology that can provide cookie-equivalent functionality and is capable of storing information on your device.\nThis information is often stored in a different file to other cookies.\nThis means it has to be managed and deleted in a different way.\nWe explain below how you can do this.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>IP address</strong>: IP address is the short form for Internet Protocol address which is assigned by internet access providers to every computer that is connected to the internet.\nWebsite owners have access to IP addresses of their users.\nUsing IP addresses, we and our partners can identify the country, state and city from which a computer is connecting to the Internet.\nIP addresses are, for example, used for IP geolocation purposes, e.g.\nby Google Analytics.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Device identifiers</strong> : We may also collect your IP address, unique device identifier or create a unique device fingerprint (this is a unique combination of different information from your device so that we can single it out) so we can identify your device.\nWe may then use this in a similar way to cookies.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this policy, we refer to all of these and similar technologies as \u201ccookies.\u201d These technologies can be used to recognise when your device does things.\nFor instance, they may recognise when you visit pages on our or others\u2019 sites, use parts of an app or when you open emails we send you, or links in technologies.</p>\n<p> Back To Top\n</p> 2.\nWhy are cookies used on the Riot services? <p>We and our partners use cookies to automatically record some info about how you use and navigate the Riot services and to recognize use of the Riot services.\nThis, in particular, helps to identify you, analyze, improve and secure the Riot services and to personalise content and features and tailor and measure ads, both on and off the Riot services.</p>\n<p>Whilst the cookies used on the Riot services change from time to time as we improve and update the Riot services, they generally fall into the below categories of use:</p>\n<p>\n</p>ESSENTIAL COOKIES <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Authentication:</strong> We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you\u2019re logged in so we can make it easier for you to access the Riot services and show you the appropriate information, experience and features.\nFor example, we use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between different pages on the Riot service or access secured portions of the Riot services.\nCookies also help us remember your browser so you do not have to keep logging into the Riot services.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Security:</strong>We use cookies to provide necessary checks and controls to protect both you and us.\nFor example, they help us to authenticate your use, prevent fraudulent use of access credentials maintain the confidentiality of your data and to help us detect malicious activity and violation of our Terms of Service.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>FUNCTIONAL COOKIES <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Preferences and features:</strong> We use cookies to enable the functionality that helps us provide the Riot services.\nFor instance, we use cookies to help us remember certain info about your choices, preferences, how far you are through an order and what you\u2019ve seen or done on the Riot services to enhance your experience on the Riot services.\nThey allow us to better personalise your visits to the Riot services by remembering things like your selected region, language, or display settings.\nThis help us show you appropriate options and display customized content accordingly when you return to the Riot services.\nFor example, by remembering your region and language, the Riot services may be able to provide you with local articles or schedules for upcoming events in your area, and do so in your local language.\nWe may also use cookies to capture your preferred audio and visual settings (such as, text size, font, resolution, etc.), reference websites, the sequence of pages within the Riot services that you visit, and other similar details about your browsing behaviour and choices about how the Riot services behave or look.\nThis helps us to, among other things, monitor and improve the Riot services, personalize your browsing experience and facilitate return visits.\nMany of the features should still work without preference cookies.\nHowever, your experience may be less functional and you may need to re-enter your preferences each time you visit.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>ANALYTICAL COOKIES <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Analytics and research:</strong> We use cookies to collect info about your interactions with the Riot services which helps us to understand and analyse how you use the Riot services and improve them.\nFor example, they help us understand and analyse which pages are the most frequently visited, identify when you may encounter difficulties and identify ways to improve the Riot services.\nIn other words, they allow us to see and analyse overall patterns of usage on the Riot services, analyse general traffic and show the ways you interact with the Riot services.\nWe may also engage partners from time-to-time to help us better understand and analyse how you interact with the Riot services, including by placing analytics and research cookies on our behalf.\nFor example, we use third-party analytics providers like Google Analytics to help evaluate and report on use of the Riot services.\nThese companies may set and read their own tracking technologies to gather info about your online activities across websites and services.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>ADVERTISING COOKIES <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising, insight and measurement:</strong>- We and our partners use cookies to collect info about your visit to the Riot services and your use of them to deliver ads for businesses and other organisations that we or our partners think may be of interest to you, both on and off the Riot services.\nThis is done based upon your usage of our and others\u2019 sites.\nFor example, we or our partners may draw insights about you based upon what you use on the Riot services or viewed on other sites and use that to deliver an add considered relevant to you.\nThese types of ads are called \u201cInterest-Based Advertising.\u201d We and our partners also use cookies to measure the performance of ad campaigns.\nFor instance, we and our partners use cookies to count the number of times an ad is shown and to measure how often people do things like click on or view ads both on and off the Riot services.\nWe work with third-party partners that set their own cookies in this regard.\nFor example, our advertising partners may use cookies to help serve you ads better tailored to the interests you\u2019ve shown by browsing the Riot services or other online services operated by third parties, determine whether you\u2019ve seen a particular advertisement before (to prevent showing you duplicate ones) and for other lawful business purposes.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We and our partners may link any of the information we collect through cookies and other technologies (such as browser history): </p>\n<ul>\n<li>with information you provide.\nand</li>\n<li>with information we obtain from other sources, including from both online and offline data providers (such as demographic data and interest based data).\nand</li>\n<li>where you agree to this in accordance with your privacy settings on social sites, with information we obtain from social sites (such as with respect to your usage of it or your posts, messages or comments on it).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Back To Top\n</p> 3.\nWho places cookies on my device? <p>Cookies may be placed on your device by Riot Games as the operator of the Riot services.\nThese cookies are called \u201cfirst party\u201d cookies.\nSome cookies may also be placed on your device, when using the Riot services, by one of our partners.\nThese cookies are called \u201cthird party\u201d cookies and are used to provide services to us and others.\nTherefore, some cookies that have been set on the Riot services are not related to Riot Games.\nWhen you visit a Riot service with content embedded from, say Google\u2019s DoubleClick, Nanigans.com or Ad4game.com, these partners may set their own cookies on your web browser.\nThese record your visit to the Riot services and this info is shared with other organisations such as advertisers.</p>\n<p>We do not control third party cookies and cannot access them due to the way that cookies work, as cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them.\nPlease read our partners privacy policies to ensure you are comfortable with how they use cookies.\nTo learn more about companies that provided \u201cthird party\u201d cookies on Riot services and how they use information about you, click here.</p>\n<p>When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Facebook or social media widgets like the Facebook like button, these service providers may use their own cookies or similar technologies.\nWe do not control them.</p>\n<p> Back To Top\n</p> 4.\nHow can I manage cookies? <p>Where the relevant Riot service has the Cookie Consent Tool incorporated, you can use it to refuse or accept cookies from the Riot services at any time.</p>\n<p>You can find out more about how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and disable them at All About Cookies.\nYou can also find info about how to enable or disable cookies on your Internet browser provider\u2019s website via your help screen.</p>\n<p>To learn more about how advertisers generally use cookies and the choices they offer, you can review the following resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Digital Advertising Alliance </li>\n<li> Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada </li>\n<li> European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance </li>\n<li> Network Advertising Alliance </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to clear all cookies left behind by online services including the Riot services you have visited, here are links where you can download programs that clean out tracking cookies: Lavasoft and Spybot.</p>\n<p>Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies.\nTo learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, please consult the instructions provided by Adobe here.</p>\n<p>When you install our apps, SDKs are installed.\nYou cannot deactivate an SDK.\nConsequently, do not install our apps if you are not happy with the use of SDKs.</p>\n<p>We do not control third party cookies and cannot access them due to the way that cookies work, as cookies can only be accessed by the party who originally set them.\nYou should check the third party websites for more info about these cookies.\nTo learn more about companies that provided \u201cthird party\u201d cookies through Riot services and how to manage their cookies, click here.</p>\n<p>Please note that opting-out of interest-based advertising won\u2019t necessarily entirely prevent info from being collected automatically on the Riot services, and it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll receive fewer ads or stop them from being displayed.\nInstead, the ads you do receive won\u2019t be interest-based any longer and, therefore, might be less relevant to your interests.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of the Riot services may operate as intended.</p>\n<p>To learn more about opting out of Google Analytics, which uses cookies as well as your IP address, click here.</p>\n<p> Back To Top\n</p> 5.\nDo-not-track signals <p>Our services don\u2019t respond to Internet browser \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals.\nSome newer Internet browsers incorporate DNT features.\nIf activated, these features often send a signal to the services you visit indicating that you don\u2019t want to be tracked in some way.\nThose services (or content on them placed by third parties) may continue to engage in activities you may view as tracking even though you\u2019ve expressed this preference, depending on the service\u2019s privacy practices.</p>\n<p>Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Riot Games does not currently respond to browser DNT signals on the Riot services.</p>\n<p> Back To Top\n</p> 6.\nPolicy updates <p>We may update our policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, legislation, our operations, or as we otherwise determine is necessary or appropriate.\nAny such changes will become effective when we make the revised policy available on or through the Riot services.\nWe encourage you to review the \u201cEffective date\u201d legend above frequently to ensure you are aware of when our policy was last revised, and to help you better understand the nature of your interactions with the Riot services.</p>\n<p> Back To

submitting info like your name or email address to us.\nIf you do choose to visit or use the Riot Services, we generally retain the related personal information as long as your account is active or as is otherwise necessary to provide the Riot services, operate our business (including for legitimate purposes like complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing

particular attention to these items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Dispute Resolution.\nIf you reside in the United States, please read the binding arbitration clause and class action waiver in Part A

you must: (i) be an adult.\n(ii) be an emancipated minor.\nor (iii) have valid parent or legal guardian consent to be bound by these Terms.\nIf you\u2019re not an adult or emancipated minor, or don\u2019t understand this section, please talk to your parents or legal guardian and ask for help.\nIf you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor who creates an account with us, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms.\nYou are also responsible for all use of the account and compliance with these Terms by the minor, including all purchases made on the account.\nYou may not create or use an account or use any of the Riot Services on behalf of any other person or other legal entity or for a commercial purpose.\n</p>\n1.2.\n<u>Do I need to provide my real name and stuff?</u>\n<strong> (Yes.\nPlease don\u2019t try to pull any kind of \u201cDefinitely Not Blitzcrank\u201d or \u201cDefinitely Not Udyr\u201d funny business.)</strong>\n<p>You must always supply us with accurate and complete info including your real name.\n</p>\n1.3.\n<u>I have a ton of different email accounts.\nDoes it matter which one I use to register my account?</u>\n<strong> (Yes.\nOtherwise, you might miss important notices!)</strong>\n<p>We send account, legal and service related notices to the email address registered to your account.\nThese notifications may be really important (e.g., a notification that we intend to terminate your account for inactivity) so you must keep the email address associated with your account current and (if we ask) verified.</p>\n1.4.\n<u>Can I share or sell my account or login credentials?</u>\n<strong> (No.)</strong>\n<p>When you create an account with us, we require you to select a unique username and password (collectively, your \u201c<strong>Login Credentials</strong>\u201d).\nYou agree that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can\u2019t share your account or Login Credentials with anyone.\n</li>\n<br>\n<li>You

secret.\n</li>\n&nbsp.\n</ul>\n<p>You must notify us immediately if you become aware of any breach of security, including any unauthorized account access or any loss, theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of your Login Credentials or payment info so we can take appropriate steps.\nYou are responsible for all losses (including loss or use of Virtual Content) on your account where you have shared your Login Credentials or have failed to keep your account or Login Credentials secure.\n</p> 2.\nACCOUNT TERMINATION 2.1.\n<u>How can my account be suspended or terminated?</u>\n<strong> (If you break the rules, Demacian Justice will be visited upon your account!)</strong>\n<p>2.1.1.\n<strong>\n<u>You.</u>\n</strong> You may terminate or suspend your account at any time by contacting us at support@riotgames.com .</p>\n<p>2.1.2.\n<strong>\n<u>Us.</u>\n</strong> We may terminate or suspend your account without notice to you if we reasonably determine, that: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>you have breached any part of these Terms (including the User Rules);</li>\n<br>\n<li>doing so would be in the best interests of our community or the Riot Services or is required for upholding a third party\u2019s rights;</li>\n<br>\n<li>we have stopped offering the Riot Services in your region (though we\u2019ll normally post advance notice on our website, app or game if we plan to stop offering a material core feature of a game or all of the Riot Services in your region);</li>\n<br>\n<li>you have failed to pay any fees you owe us (except in cases of our gross negligence or willful misconduct) or we have to refund someone due to unauthorized use of a payment made from your account.\nor</li>\n<br>\n<li>you have (or we have reasonable grounds for suspecting that you have) made unauthorized use of someone else\u2019s payment info.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can make such determinations, with the assistance of automated systems and machine learning tools or by using other methods that we think are appropriate.\nIf you think that we have made a mistake, please Contact Us with details and we will review your case, though we may suspend your account during our review.\nYou can also challenge our determinations (see Section 17).</p>\n2.2.\n<u>Will Riot maintain my account forever, even if I stop using it?</u>\n<strong> (If you abandon your account for a very long period of time, we may terminate it after giving you notice and an opportunity to re-activate it.)</strong>\n<p>If you do not use your account for a prolonged period of time, we reserve the right to take measures against your account, including suspension or termination.\nIf we plan to take measures against your account based on prolonged period of inactivity, we will let you know first (e.g., by email to the email address registered to your account) and give you ample opportunity to avoid such measures (e.g., deletion of your account).</p>\n2.3.\n<u>What happens if Riot terminates my account?</u>\n<strong> (No games for you and you will lose access to any purchases including Game Currency and Virtual Goods.)</strong>\n<p>If your account is terminated, you\u2019ll no longer have access to your account, including any of the associated data or Virtual Content (including Game Currency) (though this does not limit or affect any rights you have under data or consumer protection laws).\nWhere we terminate for a legitimate reason (e.g.\nwhere you have breached these Terms):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you\u2019ll not be entitled to any refunds and we\u2019ll have no liability to you.\nand</li>\n<br>\n<li>we also reserve the right to terminate any other accounts you may have created, as well as your access to any other Riot Services (also without any refunds or liability to you).</li>\n&nbsp.\n</ul>\n<p>You understand and agree that using the Riot Services comes with the risk that your account may be terminated or suspended in accordance with these Terms and that, whenever you use the Riot Services, you\u2019ll bear this risk in mind and always conduct yourself appropriately.\n</p> 3.\nLIMITED LICENSE 3.1.\n<u>What can I do with the Riot Services?</u>\n<strong> (You can enjoy the Riot Services for your own, personal, non-commercial use.)</strong>\n<p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use and enjoy the Riot Services (and any Virtual Content) for your individual, non-commercial, entertainment purposes only and expressly conditioned upon your compliance with these Terms.\nIf we terminate your account, any license granted by us to you in the Riot Services and any Virtual Content ends immediately.\nUnless otherwise expressly authorized by us in a signed written contract, you may not sell, copy, exchange, loan, reverse engineer, decompile, derive source code from, translate, lease, grant a security interest in, transfer, publish, assign or otherwise distribute any of the Riot Services or any of Riot Games\u2019 intellectual property, including any of our computer code or Virtual Content.</p>\n3.2.\n<u>Can I do stuff with Riot\u2019s intellectual property?</u>\n<strong> (We reserve all the rights to our IP, but do allow for some personal, non-commercial uses, like fan art.)</strong>\n<p>We (and our licensors) own and reserve all rights, title and interest in and to the Riot Services, and all data and content posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available in or through the Riot Services, including, user accounts, computer code, titles, objects, artifacts, characters, character names, chat logs, game

virtual goods, in-game currency, audio-visual effects, character likenesses, methods of operation and gameplay (collectively, \u201c<strong>Game Content</strong>\u201d).\nFor clarity, Game Content includes Virtual Content.\nYou can\u2019t create any work of authorship based on the Game Content or Riot Services except as expressly permitted by us.\nFor more info about what fan uses we currently permit, please read our Legal Jibber Jabber policy (though be aware that we change this from time to time).</p>\n<p>You also agree that unless we grant you a license, in a written contract signed by us, you may never use any of our trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, taglines, or trade dress.\nAny reproduction, redistribution, or modification of the Riot Services, or use of the Riot Services not in accordance with these Terms, is expressly prohibited and may result in severe civil and/or criminal penalties.</p> 4.\nVIRTUAL GOODS, GAME CURRENCY AND PURCHASES 4.1.\n<u>What is Virtual Content?</u>\n<strong> (Virtual content includes stuff like game currency and virtual goods, such as champions, skins, emotes, accessories, etc.)</strong>\n<p>When using the Riot Services, we may provide you with opportunities to acquire a limited license to access virtual goods, such as champions, skins, emotes, etc., (\u201c<strong>Virtual Goods</strong>\u201d) and in-game currency (\u201c<strong>Game Currency</strong>\u201d), associated with your account (collectively, \u201c<strong>Virtual Content</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>Game Currency may only be used for the specific game for which it was purchased unless we say otherwise at the time of purchase.</p> 4.2.\n<u>How do I get a \u201clicense\u201d to access Virtual Content?</u>\n<strong> (Buy it, earn it, or receive it.)</strong>\n<p>We may provide you with various opportunities to acquire a limited license to access Game Currency or Virtual Content, including:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>purchasing it (e.g., with a credit card).\n</li>\n<br>\n<li>earning it (e.g., by accomplishing game missions or tasks).\nor</li>\n<br>\n<li>receiving it (e.g., from another player as a gift or using crafting functionality like Hextech\u00ae).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n4.3.\n<u>Do I \u201cown\u201d the Virtual Content I unlock?</u>\n<strong> (No.\nWhat you \u201cunlock\u201d is not the virtual good itself, but rather, a non-transferable limited license to access it.)</strong>\n<p>You have no ownership or other property interest in any of the Virtual Content you unlock, regardless of how you acquired access to it.\nVirtual Content has no monetary value.\nYou can\u2019t transfer (unless we allow it in the functionality of the Riot Services) or redeem Virtual Content for any type of \u201creal world\u201d money.\nYou can\u2019t obtain any refunds for purchasing a license to access Virtual Content, except as expressly permitted by us.\nYou can find our current content refund policy here.</p>\n4.4.\n<u>Once again: I don\u2019t <em>own</em> my Virtual Content?</u>\n<strong> (\u201cNo!\u201d shouted all the lawyers.)</strong>\n<p>When you obtain Virtual Content from us, what we are actually giving you is a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, revocable, limited right and license to use that Virtual Content only in connection with your use of the applicable Riot Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that you shall have no ownership or other property interest in your account, and that all rights in and to your account are and shall forever be owned by and inure to the benefit of Riot Games.\nYou further acknowledge and agree that you have no title, ownership, or other proprietary interest in any Virtual Content, regardless of any consideration offered or paid in exchange.\nFurthermore, except in cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence, or to the extent these Terms say otherwise, Riot Games shall not be liable in any manner for the destruction, deletion, modification, impairment, hacking, or any other damage or loss of any kind caused to Virtual Content, including the deletion of Virtual Content upon the termination or expiration of your account or our reasonable changes to the Riot Services.</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n4.5.\n<u>Will my Virtual Content always be available?</u>\n<strong> (Not necessarily, no.)</strong>\n<p>In an effort to constantly improve the Riot Services, evolve our games and keep the Riot Services, safe, fun, and secure, we have the right to delete, alter, move, remove, re-package, re-price, or transfer any and all Game Content, including Virtual Content, in whole or in part, at any time, with or without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you.\nFor example, your Virtual Goods may (and likely will) evolve over time to improve the Riot Services or for regulatory or legal reasons.\nIf we decide to entirely retire certain Virtual Goods that you recently purchased, we will provide you with a replacement.\nWe won\u2019t delete your Game Currency without notice (such as through posts on our website, app or game), unless your account is terminated by us for a legitimate reason or by you under Section 2.1.1.\nWe may sometimes change the purchasing power of Game Currency (for example, we might increase the number of Game Currency needed to purchase Virtual Goods, such as skins).\nWe normally only do this in incremental steps but we\u2019ll give you notice (such as through posts on our website, app or game) if we plan to make changes that will significantly impact your Game Currency in a negative way.\nWe don\u2019t provide or guarantee, and expressly disclaim, any value, cash or otherwise, attributed to any data residing on servers we operate or control, including any Game Content or Virtual Content attributed to your account.\nIf we allow the sale or transfer of your right to access certain Game Content or Virtual Content, it may only be conducted via services approved or provided by us, if any.\n</p> 5.\nFEES &amp.\nTAXES 5.1.\n<u>Is everything about the Riot Services free?</u>\n<strong> (No.)</strong>\n<p>Some aspects of the Riot Services may require you to pay a fee, and you agree that you\u2019ll provide accurate and complete payment info to us or the third-party payment provider used by us.\nYou further agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred on your account.\nWe may revise the pricing for any part of the Riot Services at any time.\nThis can impact on the purchasing power of your Game Currency, though we normally only do this in incremental steps.\nAll fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes due and payable.\nWe may, from time to time, modify, amend, or supplement our fees and fee-billing methods, and such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting in these Terms or elsewhere on our websites, apps or in our games.\nExcept in cases of our gross negligence or willful misconduct, if you fail to pay any fees you owe to us or we have to refund someone due to unauthorized use of a payment made from your account, we may suspend or terminate your account.\nSee Section 2 (Account Termination) for more info.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Subject to applicable law, any applicable fees and other charges for fee-based services (including Game Currency) are payable in advance and aren\u2019t refundable in whole or in part except as expressly provided in these Terms.\nExcept in cases of Riot\u2019s gross negligence, or willful misconduct or to the extent these Terms say otherwise, you\u2019re fully liable for all charges to your account, including any unauthorized charges.\n</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n5.2.\n<u>What are my responsibilities relating to Game Currency?</u>\n<strong> (Pay applicable taxes.\nverify that all transactions with us are correct, etc.)</strong>\n<p>You\u2019re solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to acquiring, using, or accessing Game Currency.\nGame Currency may be sold or issued by us in bundles and the price may vary depending on the amount you purchase and where you\u2019re purchasing.\nAs we feel it necessary, in our reasonable discretion (or as prescribed by law), we may limit the total amount of Game Currency that may be purchased for any one game or that may be held in your account in the aggregate.\nAdditionally, price and availability of Game Currency and Virtual Goods are subject to change.\nWe may restrict how much Game Currency you can purchase and/or use based on your location as we have different approaches in different locations.</p>\n<p>You should verify that the proper amount of Game Currency has been added to or deducted from your account during any given transaction.\nPlease notify us immediately if you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Game Currency balance.\nWe\u2019ll investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional info to verify it.</p> 6.\nUNSOLICITED IDEA SUBMISSION POLICY 6.1.\n<u>Can I submit ideas for improving the Game to Riot?</u>\n<strong> (Please don\u2019t.\nIf you do anyways, we\u2019ll have the absolute right to use it forever.)</strong>\n<p>We value your feedback on the Riot Services, but please don\u2019t submit any creative ideas, suggestions or materials to us (collectively, \u201c<strong>Unsolicited Ideas</strong>\u201d).\nWe may freely use any Unsolicited Ideas you provide.\nThis policy is aimed at avoiding potential misunderstandings or disputes when the Riot Services might seem similar to Unsolicited Ideas that people submit.</p>\n<p>You may not have any legal rights in the Unsolicited Ideas you insist on sending to us, but if you do, we will be allowed to use all or some of your Unsolicited Ideas for any reason we choose and without any payment to you.</p>\n<p>In legal terms, this means that if you submit Unsolicited Ideas to us, then you grant us a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable, transferable, assignable, non-exclusive, and royalty-free right and license to use, reproduce, distribute, adapt, modify, translate, create derivative works based upon, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally perform, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, and import your Unsolicited Ideas, including all copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, designs, industrial rights, and all other intellectual and proprietary rights related to them, in any media now known or in the future developed, for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, including giving the Unsolicited Ideas to others, without any compensation to you.\nTo the extent necessary, you agree that you undertake to execute and deliver any and all documents and perform any and all actions necessary or desirable to ensure that the rights to use the Unsolicited Ideas granted to us as specified above are valid, effective, and enforceable and you waive and agree never to assert those rights to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of your jurisdiction.</p> 7.\nUSER RULES 7.1.\n<u>Can I troll, flame, threaten or harass people while using the Riot Services?</u>\n<strong> (No.\nIf you do, we might take action such as banning your account.)</strong>\n<p>While using the Riot Services, you must comply with all laws, rules and regulations in the

post.)</strong>\n<p>Apart from Unsolicited Ideas (which we address separately, in Section 6, above), you\u2019re also responsible for any other communications, user names, images, sounds, or other

to learn more.)</strong>\n<p>We may actively monitor the use of the Riot Services (but have no obligation to do so), both on our own servers and on your computer or device, for a wide variety of different purposes, including preventing cheating and hacking, reducing toxic player behavior, and improving the Riot Services.\nPlease be sure to read our Privacy Notice for important details about how we obtain and process info in connection with your use of the Riot Services.</p> 10.\nUPDATES AND MODIFICATIONS 10.1.\n<u>Will these Terms change in the future?</u>\n<strong> (Yes.)</strong>\n<p>We may (and probably will) create updated versions of these Terms in the future as the Riot Services and applicable laws evolve.\nWhen we do, we\u2019ll inform you of the new agreement which will supersede and replace these Terms.\nYou\u2019ll be given an opportunity to review any new agreement we present to you and decide whether you wish to agree to the revised terms.\nIf you accept the new agreement, you\u2019ll be able to continue using the Riot Services.\nIf you decline the new agreement, you won\u2019t be able to use the Riot Services anymore.</p>\n10.2.\n<u>Will the Riot Services stay the same? </u>\n<strong> (No.\nLike Kha\u2019zix, they will evolve.)</strong>\n<p>In an effort to constantly improve the Riot Services, evolve our games and keep the Riot Services, safe, fun, and secure, you agree that we may change, modify, update, suspend, \u201cnerf,\u201d or restrict your access to any features or parts of the Riot Services, including Virtual Goods (e.g., we might change some features of Virtual Goods for regulatory or legal reasons or to improve the game experience), and may require that you download and install updates to any software required to support the Riot Services, at any time without liability to you.\nYou also understand and agree that any such changes or updates to the Riot Services might change the system specifications necessary to play our games, and in such a case, you, and not Riot Games, are responsible for purchasing any necessary additional software or hardware in order to access and play our games.\nYou also understand and agree that we may use background patching to automatically update our games and software with or without notice to you.</p> 11.\nBOARDS AND LINKS 11.1.\n<u>Can I use the message boards?</u>\n<strong> (So long as you have a valid account and act maturely.)</strong>\n<p>If you have a valid, active account, you may use the boards section of our website or apps (the \u201c<strong>Boards</strong>\u201d) provided that you abide by the User Rules and any other posted rules.\nWe may revoke your access to the Boards at any time if we believe you have breached the User Rules.\nIf you think we have made a mistake, please Contact Us with details and we will review your case though your account may be suspended during our review.\nUse the Boards at your own risk.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor and police the Boards.\nWe aren\u2019t responsible for the content on the Boards.\nExcept in cases of our gross negligence or willful misconduct, we will have no liability to you for any harm you may experience by using the Boards.\n</p>\n11.2.\n<u>What about links in the Riot Services? Are those Safe?</u>\n<strong> (Like Bard\u2019s magical journeys, you might find something dangerous waiting for you on the other side.\nProceed with caution\u2026.)</strong>\n<p>The Riot Services may contain links to websites operated by other parties.\nAgain, we do not own or operate those other websites.\nWe provide these links to you as a convenience, or other users might be posting these links as user-provided content.\nUse these links and the corresponding external websites at your own risk.\nWe don\u2019t control the linked sites, and we\u2019re not responsible for the content available there.\nSuch links don\u2019t imply our endorsement of info or material on any other site, and we disclaim all liability with regard to your access to and use of such linked websites.</p> 12.\nNOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT 12.1.\n<u>What should I do if someone is infringing my copyrighted work in the Riot Services?</u>\n<strong> (Send us a copyright take-down notice.)</strong>\n<p>Riot Games respects copyright law and expects its users to do the same.\nIt is our policy to terminate accounts in appropriate circumstances of users who infringe or are believed to infringe the rights of copyright holders.\nRiot Games will respond expeditiously to claims of copyright infringement committed using the Riot Games website or other online network accessible through a mobile device or other type of device (the \u201c<strong>Sites</strong>\u201d) that are reported to Riot Games\u2019 Designated Copyright Agent, identified in the sample notice below.\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a copyright owner, are authorized to act on behalf of one, or authorized to act under any exclusive right under copyright, please report alleged copyright infringements taking place on or through the Sites by submitting a notice that contains all of the following: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed, or - if multiple copyrighted works are covered by this Notice - you may provide a representative list of the copyrighted works that you claim have been infringed.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Identify the material that you claim is infringing (or to be the subject of infringing activity) and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material, including at a minimum, if applicable, the URL of the link shown on the Site(s) where such material may be found.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Provide your mailing address, telephone number, and, if available, email address.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Include both of the following statements in the body of the Notice: <ul>\n<li>\u201cI hereby state that I have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., as a fair use).\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cI hereby state that the information in this Notice is accurate and[, under penalty of perjury,]* that I am the owner, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of the copyright or of an exclusive right under the copyright that is allegedly infringed.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<br>\n<li>Provide your full legal name and your electronic or physical signature.</li>\n</ol> * <i>You only need to include this language if you live in the United States of America.</i>\n<p>Deliver this notice (\u201c<strong>Notice</strong>\u201d), with all items completed, to Riot Games\u2019 Copyright Agent to the address of the Riot Games entity responsible for providing the Riot Services in your region (see Section 19).\nBe sure to mark it \u201cAttn: Copyright Agent\u201d (and not \u201cAttn: Legal Dept) so it gets to the right person quickly.\nYou can send your Notice instead by email to: copyright@riotgames.com.\nThis email address is intended solely for the receipt of copyright take-down notices and not for general inquiries or requests of Riot Games.\nAttachments cannot be accepted at the email address for security reasons.\nAccordingly, any Notice submitted electronically with an attachment will not be received or processed.</p>\n<p>Please note that the Notices are legal notices and that Riot Games may provide copies of such notices to the participants in the dispute or to third parties, at its discretion or as required by law.\nUpon receipt of such a Notice, Riot Games will take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate, including removal of the challenged material from the Sites.</p> 13.\nWARRANTY DISCLAIMER 13.1.\n<u>Does Riot make any warranties about the Riot Services? </u>\n<strong> (It depends where you are - prepare for some more lawyer shouting!)</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>You assume all responsibility for the installation and use of, and results obtained from the Riot Services (no matter where you are based).</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Also, if you are based in <strong>North, Central or South America</strong>:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>The Riot Services are provided to you on an \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cas available\u201d basis without warranties or representations of any kind, express or implied.\nYou assume all responsibility for your use of the Riot Services.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Riot Games disclaims all warranties, express or implied, which might apply to the Riot Services, including implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, any warranties that may arise from course of dealing, course of performance or usage of trade, and any warranties as to the accuracy, reliability or quality of any content or info contained within the Riot Services.\n</u>\n</strong>\n</p> 14.\nINDEMNIFICATION 14.1.\n<u>If someone sues Riot based on my use or misuse of the Riot Services, do I have to pay for Riot\u2019s legal expenses?</u>\n<strong> (Yes.)</strong>\n<p>To the extent permitted by law, except in cases involving our gross negligence or willful misconduct, you hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Riot Games and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers and directors from and against any and all claims, lawsuits, losses, liabilities and costs that arise or result from your misuse of the Riot Services, any violation by you of any of the provisions of these Terms (for example, if you use any hacks, cheats or bots with the Riot Services or you infringe our IP rights), or any infringement by you of any third party\u2019s rights.\nRiot Games reserves the right, at its own expense and in its sole and absolute discretion, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you\u2019ll cooperate with Riot Games in asserting any available defenses.</p>\n<p>For example, if you use the Riot Services as part of a business operation (something you\u2019re not allowed to do) and we get sued because of something you do in breach of these Terms, you\u2019ll have to defend us in court and pay for any damages we incur.</p> 15.\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY 15.1.\n<u>Is there a limit on Riot\u2019s potential liability under these Terms?</u>\n<strong> (Yes.)</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>To the extent permitted by law, our total liability to you (whether for breach of this contract, negligence or for any other reason whatever) for any loss, harm or damage suffered by you in connection with your downloading, use and/or access of the Riot Services is limited to the total amounts paid by you to Riot during the six (6) months immediately prior to the time your cause of action first arose.</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>We only make the Riot Services available for domestic and private use.\nWe are not liable for business losses (such as any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, loss of goodwill or loss of business opportunity).\nWe also won\u2019t have responsibility for any damage which arises because you failed to install any update when it is made available by Riot Games or where you fail to maintain the minimum system specifications required.\nSeparately, we are not responsible for: (i) any loss that was not foreseeable at the time you entered into these Terms.\nor (ii) any loss that we both knew might happen only because of your special circumstances existing at the time you entered into these Terms (including all indirect damages).</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Despite anything else we say in these Terms, WE DO NOT EXCLUDE OR LIMIT IN ANY WAY OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL TO DO SO, including our liability for: (i) death or personal injury arising from our negligence.\n(ii) our fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.\n(iii) willful or grossly negligent behavior.\n(iv) for damage arising from a negligent breach of an obligation that is essential for the performance of the contract by Riot Games (\u201cCardinal Duties\u201d) to the extent that is typical and foreseeable.\n(v) for any guarantee given by us to you.\nor (vi) for any liability under a jurisdiction\u2019s applicable product liability legislation.</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>You may also have specific rights under local law in addition to those set out above.</u>\n</strong>\n</p> 16.\nGOVERNING LAW 16.1.\n<u>What law applies to these Terms or if we get into a dispute?</u>\n<strong> (That depends on where you live and what Riot Games entity provides you with Riot Services.)</strong>\n<p>Please review below to determine what law applies to your use of the Riot Services.\nIrrespective of this choice-of-law, you may have the benefit of other or additional mandatory rights or remedies provided by local law in addition to those set out in these Terms.\nNothing in these Terms limits or affects those rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>If you live in North, Central or South America (excluding Brazil)</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these Terms will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act with respect to Section 17 \u201cDispute Resolution,\u201d and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\nExcept as otherwise expressly set out in Section 17 \u201cDispute Resolution,\u201d the exclusive jurisdiction for all disputes that you and Riot Games are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Los Angeles County, California, and you and Riot Games each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>If you live in South Korea</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be governed by the laws of Korea.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>If you live in Japan</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be governed by the laws of Japan.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>If you live in Singapore, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Cambodia (\u201cSEA\u201d)</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be governed by the laws of Singapore.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>If you live in the European Economic Area, UK, Brazil or any country that isn\u2019t listed in this Section 16 </em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms and any action arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of Ireland, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p> 17.\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION 17.1.\n<u>I have an issue that I haven\u2019t been able to sort out with Riot Games.\nWhat\u2019s the path to resolving this dispute?</u>\n<strong> (That depends on where you live)</strong>\n<p>If you live in: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>North, Central or South America (except for Brazil)</strong>, you\u2019ll be contracting and dealing with Riot Games Inc.\nand you need to read Part A (General Dispute Resolution Terms) and Part B of this Section;</li>\n<br>\n<li>\n<strong>South Korea</strong>, you\u2019ll be contracting and dealing with Riot Games Korea Limited and you need to read Part A (General Dispute Resolution Terms) and Part C of this Section;</li>\n<br>\n<li>\n<strong>Japan</strong>, you\u2019ll be contracting and dealing with Riot Games, LLC and you need to read Part A (General Dispute Resolution Terms) and Part D of this Section.\n</li>\n<br>\n<li>\n<strong>SEA</strong>, you\u2019ll be contracting and dealing with Riot Games Services PTE.\nLTD.\nand you need to read Part A (General Dispute Resolution Terms) and Part E of this Section.\nor</li>\n<br>\n<li>\n<strong>The European Economic Area, UK, Brazil or any other region/country that isn\u2019t listed above</strong>, you\u2019ll be contracting and dealing with Riot Games Limited and you need to read Part A (General Dispute Resolution Terms).\nIf you are based in the EU, Part F of this Section will also apply.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>\n<em>Part A: General Dispute Resolution (no matter where you live)</em>\n</strong> 17.2.\n<u>If we have a dispute, can we 1 v 1 instead?</u>\n<strong> (No, we should negotiate first.)</strong>\n<p>Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties (justice doesn\u2019t come on swift wings outside Valoran).\nIn an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to these Terms (\u201c<strong>Claim</strong>\u201d), you and Riot Games agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days (except as set out in Section 17.4 below).\n</p>\n17.3.\n<u>How does negotiation get started?</u>\n<strong> (One of us sends the other one a written notification describing the situation and relief sought.)</strong>\n<p>Riot Games will send its notice to the email address associated with your account.\nIf you don\u2019t have an account with Riot Games, we will send the notice to the email address which you used to write to us about the Claim.\nYou must send your notice to the Riot Games entity that is responsible for providing the Riot Services to you (see Section 19 for contact details).\nPlease note that this informal resolution procedure does not suspend any statutory limitation periods applicable to the bringing of a Claim.</p>\n17.4.\n<u>What claims are we agreeing to submit to negotiation?</u>\n<strong> (Depends on the type of dispute)</strong>\n<p>To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law and without limiting your statutory rights to initiate a court proceeding, you and Riot Games agree that the following Claims are not subject to the other provisions in this Part A concerning negotiations: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Riot Games\u2019 intellectual property rights.\n(ii) any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use.\nand (iii) any Claim for equitable relief (such as an injunction).\nIn addition, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts\u2019 jurisdiction instead of litigation.</p>\n<strong>\n<em>Part B: Dispute Resolution for North, Central or South America (excluding Brazil)</em>\n</strong> 17.5.\n<u>What the heck is arbitration?</u>\n<strong> (A private dispute resolution method.\nNo courtrooms or juries.)</strong>\n<p>Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process in which the parties agree to have their disputes decided by a neutral third party and not by a sitting judge or jury.\nArbitration allows parties to resolve their disputes privately and without the formality of going to court.\nArbitration follows different procedural rules than a court would, and is subject to very limited review by courts.</p>\n17.6.\n<u>Will arbitration allow for the same type of relief as a court?</u>\n<strong> (Yes.)</strong>\n<p>The arbitrator shall have the power to award any type of legal or equitable relief that would be available in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision (called an \u201c<strong>Award</strong>\u201d) will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim and provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the Award is based.\nThe Award will be final and binding upon the parties, may be confirmed by a court of competent jurisdiction, and then enforced like any other court order or judgment.</p>\n17.7.\n<u>What claims are we agreeing to submit to arbitration?</u>\n<strong> (Almost everything.)</strong>\n<p>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or related to these Terms or the Riot Services shall be resolved exclusively by private, binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that qualifying small claims may be submitted in small claims court and either party may seek emergency, provisional relief before the appointment of an arbitrator as specified in Section 17.14, below.\nThis means that, except for qualifying small claims actions and emergency situations covered by Section 17.14 below, <strong>you and Riot Games each waive the right to bring such claims to court, including the right to a jury trial</strong>.</p>\n17.8.\n<u>Can I bring a class or collective action claim? </u>\n<strong> (No.\nSorry for more lawyer-shouting, but this is very important.)</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>You and Riot Games agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding.\nUnless both you and Riot Games agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person\u2019s or party\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.\nAlso, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party\u2019s individual claim(s).</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n17.9.\n<u>What issues will the arbitrator decide?</u>\n<strong> (Pretty much everything.)</strong>\n<p>The arbitrator shall decide all issues in dispute between you and Riot Games.</p>\n17.10.\n<u>Who will administer the arbitration?</u>\n<strong> (JAMS, using its \u201cComprehensive Arbitration Rules.\u201d)</strong>\n<p>The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\u201c<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>\u201d).\nA sole arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to these rules.\nJudgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\n</p>\n17.11.\n<u>How does arbitration get started?</u>\n<strong> (One of us sends the other one and JAMS a written notification describing the situation and relief sought.)</strong>\n<p>Either party may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nThe party commencing the arbitration is called the \u201cclaimant.\u201d A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party.\nJAMS provides a form Demand for Arbitration on its website.\n</p>\n17.12.\n<u>Who\u2019s gonna pay for the arbitration?</u>\n<strong> (We pay filing fees for lesser claims, but you have to pay filing fees for larger claims.\nWe won\u2019t seek attorney fees for arbitration from you unless your claim is

including injunctive or similar relief, pursuant to the JAMS rules or from a court of competent jurisdiction located in Los Angeles County, California, where necessary to protect that party\u2019s rights and interests for the infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights pending the appointment of an arbitrator.</p>\n17.15.\n<u>Can either of us tell our friends and Twitter followers about the arbitration?</u>\n<strong> (Nope.)</strong>\n<p>You and Riot Games agree that any dispute, claim or controversy that has been submitted to arbitration, and all related proceedings

can be enforced under the law.)</strong>\n<p>You and Riot Games agree that if any part of this arbitration agreement is declared unenforceable, that part shall be severed and the remainder of this arbitration agreement shall be given full force and effect.\nHowever, if Section 17.8, above (entitled, \u201cCan I bring a class action claim?\u201d), or any part of it is found to be unenforceable, then this entire arbitration agreement (i.e., all of Part A of Section 17) shall be severed from these Terms and all claims between you and Riot Games shall be exclusively decided by a court located in Los Angeles County, California as set out in the relevant part of Section 16 above.</p>\n<strong>\n<em>Part C: Dispute Resolution for South Korea</em>\n</strong>\n<p>Any dispute arising under these

remedies are available to Riot Games if I breach these Terms?</u>\n<p>You agree that Riot Games would suffer irreparable harm if a breach of certain of these Terms (such as Section 3.2) was not

Terms might lose a part or two, but what\u2019s left lives on.)</strong>\n<p>Except as otherwise provided in these Terms, if any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be considered severed from these Terms and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect.</p>\n20.11.\n<u>Are these silly headings legally binding?
