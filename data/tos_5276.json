us first and attempt to work it out amicably.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\nFor residents of the United States, you agree to the following mandatory arbitration provisions:<br>\nMandatory Arbitration: If we\u2019re unable to work out a solution amicably, both you and Dharati Whole Foods agree to final and binding arbitration as the sole method of resolving any disputes, claims, or causes of actions arising out of your use of the Services or these Terms.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR NON-PAGA REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (COLLECTIVELY \u201cCLASS ACTION WAIVER\u201d).\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS ARBITRATION.\nYOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Dharati Whole Foods ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<br>\nIn any lawsuit in which (1) the complaint is filed as a class action, collective action or non-PAGA representative action.\nand (2) the civil court of competent jurisdiction in which the complaint was filed finds the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable (and such finding is confirmed by appellate review if review is sought), the Class Action Waiver shall be severable from this Agreement and in such instances, the class action, collective action and/or non-PAGA representative action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not as a class, collective or non-PAGA representative arbitration.<br>\nPAGA WAIVER: TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, THERE WILL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT, HEARD, OR ARBITRATED ON A GROUP BASIS OR IN ANY ACTION IN WHICH A PARTY SEEKS TO REPRESENT OTHER INDIVIDUAL(S) IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION (\u201cPAGA WAIVER\u201d).\nPAGA CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.<br>\nIn any lawsuit in which (1) the complaint is filed as a private attorney general action seeking to represent any individual(s) other than the named plaintiff.\nand (2) the civil court of competent jurisdiction in which the complaint was filed finds the PAGA Waiver is unenforceable (and such finding is confirmed by appellate review if review is sought), the PAGA Waiver shall be severable from this Agreement and in such instances, the private attorney general action must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not as a private attorney general arbitration.\nNotwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement, any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver or PAGA Waiver is invalid, unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nThe Class Action Waiver and PAGA Waiver shall be severable when a dispute is filed as an individual action and severance is necessary to ensure that the individual action proceeds in arbitration.<br>\nOpt-out of Mandatory Arbitration: You can decline this mandatory arbitration provision within 30 days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at&nbsp;support@dharatiwholefoods.com with your first and last name and stating your intent to opt-out of the arbitration provision.\nNote that opting out of this arbitration provision does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.<br>\nArbitration Procedures and Location: The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Rules in effect at the time the arbitration demand is made.\nThe current rules, effective July 1, 2014, can be found here: http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.\nJAMS arbitration rules can be found here: http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-clauses/.\nIn the event of any conflict between the rules and this Agreement, this Agreement shall apply.\nThe Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of a single neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Rules.<br>\nThe arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, California, or any other location we mutually agree upon in writing.<br>\nArbitration Fees: The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees and each party will be responsible for their own fees under those rules.\nHowever, Dharati Whole Foods will pay for your reasonable arbitration fees for claims: (a) where the claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, and (b) are not frivolous under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).\nDharati Whole Foods will not seek attorneys' fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).<br>\nExceptions to Mandatory Arbitration: Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.\nFor such claims, both parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Santa Clara County, California.<br>\n<br>\n7.\nTermination<br>\nYou can stop using the Services at any time and without notice to us.\nSimilarly, we may terminate access to the Services to you or any other users or stop offering the Service at any time without notice.\nIn the event of Termination, Section 1 and Sections 4-14 survive and continue to apply to you.<br>\n<br>\n8.\nControlling Law<br>\nThese Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflicts of laws principles.\nAny claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or use of the Services that are not subject to Section 7 (Disputes &amp.\nArbitration) of these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and you and Dharati Whole Foods consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.<br>\n<br>\n9.\nEntire Agreement &amp.\nSeverability<br>\nThese Terms, subject to any amendments, modifications, or additional agreements you enter into with Dharati Whole Foods, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Dharati Whole Foods with respect to the Services and any use of the Services.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by a court competent jurisdiction, that provision only will be limited to the minimum extent necessary and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>10.\nDelivery and Store pick-up</p>\n<p>We make our best attempts to deliver in customer selected time windows, in exceptional cases there may be delays in delivery due

to that provision, any other provision, or these Terms as a whole.<br>\n<br>\n13.\nAssignment<br>\nYou may not assign any of your rights, licenses, or obligations under these Terms.\nAny such attempt at assignment by you shall be void.\nDharati Whole Foods may assign its rights, licenses, and obligations under these Terms without limitation.<br>\n<br>\n14.\nChanges to the Terms<br>\nWe may make changes to these Terms from time to time.\nWhen we do so, we will post the most current version of the Terms on our website.\nBy continuing to use or access the Services after the revised Terms come
