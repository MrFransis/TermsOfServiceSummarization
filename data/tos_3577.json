\"<strong>Service</strong>\") are brought to you by Readdle, Inc.\n(the \"<strong>Data Controller</strong>\" of your personal data).\nConsequently, \"<strong>We</strong>\", \"<strong>Us</strong>\" and \"<strong>Ours</strong>\" refers to the Data Controller.</p> 2.\nInformation we collect and how we use this information <p>We collect certain information about you when you provide it directly to us or use our App and Service.\nWe only obtain information necessary to provide you with our services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Email address:</strong> As an email client, the core functionality of our Product is based on providing you with the ability to manage your email.\nFor this reason, Spark services access your email account when you start using the App.\nYour email address is a unique identifier of you as a user within our system and allows us to secure your data.\nYour email address will also be used as a primary means of communication for us on anything related to changes to the App and Service such as Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, or core functionality of our App or Service.\nWe may also occasionally contact you for marketing purposes and it will be in our legitimate interests to do so, but you will always have a chance to opt out of such marketing communications for similar products and/or services anytime.\nYour email is safe and we do not use it for profiling or targeting.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>OAuth login or mail server credentials:</strong> Spark requires your credentials to log into your mail system in order to receive, search, compose and send email messages and other communication.\nWithout such access, our Product won\u2019t be able to provide you with the necessary communication experience.\nIn order for you to take full advantage of additional App and Service features, such as \u201csend later\u201d, \u201csync between devices\u201d and where allowed by Apple \u2013 \u201cpush notifications\u201d we use Spark Services.\nWithout using these services, none of the features mentioned above will function.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Identity of a team you join:</strong> To make Spark Services possible, we allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service.\nIt allows you to have a secure space where you share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts, private discussions, or create links to a specific email message.\nTeam identity is necessary in order to associate you with that specific team as well as secure your information from people who are not a part of your team.\nOur system creates a record about the team only when you create one.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Email content while using Spark Services:</strong> We allow you and your colleagues to create teams within the Service.\nIt allows you to have a secure space where you share information such as email conversations, shared email drafts, have private discussions, or create links to specific emails.\nThis information is stored on our secure servers in order to make Services available to you, so you can collaborate with your teammates around email.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IP address:</strong> Core functionality of our Product is based on connection to the Internet.\nThat is why our App and Service won\u2019t properly function without Internet connection.\nYour IP address is a unique identifier that lets you connect to the Internet and our service will log connections for security and troubleshooting purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>APNS device token (Apple Push Notification Service):</strong> Push notifications allow you to get immediate updates about new emails or private team comments in your email inbox.\nYou\u2019re free to enable or disable them during initial App setup or later using your device\u2019s system preferences.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>App token assigned by us:</strong> This token allows us to identify your device in our system and troubleshoot potential issues you might experience.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Device, App version, iOS version information:</strong> We need to have this information so the App functions properly on your specific device.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Statistical information with regards to App usage:</strong> In order to better understand general app usage patterns, improve the Product and its user experience, Spark collects general statistical information about the usage of the Product.\nCollecting such data helps us optimize the App in future updates and such usage does not affect your rights and freedoms and does not disclose any personal data of yourself or your contacts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Recently accessed email messages, collaboration threads and shared inboxes:</strong> We need this information to provide Spark Services to you and your teammates such as private discussions around email, shared drafts, shared email conversations and shared inboxes.\nBy collecting and storing this data, we are able to present message discussion threads through your Spark app and provide better communication experience with your team.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Some of your email contacts:</strong> Spark Smart Notifications will send you push notifications only for important messages from real people.\nTo block push notifications for promotional newsletters and automatic emails, we need to keep the \u201cwhitelist\u201d of senders for push notifications.\nWe\u2019ll sync this \u201cwhitelist\u201d of contacts to our server to enable Smart Notifications.\nIf you decide not to use Smart Notifications, we will never sync your email contacts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Logs:</strong> We collect this information to prevent fraud and potential unauthorized access to your personal information, ensuring the technical availability and security of the App.\nThe server that hosts the App may record requests your device makes to the server, the details on device and browser you use, your IP address, date and time of access, city and country, operating system, browser type, mobile network information.\nThis data is used only for technical purposes \u2013 that is, to ensure the proper functioning and security of the App and to investigate possible security incidents.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookie information:</strong> This information is necessary for the Spark for Teams administration portal.\nCookies allows us to identify you as a member of the team and prevent unauthorized access to your team administration portal by other users.\nAll of this information is stored locally on your device.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customer Support communication:</strong> Regarding the email: we save a record of communication including attachments and information you voluntary decide to share with us

<p>Your personal data is used to provide you our App and Services, and to improve the Product.\nYour personal data is not used for marketing purposes.\nWe encrypt your emails and then store some of your personal data on secure servers that would prevent unauthorized access or destruction.\nUnless you have asked us not to, We may rarely contact you by email about similar products and services to the App.\nWhenever We contact you, We would always give you the right to opt out at any time (see the section \"<strong>Your Rights</strong>\" below).</p>\n<p>As stated in section 2 above, We only process personal data for the purposes strictly necessary to provide you with the service.\nSome of the purposes for processing the data provided by you include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing you with the services</li>\n<li>Fraud prevention</li>\n<li>Improving our services</li>\n<li>Notifying you of any changes in our services</li>\n</ul> 4.\nHow long personal data is stored for <p>Depending on the type, your personal data is stored either until you delete the App or after a certain period.</p>\n<strong>Type of information</strong>\n<strong>Length of storage</strong> Email address, email content for Spark Services, mail server credentials, APNS device token, App token assigned by us, device info 3 months after deletion of your email account from Spark on all devices Recent messages from your inbox Deleted after 4 hours Emails pending in the \"send later\" feature, IP addresses Deleted once the message is sent Emails of Shared Inboxes Deleted once the Shared Inboxes are deleted.\n5.\nSecurity measures used by Us <p>Your data is stored on secure servers that we rent and We use the recommended industry practices to keep your data secure.\nWe use appropriate level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.</p>\n<p>For instance, We ensure that all transmission is secured with HTTPS so that no one else can access your data.\nYour email and account credentials are stored on secure cloud-based servers using symmetric encryption.\nWe currently use Hetzner and Google (the \"<strong>Hosting providers</strong>\").\nThose Hosting providers are in possession of various international security certificates that ensure safety of your data with them.\nYou can read more on the security measures of Google, for instance, by following the link: https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/</p>\n<p>We use appropriate level of technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.\nA non-exhaustive list of such measures include:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nProtective measures for physical access control:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We secure access to the premises via ID readers, so that only authorised persons have access.\nThe ID cards can be blocked individually.\naccess is also logged.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, an alarm system is installed in the premises, preventing infiltration by unauthorised persons.\nThe alarm system is linked to a locking mechanism for the doors.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nProtective measures for system access control:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each employee has access to the systems/services only via his/her own employee access.\nThe access rights involved are limited to the responsibilities of the respective employee and/or team.</p>\n<p>We regulate access to our own systems via password procedures and the use of SSH keys of at least 4096 bits in length.\nThe SSH keys strengthen the productive systems against attacks that target weak passwords, as the password-based access to the relevant systems is disabled.</p>\n<p>We have, in addition, a regulation for the creation of passwords.\nThis guarantees higher security also for systems that offer password-based access.</p>\n<p>Passwords must meet the following requirements:<br>\nAt least 8 characters long<br>\nAt least 1 letter in upper-case<br>\nAt least 1 letter in lower-case<br>\nAt least 1 number<br>\nAt least 1 non-alphanumeric character</p>\n<p>Our systems are protected by firewalls that reject all incoming connections by default.\nOnly connection types defined by exception are accepted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nProtective measures for data access control:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All servers and services are subject to continuous monitoring.\nThis includes the logging of personal access in the user interface.</p>\n<p>Due to the close proximity of the employees, a visual inspection is possible at any time.</p>\n<p>Locking and/or logging off when leaving work is prescribed and is practised.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nProtective measures for transfer control:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The handling of local data storage devices, e.g.\nUSB sticks, is regulated via agreements.</p>\n<p>Access to the systems from outside the company network is possible only via secure VPN access.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nProtective measures for input control:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our employees do not work directly at database level, but instead use applications to access the data.</p>\n<p>IT employees access the system via individual access and use a common login.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nProtective measures for availability control:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We ensure the availability of data in several ways.\nOn the one hand, there is regular backup of the entire system.\nThis steps in if the other availability measures fail.</p>\n<p>Critical services are operated redundantly in multiple data centres and controlled by a high-availability system.</p>\n<p>Our workstations are also protected with the usual measures.\nFor example, virus scanners are installed, laptops are encrypted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nProtective measures for separation control:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To separate data, We use logically separate databases so that no accidental reading of data by unauthorised persons can occur.</p>\n<p>Access to the data itself is also restricted by the fact that employees use services (applications) which control access.</p> 6.\nCategories of recipients and Data Processors <p>We do not rent, sell or share your personal data with any third parties, except where We have to comply with Our legal obligation.\nSome of the data of our users is aggregated for statistical purposes and processed in the legitimate interests as stated in section 2 above.</p>\n<p>This does not mean that We blindly follow disclosure orders.\nWe will check each request to ensure it satisfies the relevant safeguards, contains a court order or is issued under a legislative measure for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences.\nIf We employ a processor to act on our behalf, We ensure that there are adequate contractual measures to ensure responsibility, security and liability to the same level as expected of Us.</p>\n<p>In any case where a third party accesses your data on our behalf or upon our instructions (be it inside or outside the EEA), We use the relevant legal basis to comply with the data protection legislation.\nIn cases where there is no finding of an adequacy decision by the European Commission, we use model contracts approved by the European Commission to safeguard your rights and data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical implementation of the services by subcontractors</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We partly use service providers who process Personal Data on behalf of us to operate the technical platform for the Services (for example, the documents that you scan and upload via the App are hosted by a third party hosting provider (whereas the respective servers are exclusively situated in EU member states)).\nThese service providers process the data exclusively according to our instructions (order processing).\nThe legal basis for the data processing described in this section 4 is Art.\n6 (1) sentence 1 lit.\nb GDPR (performance of contract and pre-contractual measures) and Art.\n28 GDPR (order processing).</p> 7.\nYour rights <p>Spark is a subject of various data privacy regulations including the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act.\nYou are entitled to the full spectrum of the rights under those regulations.\nWe will go out of our way to accommodate any valid request.\nYou can either exercise your rights by deleting your account and all information associated with it from your device or by emailing us at dpo@readdle.com.</p>\n<p>Spark under no circumstances sell your data and performs only lawful processing of your personal data, please see section 2 and 3 above for details.</p>\n<p>You have a wide array of rights that we respect.\nAmong those the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Require access to your personal data;</li>\n<li>Require rectification of your personal data (this is less relevant since otherwise we could not provide you with the service);</li>\n<li>Require erasure of your personal data;</li>\n<li>Withdraw consent to the processing of your personal data, where applicable, otherwise we could not provide you with the service;</li>\n<li>Lodge a complaint with your national supervisory authority (in the EEA) if you believe that your privacy rights have been breached.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The right to data portability is inapplicable with the App.\nYou should contact your email provider directly to request combined access to all of your personal data.\nIf your personal data is erased at your request or in accordance with our data retention policy, We only retain such information that is necessary to protect our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.</p> 8.\nCalifornia Residents Notice <p>In relation to paragraph (5), s.1798.130 of California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>following subparagraph (A) the list of consumer rights can be found in section 7 above;</li>\n<li>following subparagraph (B) personal information categories that We collect or have collected about consumers can be found in section 2 and 3 above;</li>\n<li>subparagraph (C) does not apply to our practices as We neither sell nor have in the past 12 months sold your personal information as described in subdivision (t) of s.1798.140 CCPA.</li>\n</ul> 9.\nChildren's privacy <p>We never knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone of 13 years and younger.\nThe App and its content are not directed at nor made look to appeal to such persons.\nParents or guardians that believe that We hold information about their children aged 13 and under may contact Us at dpo@readdle.com.</p> 10.\nOur commitment <ul>\n<li>We will only collect and use your data where We have a legal basis to do so;</li>\n<li>We will always be transparent and tell you about how we use your information;</li>\n<li>When We collect your data for a particular purpose, We will not use it for anything else without your consent, unless other legal basis applies;</li>\n<li>We will not ask for more data than needed for the purposes of providing our services;</li>\n<li>We will adhere to the data retention policies and ensure that your information is securely disposed of at the end of such retention period;</li>\n<li>We will observe and respect Your rights (in section 8 above) by ensuring that queries relating to privacy issues are dealt with promptly and transparently;</li>\n<li>We will keep our staff trained in privacy and security obligations;</li>\n<li>We will ensure to have appropriate technological and organizational measures in place to protect your data regardless of where it is held;</li>\n<li>We will also ensure that all of our data processors have appropriate security measures in place with contractual provisions requiring them to comply with Our commitment;</li>\n<li>We will obtain your consent and ensure that suitable safeguards are in place before personal data is transferred to other countries.</li>\n</ul> 11.\nChanges to the privacy policy <p>We will always notify you via email or otherwise should we update this privacy policy.\nWe will update the \"last modified\" date at the bottom of this privacy policy to indicate the latest revision, as well as the changes were made.</p> 12.\nContact Information <p>We are based outside the
