We know...reading the fine print isn't as fun as reading Shmoop's sparkling analysis about \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\" but please read through these carefully.</p>\n<p>This Terms of Use (this \u201cAgreement\u201d) constitutes a legally binding contract between Shmoop University, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201cShmoop,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d), and you

AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITE OR ANY OF THE SERVICES.</p> II.\nUpdates and Revisions <p>From time to time, Shmoop may need to update or revise this Agreement.\nThis may include revisions to reflect changes in our Services, changes in the law, or changes in our pricing and other terms.\nWe will call these \u201cModifications.\u201d We will notify Users of the Modifications by posting the updated Agreement on our Site and to the email address you provided when registering for the Services.\nYou agree that your continued use of the Site and Services after such Modifications are posted constitute your acceptance of such changes.\nYour sole recourse if you do not agree to the Modifications is to stop using the Site and the Services.</p>\n<p>In addition, unless explicitly stated otherwise, all new Shmoop and Shmoop-related products, services, tools, enhancements, and modifications to Shmoop are subject to this Agreement, unless otherwise stated on the Site.</p>\n<p>Shmoop reserves the right, at any time, and for any reason, from time to time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Shmoop Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice.\nUser acknowledges and agrees that Shmoop is not liable to User or any third party for such suspension, modification, or discontinuance.\nNothing in this Agreement shall be construed to obligate Shmoop to maintain and support the Site or Services, or any part or portion thereof, for any specific term.</p> III.\nShmoop's Services <p>Shmoop is an online provider of information, resources, guides, tools, and other related content about academic, social, and cultural topics.\nShmoop Services include, but are not limited to, the Heartbeat\u2122 tool, Learning Guides, Teaching Guides, Essay Lab, Test Prep, Courses, and Flashcards.\nThe Site and Services may include written, audio, video, photographic, artistic, and other content and material (collectively, \u201cShmoop Content\u201d).\nWe may add, remove, revise, suspend, terminate, or modify any of these Services or Shmoop Content at any time in our sole discretion.\nIf we add any Services, they will be subject to this Agreement, unless we state otherwise on our Site.</p> IV.\nUser Access and Equipment Requirements <p>To use the Services, a User must have an electronic device (such as a computer, tablet, or mobile device), an internet connection, and sufficient bandwidth to access and/or download Shmoop Content.\nUser is solely responsible for obtaining and operating and for all costs associated with the electronic equipment and internet connectivity required to access and use the Services.\nShmoop is not responsible for any problems, costs, or fees associated with any User\u2019s equipment or internet connectivity or any lack of bandwidth, including any faulty, erratic, or interruption in transmission of any Shmoop Content or Services.</p> V.\nRegistration and Access to Shmoop Services <p>You must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract to register and use the Site and Services.\nIf you are a minor in the jurisdiction where you live, you must have the consent of your parent or legal guardian to use the Site and Services.\nIf you are under 13 in the United States and under 16 in the European Union, we will need to obtain parental consent before we can let you register and use the Services.</p>\n<p>The Shmoop Services are provided from the United States and Shmoop makes no guarantees that its Services or the Shmoop Content is appropriate for use from locations outside the United States.\nFor those Users using Shmoop outside of the United States, the User is responsible for complying with any local laws in User\u2019s jurisdiction that might impact User\u2019s right to use the Services.\nUse of Shmoop in geographic areas in which such use is illegal is prohibited (and we reserve the right to exclude use of the Services from such jurisdictions).\nIn addition, a User may not use the Site if he or she is a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or is a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government.</p>\n<p>You must complete a registration form to register for and use the Services.\nIn connection with the registration or creation of a user account and profile as a Shmoop user, User must provide certain personal information to Shmoop, such as your name and email address.\nUser affirms that the personal information provided about User is correct, accurate, and true as of the time of registration or creation of the user profile.\nUser will update personal information on the Shmoop website on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>You will also need to create a username and password to access your account.\nWe call these your \u201cAccount Credentials.\u201d User is responsible for keeping the Account Credentials confidential and not sharing them with any other person, except that a parent may share Account Credentials with a child that has created an account through the parent.\nShmoop will not be held responsible for misuse or unauthorized use of User\u2019s Account Credentials.</p>\n<p>User may log in to a user account via a third party network, such as a sign-in through your Google account.\nIf User does so, User hereby authorizes Shmoop to pre-populate the relevant information fields of User\u2019s account and/or to use such third party network credentials to log User into the Site and Services.</p>\n<p>User can access or change User\u2019s personal profile and contact information or delete User\u2019s account through User\u2019s personal settings page.\nIf User chooses to delete or deactivate User\u2019s account, User can no longer retrieve his or her content or reactivate his or her account.\nAlso, User\u2019s username may become available for another person to use.\nHowever, unless prohibited by applicable law, information or data provided by User prior to deactivating User\u2019s account will remain accessible.</p> VI.\nPrivacy and Security\n<p>We collect, use, and disclose certain personal information from Users, including children, as set forth in Shmoop\u2019s Privacy Policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d).\nThis information is used to provide the Services to you and your child.\nIn the case of our Heartbeat tool, we are collecting responses to questions to assess a student\u2019s emotional, academic, and cognitive skills.\nIn some cases, your or your child\u2019s personal information, such as essays, answers to test questions, and responses to Heartbeat questions, might be shared with others, such as teachers, schools, and school districts if you are using the Shmoop Services through a School &amp.\nDistrict Plan (as defined below).</p>\n<p>Before using Shmoop Services, Shmoop encourages Users to review the Privacy Policy, which explains Shmoop\u2019s collection and use of personal information.\nBy using the Site and Services, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information under the Privacy Policy.\nPlease note that if you are located outside the United States, you agree that your personally identifiable information may be transferred to the United States, which may have less protections or offer less rights than your jurisdiction of residence.</p>\n<p>We also follow special procedures when collecting information from children.\nFor children in the United States that are under the age of 13, we follow the requirements of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d).\nIf you are a child under 13, you may not register an account for the Site without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian.\nConsistent with COPPA, Shmoop may ask for a User\u2019s age and if we determine a User is under the age of 13, we will ask for a parent or guardian\u2019s email address in order to obtain parental consent before Shmoop collects any personal information from the child.</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), consistent with the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), you may not register an account with the Site if you are under 16 without consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian.\nWe will follow a similar procedure for verifying parental consent for EU Users under 16 to the extent required and permitted under GDPR.</p>\n<p>If you, as the User, are a parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 13 in the United States or 16 in the EU, who you allow to access or use the Site and Services, you hereby give your express consent for that child to use the Site and Services, which includes all the features and functionality pertaining to your registration and subscriptions, including social media/community features.\nYou represent and warrant that you will not allow a child under the age of 13 (or 16 if you are a resident of the EU) to use the Site or Services if you do not agree to provide such express consent.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that Shmoop may choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that Shmoop deems necessary to validate your registration information.\nShmoop reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity.\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHMOOP CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU AND SHMOOP IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY YOUR IDENTIFY OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY YOU DURING REGISTRATION IS YOUR ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p> VII.\nSubscriptions, Payments, and Cancellations <br>\n<ol>\n<li>Subscriptions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Users may subscribe to access any of the Services offered through the Site.\nShmoop offers subscriptions for the Services on a paying basis (\u201cPaid Subscription\u201d):</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Paid Subscriptions: We charge a subscription fee for many of the Services on the Site.\nYou can pay for these Subscriptions on a monthly or annual basis (\u201cSubscription Term\u201d).\nThe Subscription Term starts on the date you register for the Service and for monthly subscriptions, ends at the end of each month or for annual subscriptions, ends at the end of the month one year after the initial registration.\nwe do not pro-rate for partial monthly or annual periods.\nFor example, if you started a monthly plan on September 15, 2020, the initial Subscription Term would end September 30, 2020.\nif you started an annual plan on September 15, 2020, the initial Subscription Term would end on September 30, 2021.\nIf you register for a Paid Subscription, we will ask you to provide a valid credit card for payment of the subscription fees.\nBy providing your credit card, you authorize us to charge your credit card the subscription fees on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the plan you selected.\n</li>\n<li> School &amp.\nDistrict Plans: Schools and school districts can contact Shmoop to arrange for a plan to be provided to students and teachers of that school or school district (\u201cSchool &amp.\nDistrict Plans\u201d).\nSuch plans are negotiated on an individual basis and subject to separate agreements, except that any authorized user under a School &amp.\nDistrict Plan must agree to this Agreement in using the Site and Services provided under that plan.\n</li>\n<li> Authorized Users: Any Paid Subscription may only be accessed by the User who has registered for that subscription and may not be transferred to any other person or User without the written permission of Shmoop, except a parent or legal guardian may allow the child that they have registered to access and use their Shmoop Account and Account Credentials to access the Services.\nIn the case of School &amp.\nDistrict Plans, the school or school district is responsible for designating the authorized Users.\nno person may use the Services under a School &amp.\nDistrict Plan without first being designated by the school or school district.\nThe number of authorized Users under any single Subscription may not exceed the number of permitted seats paid under that Subscription (\u201cMaximum Seats\u201d).\nIf an authorized User breaches this Agreement, Shmoop may terminate that authorized User\u2019s access to the Services.\nAny use of the Services by a User not authorized under this Agreement or in excess of Maximum Seats shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, entitling Shmoop to terminate access by that User.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Pricing and Payments</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Except in the case of School &amp.\nDistrict Plans, the fees (\u201cSubscription Fee\u201d) for Paid Subscriptions will be set forth on the page where you register for the Paid Subscription.\nShmoop may change the Subscriptions Fee for Paid Subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any such price changes to User.\nSubscription Fee changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next Subscription Term following the date of the price change.\nBy continuing to use the Shmoop Service after the Subscription Fee change takes effect, User accepts the new Subscription Fee (e.g., in the case of a monthly plan, the increase will take effect the following month.\nin the case of an annual plan, the increase will take effect on the next annual period).\nIf a User does not agree to the Subscription Fee change, it should cancel the subscriptions on the User\u2019s account before the end of the current Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>Our Paid Subscriptions renew automatically and so a User\u2019s payment to Shmoop for Subscription Fees will automatically renew at the end of each applicable Subscription Term, unless the Paid Subscription is cancelled by User through User\u2019s subscription page before the end of the current Subscription Term.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current Subscription Term However, if User cancels User\u2019s payment and/or terminates before the end of the Subscription Term, Shmoop will not refund any Subscription Fees already paid to Shmoop.\nSubscription Fees are non-refundable.</p>\n<p>User agrees to provide Shmoop with valid, up-to-date, and complete debit/credit card, contact, and billing details to make any payments for Paid Subscriptions.\nUser further authorizes Shmoop to bill such debit/credit card on activation of the Paid Subscription and on the renewal of each Subscription Term.\nIf, for any reason, User\u2019s credit/debit card company refuses to pay the amount billed for the Services, User agrees that Shmoop may, at its option, suspend or terminate User\u2019s subscription to the Services and require User to pay the overdue amount by other means acceptable to Shmoop.\nShmoop may charge a fee for reinstatement of suspended or terminated accounts.\nUser agrees that until its subscription to the Services is properly terminated, it will continue to accrue charges for which it remains responsible, even if it does not use the Services.\nIn the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances due, User agrees to reimburse Shmoop for all expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorney fees and other legal expenses.\nUnless otherwise expressly stated, all fees are stated in United States dollars.</p> VIII.\nAccess and Use of Shmoop Services <br>\n<ol>\n<li>User\u2019s Access and Use of Shmoop Services</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Provided a User is in compliance with this Agreement, including payment of all Subscription Fees, a User may access the Site, Services and any Shmoop Content provided on the Site, and the Services to which the User has subscribed for the User\u2019s personal, non-commercial use only.\nUser\u2019s access to Services and Shmoop Content shall be for the applicable Subscription Term for the Paid Subscription purchased by User.\nThe Services and Shmoop Content remain, at all times, the sole property of Shmoop or its third party licensors.\nAll rights in the Services and Shmoop Content not expressly granted to User by Shmoop under this Agreement are retained by Shmoop.</p>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Restrictions on Use</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Except as permitted hereunder, or as permitted as a fair use under copyright law, User shall not copy, create derivative works, redistribute, retransmit, publish, or commercially exploit any of the Services or any of the Shmoop Content, resources, or tools on the Site or Services, without express permission in writing of Shmoop and the copyright owner.\nShmoop strictly prohibits all commercial and/or unauthorized use of Services.\nUser acknowledges and agrees that User may not use or resell Services for any commercial purpose, including, but not limited to, sending unsolicited commercial messages.</p>\n<p>User acknowledges and agrees that no ownership rights are conferred or acquired by User upon download of any Shmoop Content.\nUser may not: (i) remove or alter any trademark, legends, symbols, labels, logos, copyright, or other proprietary notices on the Services or Shmoop Content.\nor (ii) reverse engineer, decompile, reverse assemble, or otherwise attempt to discover any source code or software used for the Services, except as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>User may not copy, frame, or mirror any part of the Site nor access the Services for purposes of monitoring its availability, performance, or functionality.\nUser also may not bypass the measures Shmoop may use to prevent or restrict access to the Site or the Shmoop Content, including, without limitation, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Site or the content therein.\nUser may not retrieve and store or archive in electronic form, or any other form, any material part of the databases underlying the Services.</p>\n<p>User may not use Services in any manner that could overburden, disable, damage, or otherwise impair the Services (e.g., User may not access Services in an automated manner by use of \u201cspiders,\u201d \u201crobots,\u201d or otherwise), nor may User use Services in any manner that could interfere with any other party\u2019s use and enjoyment of the Services.\nUser may not attempt to disrupt, degrade, impair, or violate the integrity or security of the Site or the computers, services, accounts, or networks of any other party (including, without limitation, \u201chacking,\u201d \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks, etc.), including any activity that typically precedes attempts to breach security, such as scanning, probing, or other testing or vulnerability assessment activity, or engaging in or permitting any network or hosting activity that results in the blacklisting or other blockage of Shmoop internet protocol space.\nUser may not execute any form of network monitoring or run a network analyzer or packet sniffer or other technology to intercept, decode, mine, or display any packets used to communicate between the Site\u2019s servers or any data not intended for User.</p>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Use and Storage of User Data and Content</li>\n</ol>\n<p>User agrees that Shmoop may establish general practices and limits concerning use of Shmoop Services, including, but not limited to, length of time User content is retained, volume of content or data that is stored, and the number of times and length of time a User may use the Services (collectively, \u201cAdditional Policies\u201d).\nUser agrees to abide by all such Additional Policies and that Shmoop may modify or alter these Additional Policies from time to time.\nIn addition, User agrees that Shmoop has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any messages, communications, performance data, and user-generated content maintained or transmitted by the Services.\nUser acknowledges and accepts that Shmoop retains the right to deactivate or terminate User profiles or accounts at its discretion for reasons including, but not limited to, inactivity or inappropriate activity.\n</p>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Plagiarism</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Shmoop reserves the right to provide its content to websites and services that will track whether User has plagiarized any Shmoop Content.\nShmoop takes plagiarism extremely seriously and has a right to terminate use and to take legal action against any User who plagiarizes from the Site or Services.\nPlagiarism is a serious offense and directly opposes the purpose of Shmoop, which is to assist in educating Users, and to promote a deep, rigorous, and enjoyable learning experience on topics covered by Shmoop.\nShmoop Content was not created to be a shortcut or opportunity to avoid class assignments, but rather, as a supportive companion in the learning process.</p>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Citing Shmoop</li>\n</ol>\n<p>User must cite Shmoop if he or she uses the Site as a source for a paper, class project, publication, or any other use.\nThe proper citation format for citing Shmoop is, by default, the citation convention appropriate for all websites.\nMore detailed information on citing Shmoop can be found here.</p> IX.\nUser-Generated Content (UGC) <p>Shmoop allows Users to post messages, comments, flashcards, questions, and discussions, and otherwise make available information generated by the User (collectively, \u201cuser-generated content\u201d or \u201cUGC\u201d).\nUsers may only submit UGC that has been created by User himself or herself, or that User has permission to submit and does not violate copyright, trademark, or any other rights of third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note:</strong> any UGC that you provide and any responses to test prep questions, essays, or response to Heartbeat questions may be viewed by other users of the Service, including teachers and schools if you are a User under a School &amp.\nDistrict Plan.\nWe cannot guarantee the confidentiality of any UGC or other responses or materials that you may provide in connection with the Services.</p>\n<p>Shmoop is not responsible for, nor does it claim ownership of, any UGC that any User posts to the Site through forums, message boards, blogs, or other features,

any provision in this Agreement is held unenforceable or illegal by an adjudicatory body of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable without altering its intent, or severed from this Agreement should no modification be possible, and the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.</p> XXII.\nHeadings

less than 13 years of age (\u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d) who use our Site or Services.\nThis policy explains our information collection, disclosure, and parental consent practices with respect to information provided by children and is in accordance with the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d).\nShmoop does not knowingly permit any child to register directly for the Site or Services unless we reasonably believe, or have received assurances from the subscribing user or in the case of use under a plan with an educational institution, the administrator, that the child\u2019s parent has consented to such registration and use of the Site and Services.\nIf Shmoop learns that personally identifiable information of a child has been collected on the Site without parental consent, then we will take appropriate steps to delete this information.\nIf you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has a registered account with the Site without your consent, please email Shmoop at support@shmoop.com and request that Shmoop delete that child's personally identifiable information from its systems.</p> Registration and Use of the Site\n<p>When a child requests to register for the Site or Services, Shmoop will seek consent from the child's identified parent or guardian (\u201cParent\u201d).\nWe may ask the child to provide certain information for notification and security purposes, including the Parent's email address, the child\u2019s first name and gender, the child\u2019s username, and password.\nWe may also ask for birth dates from children to validate their ages.\nPlease note that children can choose whether to share their information with us, but certain features cannot function without it.\nAs a result, children may not be able to access certain features if required information has not been provided.\nWe will not require a child to provide more information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in an online activity.\nParents may also agree to the collection and use of their child\u2019s information, but not allow disclosure to third parties.</p>\n<p>Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, on any child-targeted site or application, or in any instance where we ask for age and determine the user is less than 13 years of age, we will ask for a Parent email address before we collect any personally identifiable information from the child.\nIf you believe your child is participating in an activity that collects personally identifiable information and you or another Parent have NOT received an email providing notice or seeking your consent, please feel free to contact us at support@shmoop.com.\nWe will not use Parent emails provided for parental consent purposes to market to the Parent, unless the Parent has expressly opted in to email marketing or has separately participated in an activity that allows for such email contact.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a Parent and wish to provide direct consent for your child\u2019s registration on the Site and Services, you must first register through the Site and affirmatively verify you are the child\u2019s Parent and consent to the collection of the child\u2019s personally identifiable information.\n</p>\n<p>If, in addition to collecting content that includes personally identifiable information, Shmoop also plans to post the content publicly, share it with a third party for the third party\u2019s own use or allow the child to post content publicly, we will obtain a higher level of parental consent as required by COPPA (verifiable parental consent).\nMethods by which we will obtain verifiable parental consent include, but are not limited to, requiring a signed consent form by mail, fax or electronic scan, asking for a credit card or other online payment method for verification, or having the Parent speak to a trained customer service representative by telephone or video chat.\nWe will not post a child\u2019s personally identifiable information or content publicly or except as permitted by law or as stated in the section entitled \u201cWhen Information Collected From Children is Available to Others,\u201d share such personally identifiable information or content with a third party for their third party\u2019s own use without first obtaining verifiable parental consent.</p> Teacher or Administrator Consent <p>With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of personally identifiable information from children.\nSchools should always notify parents about these activities.</p> Email Contact with a Child <p>On occasion, and as permitted by COPPA, in order to respond to a question or request from a child, Shmoop may need to ask for the child\u2019s online contact information, such as an email address.\nShmoop will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.</p>\n<p>In connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a child\u2019s online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with the child more than once.\nIn such instances we will retain the child\u2019s online contact information to honor the request and for no other purpose such as marketing.\nWhenever we collect a child\u2019s online contact information for ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a Parent email address in order to notify the Parent about the collection and use of the child\u2019s information, as well as to provide the Parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.\nOn some occasions a child may be engaged in more than one ongoing communication, and a Parent may be required to \"opt-out\" of each communication individually.</p> Persistent identifiers: <p>When children interact with us, certain information may automatically be collected, both to make our Site and Services more interesting and useful to children and for various purposes related to our business.\nAs discussed in this Privacy Policy, examples include the type of computer operating system, the child\u2019s IP address or mobile device identifier, the web browser, the frequency with which the child visits various parts of our Site, and information regarding the online or mobile service provider.\nThis information is collected using technologies such as cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, and other unique identifiers (which we define under the \u201cCookies.\nDo Not Track\u201d section of this Privacy Policy).\nThis information may be collected by Shmoop or by third-party businesses for the purposes explained in the \u201cCookies.\nDo Not Track\u201d section of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>In the event we collect (or allow others to collect) such information from children on our Site or Services for other purposes, if required by COPPA, we will notify parents and obtain consent prior to such collection.</p> When Information Collected From Children is Available to Others <p>In addition to those instances where a child\u2019s personally identifiable information is posted publicly (after receiving verifiable parental consent), we also may share or disclose personally identifiable information collected from children in a limited number of instances, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may share information with our service providers if it is necessary for them to perform a technology support function for us, or for other legitimate educational purposes.</li>\n<li>We may disclose personally identifiable information if permitted or required by law, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, we also may disclose personally identifiable information collected from children (i) in response to a law enforcement or public agency\u2019s (including schools or children services) request.\n(ii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of a child using our Site.\n(iii) to protect the security or integrity of our Site, Services and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers.\nor (iv) enable us to take precautions against liability.\n</li>\n</ul> Parental Choices and Control <p>At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to use and collect further personally identifiable information from their children in association with a particular account, and can request that we delete from our records the personally identifiable information we have collected in connection with that account.\nPlease keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account, membership, or other service.</p>\n<p>Where a child has registered for a Shmoop account, we use two methods to allow Parents to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their children:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Parents can request access to and delete their child\u2019s personally identifiable information by logging onto the child\u2019s account.\nParents will need their child\u2019s username and password.</li>\n<li>Parents can contact us to request access to, change, or delete their child\u2019s personally identifiable information at support@shmoop.com.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In any correspondence such as email or mail, please include the child\u2019s username and the Parent\u2019s email address and telephone number.\nTo protect children\u2019s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify a Parent\u2019s identity before granting access to any personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>We will retain your child\u2019s information for as long as their account is active or as needed to provide them services.\nIf you wish to cancel your child\u2019s account or request that we no longer use that information to provide them Services, please contact us at support@shmoop.com.\nWe will retain and use their information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>\n<p>If we make material changes to how we use personally identifiable information collected from children, we will notify parents by email in order to obtain parental consent for the new uses of the child\u2019s personally identifiable information.</p> Our Communication with You <p> After you register with Shmoop, we may contact you in several ways.\nPlease see our contact us page to opt-out of specific types of messages.\n</p> Customer Service <p>When you register, we will send you a welcome message from

notifications by email.\nYou may opt-out from such communication on our Contact page or by using the unsubscribe mechanism in the email.</p> Service Announcements <p>TWe may send our users updates regarding the Service or their account.\nThese are sent to all registrants of Shmoop on occasions when a significant service change or disruption occurs.\nYou cannot opt-out of such Service-related or account-related emails.\n</p> Accessing, Changing and Managing Your Information\n<p>You can access or change your personal profile and contact information or delete your account by either logging into your account or contacting customer service at support@shmoop.com.\n</p> Security of Your Information <p>The security of your information is important to us.\nWe use a number of measures to help protect the security of the personally identifiable information submitted to us.\nHowever, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.\nTherefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and any information you transmit to Shmoop or submit through the Site or the Services is done so at your own risk.\nIf you have questions about security on our

the right to request that we limit the processing of your personally identifiable information: <ul>\n<li>while we are evaluating or in the process of responding to a request by you to update or
