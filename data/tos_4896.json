OmoOrg community, we expect you to know and adhere to all listed rules.\nWe take these policies seriously.\nSome offenses can result in account termination on the first offense.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp.\n</p> Unethical behavior <p>\nEngaging in or supporting unethical behavior is prohibited on OmoOrg.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consent is always required</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe strictly prohibit any of the following acts on OmoOrg.\n<strong>Violations may result in immediate account termination.</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nPosting or requesting videos recorded without a person\u2019s knowledge or consent.\nThis includes:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nNon-staged voyeur / hidden camera clips\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nCCTV footage\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nTrailing (i.e.\nstalking) individuals you do not know because they \u201cappear to be desperate\u201d\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nPosting or requesting altered photos without a person\u2019s consent\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nIntentionally involving non-consenting bystanders in your fetish.\nFor example:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nFlashing (exposing yourself)\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nWalking up to someone and wetting/soiling yourself just to gauge a persons reaction\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n&nbsp.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Vandalism is strictly prohibited</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Posting about or supporting events involving the destruction of private or public property will result in account suspensions and termination on repeat offense.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nSome examples of this include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nIntentionally urinating on theater seats, hotel beds, bus / plane seats, store furniture, or any other type of flooring within private property.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nPosting about <strong>genuine</strong> accidents is usually okay, provided you took all reasonable steps to avoid any of the above instances.\nGetting yourself desperate to the point you know you\u2019re going to have an accident and then conveniently wetting yourself on another person\u2019s property would not classify as an accident.\nIf it\u2019s premeditated, it\u2019s not an accident.\n</p>\n<p>\nPublic wettings on isolated concrete sidewalks, streets, parking lots, or other areas where no damage is caused and nature will clean the accidents itself are perfectly okay, so long as you stay within the above consent policies.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis can effectively be summarized as: don\u2019t force others to clean up your messes, or risk making others sit in your own accidents.\nIt\u2019s not only rude, but in cases of actual vandalism, it\u2019s illegal.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp.\n</p> Be respectful <p>\nMost of these policies go without saying.\n<strong>Simply put, don\u2019t be a jerk.</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nDevaluing someone just because you don\u2019t share their kinks or interests is not okay.\nWe are a community that embraces all sensible, open-minded individuals.\nIf it doesn\u2019t bring harm to anyone, there\u2019s not likely anything wrong with it.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nAttacking members with the use of racist, homophobic or transphobic slurs with the direct intent of demeaning them for being a part of said groups will result in immediate account termination.\nOmoOrg is an LGBT-friendly community.\nWe accept transgender people as they are here.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nOmoOrg is not a hook-up or camming service.\nAct appropriately when sending messages to other users.\nShow respect for an individual\u2019s privacy.\nIf they\u2019re not comfortable with something, back off.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nKeep in mind that your profile photo is displayed with every post you make, so it should be something that you want people to tie to your persona on the site.\nWhen people think of you, you probably don\u2019t want them to think of some a random crotch close-up.\nIn short, you can upload the lewd stuff in your topics/posts, but please keep your profile itself tame (i.e.\nno nudity).\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n&nbsp.\n</p> No posting or linking to content on the sites Do not Post list <p>\nContent by producers on OmoOrg\u2019s Do Not Post list should not be shared or requested anywhere on the site.\nThis includes being posted as file attachments, through the downloads system, or by providing third-party download/video links to files.\nWe adopt a copyright policy similar to many major streaming platforms on OmoOrg.\nRepeated offenses in a short time period will result in your accounts closure.\n</p>\n<p>\nAbuse of the personal messaging system to share said content will result in more severe account penalties and the permanent loss of your account\u2019s access to the personal messaging system.\n</p>\n<p>\nClick here to view an up-to-date version of OmoOrg\u2019s Do Not Post list\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp.\n</p> No unauthorized advertisements <p>\nOmoOrg is not to be exploited as a free advertising platform for off-site ventures without prior administrator approval.\nThis includes but is not limited to videos, streams which garner monetary value, and picture or art sets.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you wish to sell your content to the OmoOrg userbase, you may apply to be a part of our content platform by clicking here.\nFor advertising inquiries, you may contact us by clicking here.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp.\n</p> Fictional content policies <p>\nThese policies apply explicitly to <strong>fictional</strong> content (art, comics, literature) produced or otherwise shared on OmoOrg.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile we try to respect each individual\u2019s right to creative freedom as much as possible, as a private predominantly softcore community, we have some policies that must be adhered to.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Content containing any of the following should not be posted on OmoOrg:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nWorks that fetishize any forms of graphical violence or abuse (e.g.\nrape scenario\u2019s, physical abuse, etc.)\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nWorks that feature preadolescence children in any fetishized manner or otherwise involve them in sexually explicit situations\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nThis means works that depict and fetishize actual children.\nWriting fandom works of anime characters who visually appear to be adults, regardless of canonical age, is still allowed.\nConversely, writing works of characters that look and act like children but are canonically \u201c900 year old vampires\u201d would not be allowed.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIn some situations, we must apply moderator discretion.\nIf you are unsure about posting something, you are welcome to contact us beforehand for prior approval.\n</p>\n<p>\n&nbsp.\n</p>\n<em>Posting Guidelines</em>\n<p>\nPlease take the time to write thoughtful posts.\nAvoid making some of these common mistakes when taking part in the OmoOrg community:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nMaking a repeated number of consecutive short posts.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nUsing backgrounds or font colors which would be hard to see on either light or dark backgrounds.\nPlease remember that OmoOrg supports both a light and dark mode.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nUsing excessively large font sizes.\nLarger fonts should be reserved for headers, chapter titles, and so on.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nUse of ALL CAPS, clickbait, or other non-descriptive topic titles\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nBegging for reputation in posts is widely frowned upon and should always be avoided.\nReputation should be earned naturally without needing to ask for it.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n&nbsp.\n</p> OmoOrg Terms of Service (Legal Agreements) &nbsp.\nReveal hidden
