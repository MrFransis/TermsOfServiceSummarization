affiliates and parent companies (\u201c<strong>Zoom</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>we</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>us</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>our</strong>\u201d) is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when you use our video conferencing and communication services (the \u201cServices\u201d), visit our webpages, interact with us on social media, or attend a Zoom sponsored event offline or online.\n</p>\n<p> This Statement explains Zoom\u2019s practices when we process your \u201cpersonal data,\u201d which is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.\nTo \u201cprocess\u201d or \u201cprocessing\u201d means any use of personal data including, transferring, collecting, recording, storing, using, analyzing, combining, disclosing or deleting it.\n</p>\n<p> This Statement may be updated periodically.\nIf we plan to make any <strong>material</strong> changes to the way we handle personal data as described here, we will notify you by posting an updated version of this Statement on our website.\nChanges to this Statement are summarized in our Change Log.\nWe may supplement this Statement with \u201cjust-in-time\u201d notices, or other disclosures contained within or in connection with the provision of the Services, which may describe in more detail our data collection, use and sharing practices.\nUnless we say otherwise, such supplemental privacy statements will govern how we may process the information in the context of the specific product or service.\n</p> What this Statement Covers <p> This Statement applies to the personal data we process as a data controller, that is, as the party that determines what data to collect and why.\nYou provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with the Services.\nThe data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Zoom and the choices you make, including the products and features you use.\nWe also obtain data about you from third parties.\n</p>\n<p> When you use Zoom\u2019s Services through a Zoom account holder, such as your employer or school, the processing of your personal data is determined and administered by that account holder under its privacy policies.\nIf you have questions about how and why your personal data is collected, the legal basis for processing, or requests regarding your personal data, please refer to the account holder\u2019s privacy statement and direct your inquiries to the account holder or its administrator.\n</p> Supplementary Information Being Considered for a Job at Zoom <p> Please see our Candidate Privacy Statement for supplemental information on the personal data we process in connection with our recruiting efforts.\n</p> Your California Privacy Rights <p> If you are a resident of the State of California, this Privacy Statement is supplemented by our California Privacy Rights Statement that explains your California privacy rights and how you can exercise these rights.\n</p> Zoom for Government <p> The following section on Zoom for Government (ZfG) supplements this Privacy Statement.\nWhere terms differ, this section takes precedence.\n</p>\n<p> ZfG is hosted in the United States in a separate cloud authorized by FedRAMP and is accessible by way of a separate website (www.zoomgov.com).&nbsp.\nIf you use the ZfG service: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> All data collected about you while using the ZfG service or the ZfG website is stored in the United States of America.\n</li>\n<li> Your data is only processed by Zoom in accordance with FedRAMP \u201cmoderate impact level\u201d control standards.\n</li>\n<li> The sections in this Statement related to data handling outside the United States do not apply to the personal data collected by Zoom about you in connection with your use of the ZfG service or ZfG website.\n</li>\n<li> With regard to the Zoom App Marketplace, we do not allow third parties to use any personal data obtained from us for their own purposes, unless it is with your consent (e.g.\nwhen you download an app from the Zoom for Government Marketplace: https://marketplace.zoomgov.com/).\n</li>\n</ul> Zoom and Children <p> Zoom does not knowingly allow children under the age of 16 to sign up for their own accounts.\nPrimary and secondary schools or districts register to use Zoom\u2019s video communications platform through a \u201cK-12/Primary and Secondary Account.\u201d Please see Zoom\u2019s K-12/Primary and Secondary Privacy Statement for additional information.\nWhere terms differ, as with the limitations on advertising in K-12 Accounts, the K-12/Primary and Secondary Privacy Statement takes precedence.\n</p> Zoom App Marketplace &amp.\nOther Sites, Mobile Applications and Services <p> This Privacy Statement does not apply to any third-party applications or software that you elect to add to the Services (\u201cThird Party Services\u201d), or any other third-party websites, mobile applications, or online products, services or businesses you may access from the Services.\nWhen you download an App from the Zoom App Marketplace, for example, the app publisher provides its own terms of service, privacy policy and support information.\nPlease review that information carefully.\n</p> Personal Data We Process &amp.\nHow We Use It <p> The table below describes Zoom\u2019s processing of personal data as a data controller.\nThe table does not cover customer content, including any personal data about you that may be contained in customer content\u2014such as meeting or call recordings or transcripts\u2014because the customer (the Zoom account holder), rather than Zoom, controls how customer content is processed.\nAny questions about the processing of customer content should be addressed to the customer directly.\n</p>\n<p>Personal Data Processing</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Types of Personal Data </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Get It</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What we do with it</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Basis</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>[Applies only in the EEA, and only

Customer content is the \u201cin-session\u201d information you give us directly through your use of the Services, such as meeting recordings, files, chat logs, and transcripts, and any other information uploaded while using the Services.&nbsp;Zoom uses customer content only in connection with providing the Services \u2013 we do not monitor, sell or use customer content for any other purposes.\n</p>\n<p> We do not control the actions of anyone with whom you or any other Service user may choose to share information.\nTherefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that any customer content you or any user provides to the Services will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.\nNor can Zoom control the information a user may choose to share during a meeting.\nAlthough Zoom account holders can set privacy options that limit access to certain areas of the Services, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and that we are not responsible for circumvention of any security measures contained on the Services.\nYou should be cautious about the access you provide to others when using the Services, and the information you choose to share when using the Services.\n</p> Zoom\u2019s Product and Marketing Pages <p> Zoom generally processes personal data in two different manners using its websites and apps.\nFirst, Zoom processes personal data it obtains from the webpages or mobile application interfaces that Zoom uses to provide its Services, such as the landing page a user sees after clicking on a link to join a meeting (Zoom\u2019s \u201cProduct Pages\u201d).\nProduct Pages also include webpages and links that are only accessible to a Zoom account holder after they login to their Zoom account.\nProduct Pages serve only third-party cookies that are necessary for technical support and to deliver the service.\nThere are no interest-based advertising cookies on Product Pages.\n</p>\n<p> Second, Zoom processes personal data obtained from its webpages that are accessible without logging in to a Zoom account (Zoom\u2019s \u201cMarketing Pages\u201d).\nMarketing Pages, such as www.zoom.us, are designed to encourage sales of Zoom subscriptions.\nThey tell you about our product, plans, and pricing, features, and other related information.\n</p>\n<p> Like many companies, we use advertising services that try to tailor online ads to your interests based on information collected via cookies and similar technologies on our Marketing Pages.\nThis is called interest-based advertising.\nYou can get more information and opt-out of the use of cookies on our Marketing Pages by clicking the Do Not Sell My Personal Information link in the footer of this webpage.\nYou will need to set your preferences from each device and each web browser from which you wish to opt-out.\nThis feature uses a cookie to remember your preference, so if you clear all cookies from your browser, you will need to re-set your settings.\nFor more information regarding cookies or similar technologies, please review our Cookie Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our Referral Program</strong>\n</p>\n<p> You can use our referral program to tell others about Zoom in certain jurisdictions (where permitted under applicable law).\nWhen you do, you will be asked to provide that person\u2019s name and email so that we can contact them.\nWe rely on you to make sure the person you are referring to us has agreed to be contacted by us.\nWe will send a one-time email inviting them to visit a Marketing Page.\nUnless that person says they want to hear more, we will only use their name and email address to send this one-time email and to maintain an activity log of our referral program where permitted by law.\n</p> How We Share Personal Data <p> We only share personal data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Zoom when one of the following circumstances applies: </p> With Consent <p> We may share personal data with companies, organizations, individuals outside of Zoom and others when we have consent from an individual (as applicable).\n</p> With Zoom Partners <p> If Zoom received your personal data from a third-party partner and you become a Customer, Zoom may disclose select personal data to that partner or their designee for the purpose of the partnership agreement.\nfor example, to reward a referral partner from a co-sponsored event.\nZoom\u2019s partners have contractually agreed to comply with appropriate privacy and security obligations.\n</p> For corporate transactions <p> We may share personal data with actual or prospective acquirers, their representatives and other relevant participants in, or during negotiations of, any sale, merger, acquisition, restructuring, or change in control involving all or a portion of Zoom\u2019s business or assets, including in connection with bankruptcy or similar proceedings.\n</p> For business purposes <p> We provide personal data to vendors and services providers to help us provide the Services and for Zoom\u2019s business purposes.\nExamples include public cloud storage vendors, carriers, payment processor, and service provider for managing customer support tickets.\nZoom contractually prohibits such vendors from using the personal data for any reason other than to provide the contracted-for services and Zoom contractually requires its vendors to comply with all appropriate privacy and security requirements.\n</p> For legal reasons <p> We share personal data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Zoom if we believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li> meet any applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies.\n</li>\n<li> enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.\n</li>\n<li> detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.\n</li>\n<li> protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Zoom, our users or the public as required or permitted by law, including to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>For more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our Guidelines for Government Requests.\n</p> Data Subject Privacy Rights and Choices Right to Correct or Update Your Information <p> If you would like to correct or update information that you have provided to us, please logon to www.zoom.us and update your profile.\n</p> Marketing Communications <p> You may receive marketing email communications from us where permissible.\nIf you would like to stop receiving these communications, you can update your preferences by using the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link found in those emails.\n</p> European Privacy Rights <p> If you reside in the European Economic Area, you may have the right to exercise certain privacy rights available to you under applicable laws.\nWe will process your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.\nWe may need to retain certain information for record-keeping purposes or to complete transactions that you began prior to requesting any deletion.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Right not to provide consent or to withdraw consent.\n</strong>We may seek to rely on your consent in order to process certain personal data.\nWhere we do so, you have the right not to provide your consent or to withdraw your consent at any time.\nThis does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right of access and/or portability.\n</strong>You may have the right to access the personal data that we hold about you and, in some limited circumstances, have that data provided to you so that you can provide or \u201cport\u201d that data to another provider.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right of erasure.\n</strong>In certain circumstances, you may have the right to the erasure of personal data that we hold about you (for example if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected).\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to object to processing.\n</strong>You may have the right to request that Zoom stop processing your personal data and/or to stop sending you marketing communications.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to rectification.\n</strong>You may have the right to require us to correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal information.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to restrict processing.\n</strong>You may have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal data in certain circumstances (for example, where you believe that the personal data we hold about you is not accurate or lawfully held).\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to lodge a complaint to your local Data Protection Authority.\n</strong>If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal data.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> How to Exercise Your Rights <p> To exercise any of the rights above, email us at privacy@zoom.us.\nYou may also submit a request to the following address: </p>\n<p>Zoom Video Communications, Inc.</p>\n<p>Attention: Data Privacy Officer</p>\n<p>55 Almaden Blvd, Suite 600</p>\n<p>San Jose, CA 95113</p>\n<p> Please identify yourself and specify your request.\nIf you have a password protected Zoom account, we will use your account information to verify your identity.\nIf not, we will ask you to provide additional verification information.\nWhat we request will depend on the nature of your request, how sensitive the information is, and how harmful unauthorized disclosure or deletion would be.\n</p>\n<p> We use commercially reasonable efforts to delete your personal data as required but retain records necessary to comply with a governmental authority or applicable federal, state, or local law.\nWhere legally permitted, we may decline to process requests, including requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, or jeopardize the privacy of others.\n</p> International Transfers <p> Zoom operates globally, which means personal data may be stored and processed (for example stored in a data center) in any country where we or our service providers have facilities or hold events.\nBy using Zoom or providing personal data for any of the purposes stated above, you acknowledge that your personal data may be transferred to or stored in the United States or in other countries around the world.\nSuch countries may have data protection rules that are different and less protective than those of your country.\n</p>\n<p> If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), and your personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Process it in a territory which the European Commission has determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal information.\nor </li>\n<li> Implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, including transferring it in accordance with applicable transfer mechanism, including the European Commission's standard contractual clauses .\n</li>\n</ul> Retention <p> We will retain personal data for as long as required to do what we say we will in this Statement, unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law.\nThe criteria used to determine our retention periods include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide our services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our services).\n</li>\n<li> Whether we have a legal obligation to keep the data (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them).\nor </li>\n<li> Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Customers can delete their own accounts.</p> Security <p> Zoom is committed to protecting your personal data.\nWe use reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,

invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same economic effect of the original provision and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.4 General Provisions.</strong>&nbsp;This Agreement embodies the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties respecting the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes any and all prior understandings and agreements between the Parties respecting such subject matter, except that if You or Your company have executed a separate written agreement or you have signed an order form referencing a separate agreement governing your use of the Services, then such agreement shall control to the extent that any provision of this Agreement

Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Disputes</strong>.\nA dispute is any controversy between You and Zoom concerning the Services, any software related to the Services, the price of the Services, Your account, Zoom\u2019s advertising, marketing, or communications, Your purchase transaction or billing, or any term of this Agreement, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of Your or Zoom\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nAs part of the best efforts process to resolve disputes, and prior to initiating arbitration proceedings, each party agrees to provide notice of the dispute to the other party, including a description of the dispute, what efforts have been made to resolve it, and what the disputing party is requesting as resolution, to legal@zoom.us.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Small Claims Court Available</strong>.\nYou may initiate an action in your local Small Claims Court if You meets the court\u2019s requirements.\nHowever, if such a claim is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court, Zoom reserves the right to require arbitration.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedure</strong>.&nbsp;Disputes not resolved pursuant to Section A or B shall be resolved through arbitration.\nThe American Arbitration Association

limitations.\n(c) honor valid claims of privilege.\n(d) issue a written decision including the reasons for the award.\nThe arbitrator may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and costs (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees).\nAny arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction.&nbsp;<strong>Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim.\nhowever, a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity&nbsp;</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>.\nIf You are unable to afford the arbitration costs, Zoom will advance those costs to You, subject to the arbitrator\u2019s determination if costs should be reimbursed to Zoom if Zoom prevails.\nFor disputes involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Conflict with AAA Rules</strong>.\nThis Agreement governs if there is a conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Requirement to File Within One Year</strong>.\nNotwithstanding any other statute of limitations, a claim or dispute under this Agreement must be filed in Small Claims Court or noticed for arbitration within one year of when it could first be filed, or such claim will be permanently barred.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability</strong>.\nIf the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will be resolved in court, with the balance resolved through arbitration.\nIf any provision of this Exhibit A is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision will be severed.\nhowever, the remaining provisions shall still apply and shall be interpreted to as nearly as possible achieve the original intent of this Exhibit, inclusive of the severed provision.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol> \u00d7 About <ul>\n<li>Zoom Blog</li>\n<li>Customers</li>\n<li>Our
