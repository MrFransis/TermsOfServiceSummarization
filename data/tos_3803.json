transfer and securely store the unique vendor specific ID provided by the\nApple App Store or Android Play store when You install Wysa App on Your device.\nThis\nis done for the purpose of generating

terms, from Our storage systems.\nWithin 24 hours of\nstarting Your session, Our algorithms will process Your data, detect any personal\nidentifiers and irreversibly redact them.\nNone of Your conversation messages will be\nlost, and only the specific personal identifier will be irreversibly redacted in Our\nsystems.\nYou can view\nsuch\nobfuscation in the Journey tab within the Wysa
