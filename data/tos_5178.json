explains how Advangelists and its affiliates (collectively \u201cAdvangelists\u201d, \u201cwe\u201c, \u201cus\u201c, and \u201cours\u201c) use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our websites or websites of advertising partners (\u201cWebsite\u201c).&nbsp.\nIt explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>\n<b>What are cookies?</b>\n<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.\nCookies are widely used by publishers in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>\n<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Advangelists) are called \u201cfirst party cookies.\u201d&nbsp.\nCookies set by parties other than the website owner are called \u201cthird party cookies.\u201d Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Website (e.g.\nlike interactive content and analytics).\nThe parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the Website and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>\n<b>What cookies do we use?</b>\n<p>We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons.\nSome cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate.\nOther cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites.\nWe may also use cookies for analytics or other purposes.</p>\n<p>The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described in the table below:</p>\n<b>Types of third party cookies</b>\n<p>Essential website cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.</p>\n<p>Who serves these cookies: Advangelists</p>\n<p>How to refuse: because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Websites to you, you cannot refuse them.\nYou can block or delete them by changing your browser settings however, as described below under the heading \u201cHow can I control my cookies?\u201d</p>\n<p>Performance and functionality cookies: These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites but are non-essential to their use.&nbsp.\nHowever, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</p>\n<p>Analytics and customisation cookies: These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Websites are being used or how effective are marketing campaigns are, or to help us customise our Websites for you.</p>\n<p>Who serves these cookies: Google Analytics</p>\n<p>To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading \u201cHow can I control My cookies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<b>Web beacons and other technologies</b>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.&nbsp.\nWe may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called \u201ctracking pixels\u201d or \u201cclear gifs\u201d).&nbsp.\nThese are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail that we have sent them.&nbsp.\nThis allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.&nbsp.\nIn many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How can I control my cookies?</b>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.&nbsp.\nYou can exercise your cookie preferences by following the opt-out instructions below.</p>\n<p>Your Opt-Out Choices</p>\n<p>Because the effect of \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals remains unclear, and there continues to be no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to such a signal, we do not alter our privacy practices when we detect a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal from your browser.\nNonetheless, there are many ways to opt-out of the use of Advangelists technology for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements.\nPlease see our advertising technology privacy policy should you wish to do so.</p>\n<p>You can also refuse or accept cookies from the Website at any time by activating settings on your browser.&nbsp.\nInformation about the procedure to follow in order to enable or disable cookies can be found on your Internet browser provider\u2019s website via your help screen.&nbsp.\nYou may wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html for information on commonly used browsers.\nPlease be aware that if cookies are disabled, some website features may not operate as intended.</p>\n<p>Please note that opt-outs operate by placing a cookie on your device that is unique to the browser and device you use to opt-out.\nThey may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.\nIf you change browsers or computers, or delete the cookies on your computer, you will need to opt-out again.\nYou also can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set and to block most cookies, including ours.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How often will you update this Cookie Statement?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may update this Cookie Statement from

stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>\n<p>The date at the top of this Cookie Statement indicates when it was last updated.</p>\n<b>Where can I get further information?</b>\n<p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at privacy@advangelists.com.</p> Data Opt Out Policy\n<p>Advangelists respects the data protection and privacy rights you may have under applicable privacy laws (often referred to as \u201cdata subject rights\u201c or \u201cconsumer privacy rights\u201d).</p>\n<p>As explained in our privacy policy, our advertising technology does not collect information that directly identifies you as an individual (such as your name or email address).\nInstead, it only collects certain digital identifiers that enable us to recognize your device or your Internet browser (each, a \u201cDigital Identifier\u201d).</p>\n<p>For that reason, in order for us to honor any data protection and privacy requests you submit, we need you to provide us with your Digital Identifiers and certain other information.&nbsp.\nThis is necessary to locate any records we hold about your device or browser.\nWe explain below how to do this, and use this additional information only for the purpose of processing your data protection and privacy requests.</p>\nYOUR RIGHTS EXPLAINED\n<p>Residents of some jurisdictions , including California, have certain rights available to them under the laws of those jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>These rights may include the right to request access to, rectify, or request erasure/deletion or portability of, personal information.\nResidents of these jurisdictions may also have a right to object to, or request that we restrict, processing of their personal information.\nWhere such rights apply, we will comply with requests to exercise these rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.\nWe will also make efforts to honor such requests even in jurisdictions that do not provide for these rights</p>\n<p>If you make a request to access the specific pieces of personal information we hold about you in accordance with applicable law (also known as an \u201caccess request\u201c), we will provide the Digital Identifiers of your browser(s) and/or device(s) that Advangelists may store.\nAdditionally, we may also provide you with certain other information that we may have stored and associated with your Digital Identifiers.</p>\n<p>Please note, however, that we have a very short retention period for the data we associate with Digital Identifiers.\nAs a result, we may not be able to provide you any records in response to an access request.\nIn such cases, however, we will inform you that we have not been able to locate any records associated with your Digital Identifiers.</p>\n<p>Important Note: We have a responsibility to verify your identity before we respond to an access request.\nThis is to make sure that we provide a copy of your personal information only to the person who is entitled to it \u2013 you.\nIf you wish to make an access request, we kindly ask that you contact us directly, with sufficient details for us to verify your identity (as explained below).</p>\n<b>HOW TO MAKE A DATA RIGHTS REQUEST</b>\n<p>If you wish to exercise a data subject rights request, please follow the steps described below:</p>\nStep 1: Locate Your Digital Identifiers\n<p>In order for us to locate relevant records, we will need you to provide us with your Digital Identifiers.\nYou can find your Digital Identifiers as follows:</p>\n<i>Web Browsing</i>\n<p>As described in our privacy policy, our advertising technology operates by using text files called \u201ccookies\u201d that are placed on your device.\nSome of these cookies include a Digital Identifier.\nTo locate these Digital Identifiers, you can search through your cookies for the cookies named \u201ckhaos\u201d and \u201cruid\u201d (which are set from the advangelists.com domain).\nThe text in each of these cookies is a separate Digital Identifier.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that different cookies are placed on each browser that you use to access the Internet.\nAs a result, if you use multiple browsers (for example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox), you will need to locate the \u201ckhaos\u201d and \u201cruid\u201d cookies for each browser.</p>\n<i>Mobile Devices and other Internet Connected Devices</i>\n<p>Additionally, certain mobile devices (for example, mobile phones or tablets using the iOS or Android operating systems) generate a persistent \u201cAdvertising Identifier\u201d per device, which, among other things, can be used by third parties, like Advangelists, for purposes of providing you with targeted advertising.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On iOS devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an \u201cIDFA,\u201d \u201cIFA,\u201d or an \u201cID for Advertising.\u201d On Android devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an \u201cAdvertising ID.\u201d Please follow instructions from your mobile device manufacturer on how to locate your specific Advertising Identifier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nStep 2: Verify Your Digital Identifiers\n<p>In order to make sure that we are responding to the correct person, we also will need some supporting proof to demonstrate that the devices that have the Digital Identifiers you located in Step 1 are yours and that the information you are requesting relates to you.&nbsp.\nFor Digital Identifiers stored in cookies, please take a screenshot of each cookie, taking care to make sure that the screenshot shows both the name of the cookie and the full Digital Identifier.\nFor Digital Identifiers located on a mobile device, please take a screenshot of a screen that displays the Digital Identifier.</p>\n<p>We may also request that you respond to a few questions, so that we can appropriately verify your identity.\nDoing this helps us to validate that you have access to the device on which the Digital Identifiers have been placed (and that you are not an unauthorized third party attempting to \u201cguess\u201d Digital Identifiers).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nStep 3: Submit to Advangelists\n<p>Once you have located your Digital Identifiers and can provide us with verification of those Digital Identifiers, please email privacy@advangelists.com with details of the rights you wish to exercise..\nWe will request the following information:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your full name</li>\n<li>The region in which you are located at the time you are making your request</li>\n<li>The data subject rights you wish to exercise</li>\n<li>A full list of your Digital Identifiers</li>\n<li>Device validation information, as set forth in Step 2</li>\n<li>Identity certification</li>\n</ul> Technology Privacy Policy\n<p>This policy applies to the information Advangelists (\u201cAdvangelists,\u201d

with you or your household, including web browsers, mobile apps, and televisions.\nOur clients may use this third-party data in combination with the User Information we collect to deliver you targeted ads across multiple devices.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How We Use User Information</b>\n</p>\n<p>Our clients use User Information in order to buy and sell advertising space on Digital Media Properties.\nIn
