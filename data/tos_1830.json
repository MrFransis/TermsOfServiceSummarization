Arbitration\n<p>The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.\nExcept for disputes relating to the Strava\u2019s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents) or if you opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement and your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with its provisions and procedures for consumer-related disputes, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.\nThe arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court.\nprovided, however, that the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies, or awards that conflict with this Agreement.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nTo the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Strava will pay the additional cost.\nYou and Strava hereby expressly waive trial by jury.\nYou also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person\u2019s account, if Strava is a party to the proceeding.\nThis dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\nThis provision does not apply to users who live in the European Union.</p>\n<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nThey further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p> Class-Action Waiver\n<p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only, and not as a class action or other representative action.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason, or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p> Exception\u2014Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims\n<p>Notwithstanding the parties\u2019 decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p> Thirty-Day Right to Opt Out\n<p>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration- and class-action-waiver provisions set forth in this section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Strava, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 208 Utah

with governing law for EU users mentioned below.</p> Choice of Law and Forum\n<p>Any action related to the Terms, Content, the Services, and your relationship with the Strava shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles AND WILL SPECIFICALLY NOT BE GOVERNED BY THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTIONS ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, IF OTHERWISE APPLICABLE.\nSubject to the Section entitled \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d, the parties irrevocably consent to bring any action to enforce this Agreement in the federal or state courts embracing San Francisco, California and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts embracing San Francisco, California.\nIf any party hereto brings any suit or action against another for relief, declaratory or otherwise, arising out of these Terms, the prevailing party will have and recover against the other party, in addition to all court costs and disbursements, such sum as the court may adjudge to be reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\nExcept to the extent prohibited by applicable law, the parties agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.\nThis paragraph does not apply to users who reside in the European Union.</p>\n<p>If you are a user based in the European Union, then Irish law shall apply to these Terms and the Irish

numbers.\nStrava engages providers that are industry leaders in online security, including Services verification, to strengthen the security of our Services.\nThe Services are registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can confirm Strava\u2019s identity before any personal information is sent.\nIn addition, Strava\u2019s secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall technology.</p> Managing Your Settings Privacy Controls\n<p>Strava offers several features and settings to help you manage your privacy and share your activities.\nMost privacy controls are located in your privacy controls page, but some are specific to individual activities, athletes, or routes.\nStrava provides you the option to make your activities private.\nClick here to manage your privacy controls.</p> Adjust Notification and Email Preferences\n<p>Strava offers various ways to manage the notifications you receive.\nYou can choose to stop receiving certain emails and notifications by indicating your preference here.\nYou may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained at the bottom of marketing or promotional emails.\nAny administrative or service-related emails (to confirm a purchase, or an update to this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service, etc.) generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the Services you requested.</p> Updating Account Information\n<p>You may correct, amend or update profile or account information at any time by adjusting that information in your account settings.\nIf you need further assistance correcting inaccurate information, please contact Strava at https://support.strava.com.</p> Deleting Information and Accounts and Downloading Your Data\n<p>You can delete your account or download your data using our self-service tools.\nClick here to download your data, including your activity files.\nTo request that your account is deleted, click here.</p>\n<p>After you make a deletion request, we permanently and irreversibly delete your personal data from our systems, including backups.\nOnce deleted, your data, including your account, activities and place on leaderboards cannot be reinstated.\nFollowing your deletion of your account, it may take up to 90 days to delete your personal information and system logs from our systems.\nAdditionally, we may retain information where deletion requests are made to comply with the law and take other actions permitted by law.</p>\n<p>Note that content you have shared with others, such as photos, or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have deleted your account or deleted specific information from your own profile.\nYour public profile may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache.</p>\n<p>Strava also provides you the option to remove individual activities you have posted without deleting your account.\nOnce removed,the activities may remain on Strava\u2019s systems until you delete your account.</p> Your Rights and Our Legal Bases\n<p>We provide the same suite of privacy tools and controls to all of our members worldwide.\nParticular rights may be available to you if you reside in certain locations, such as the EEA, Brazil or California.\nLearn more about your rights and how to exercise them.</p> Your Legal Rights in the EEA\n<p>If you are habitually located in the EEA, you have the right to access, rectify, download or erase your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information.\nLearn more.</p> Our Legal Bases\n<p>Strava relies on a number of legal bases to collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill our obligations pursuant to the Terms of Service.\nFor example, we cannot provide the Services unless we collect and use your location information;</li>\n<li>where you have consented to the processing;</li>\n<li>where necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims;</li>\n<li>to protect your vital interests, or those of others, such as in the case of emergencies.\nand</li>\n<li>where necessary for the purposes of Strava\u2019s or a third party\u2019s legitimate interests, such as our interests in protecting our members, our partners\u2019 interests in collaborating with our members, and our commercial interests in ensuring the sustainability of the Services.</li>\n</ul> Transfers\n<p>The Services are operated from the United States.\nIf you are located outside of the United States and choose to use the Services or provide information to us, you acknowledge and understand that your information will be transferred, processed and stored in the United States, as it is necessary to provide the Services and perform the Terms of Service.\nUnited States privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.</p> Retention of Information\n<p>We retain information as long as it is necessary to provide the Services to you and others, subject to any legal obligations to further retain such information.\nInformation associated with your account will generally be kept until it is no longer necessary to provide the Services or until your account is deleted.\nIn addition, you can delete some items of information (e.g., profile information) and you can remove individual activities from view on the Services without deleting your account.\nFor example, after you withdraw your consent to Strava processing your health-related information, Strava will delete all health-related information you upload.\nFollowing your deletion of your account, it may take up to 90 days to fully delete your personal information and system logs from our systems.\nAdditionally, we may retain information to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce the Terms of Service and take other actions permitted by law.\nThe information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Information connected to you that is no longer necessary and relevant to provide our Services may be de-identified or aggregated with other non-personal data to provide insights which are commercially valuable to Strava, such as statistics of the use of the Services.\nFor example, we may retain publicly available segments or routes and other depersonalized geolocation information to continue to improve the Services and we use aggregated information in Strava Metro and our Global Heatmap.\nThis information will be de-associated with your name and other identifiers.</p> Other Strava Sites\n<p>Strava maintains certain websites that can be accessed outside of https://strava.com, such as https://blog.strava.com (the \u201cOther Sites\u201d).\nThe Other Sites maintain the look and feel of the Services, but are hosted by outside service providers with their own terms and privacy policies.\nIf you interact with the Other Sites, your information may be stored, processed, or shared outside of the Services.\nIf you interact with the Other Sites, you acknowledge that you may be subject to the terms and conditions and policies applicable to such Other Site.\nPlease be aware that any personal information you submit to the Other Sites may be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums indefinitely, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.\nStrava is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit via the Other Sites.</p> Privacy Policy Information\n<p>Strava reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.\nPlease review it occasionally.\nIf Strava makes changes to this Privacy Policy, the updated Privacy Policy will be posted on the Services in a timely manner and, if we make material changes, we will provide a prominent notice.\nIf you object to any of the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should stop using the Services and delete your account.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n\u00a9&nbsp;2020 Strava\n", "created_at": "2019-09-08 23:24:23.17573", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 21:28:52.284636"}, {"id": 1879, "name": "Cookie
