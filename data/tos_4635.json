discloses information collected from its customers and users of its website.\nThis website is not directed at children under 13 years of age.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Information We Collect <p>IONOS may request or collect personal information from online users in a variety of ways, including through online forms for requesting information or ordering products and services, and other instances where users are invited to volunteer such information.\nSome of the data we collect is information that identifies you personally, and may include your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone and telefax numbers, payment account information, and other information necessary to provide the services requested.\nIONOS also maintains a record of contacts for customer or technical support.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IONOS may also collect information about how users access the website through log files and the use of cookies, and through third party services such as Mouseflow and Google Analytics.\nSuch information may include standard information from your web browser (such as browser type and language), your Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address, and the actions you take on IONOS's Web sites (such as the web pages viewed and the links clicked).\nTo opt out of Mouseflow please visit www.mouseflow.com/opt-out/.</p> What are Cookies? <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.\nWe may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.\nFor session ID cookies, once you close your browser or log out, the cookie terminates and is erased.\nA persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your computer's hard drive for an extended period of time.\nYour browser's help file contains information and instructions for removing persistent cookies.\nSession ID cookies may be used by IONOS to track user preferences while the user is visiting the website.\nThey also help to minimize load times and save on server processing.\nPersistent cookies may be used by IONOS to store whether, for example, you want your password remembered or not, and other information.\nCookies used on the IONOS website do not contain personally identifiable information.</p> Log Files <p>Like most standard websites, we use log files.\nThis information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.\nHowever, none of the information stored in our log files, including but not limited to IP addresses, is linked to personally identifiable information.</p> How we Use and Share this information <p>IONOS may use and share your personal information in order to provide the services requested.\nFor example, your information may be provided to the domain

to comply with ICANN's rules, regulations, and policies, and if your domains are not set to private registration, the publicly available WHOIS registry will contain personal information, including but

information to the certificate authority in order to fulfill the request and you acknowledge and understand that IONOS acts only as an intermediary between the customer and the certificate authority, in order to facilitate the order or renewal of the certificate.\nIONOS has no influence on the outcome of an SSL certificate request and cannot guarantee that any request for an SSL certificate order or renewal will be granted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IONOS may also use the personally identifiable information collected by IONOS to contact customers regarding products and services offered by IONOS

research purposes regarding the effectiveness of our website services, marketing, advertising and sales efforts, including, without limitation, for purposes of customer reviews (such as for the utilization of programs like Google Seller Ratings).\nIONOS will not sell or otherwise share this information with a third party for a third party\\x92s marketing purposes, unless you specifically authorize such information sharing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IONOS may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from users to investors and potential partners.\nIn such

transferred to the new owners.</p>\n<p>IONOS may from time to time engage third parties, including its own subsidiaries and affiliated companies, to preserve, analyze or otherwise store or manipulate
