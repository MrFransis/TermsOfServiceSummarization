participants who do the same.\nAlthough the opportunity is based on a simple affiliate business model, individual results will vary depending on commitment levels and sales skills of each participant.\nSince Traffic Authority has recently launched, it lacks enough statistical data to prepare reliable income disclosures.\nThe numbers below reflect estimates prepared by the company pending a more detailed survey to be conducted after its first year.\nBased on industry standards and company projections, the average annual gross income for Affiliates is projected to be anywhere between $500 and $2,000.\nThere will certainly be participants who will earn less while others will earn much more.\nWe\u2019re excited about the Traffic Authority Compensation Plan and we\u2019re confident it will provide you a solid foundation to help you achieve your financial goals.</p>\n<p>If income projections were presented to you prior to your enrollment, such projections are not necessarily representative of the income, if any, that you can or will earn through your participation in the Compensation Plan.\nThese income projections should not be considered as guarantees or projections of your actual earnings or profits.\nSuccess with Traffic Authority results only from hard work, dedication, and leadership.</p>\n<p>This illustration is only for educational purposes and is not intended to serve as a guarantee of income.\nSuccess in this business requires hard work, dedication and good sales skills.\nThe average participant in this business earns between $500 and
