Act (CCPA):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identifiers, such as name and location;</li>\n<li>Personal information, as defined in the California customer records law, such as contact (including email and telephone number) and financial information;</li>\n<li>Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (if you choose to provide them), such as age, gender identity, marital status, sexual orientation, race, ancestry, national origin, religion, and medical conditions;</li>\n<li>Commercial information, such as transaction information and purchase history;</li>\n<li>Biometric information (not relevant here);</li>\n<li>Internet or network activity information, such as browsing history and interactions with our websites and apps;</li>\n<li>Geolocation data, such as mobile device location;</li>\n<li>Audio, electronic, visual and similar information, such as photos and videos;</li>\n<li>Professional or employment-related information, such as work history and prior employer;</li>\n<li>Non-public education information.\nand</li>\n<li>Inferences drawn from any of the personal information listed above to create a profile or summary about, for example, an individual\u2019s preferences and characteristics.</li>\n</ol>Data Storage\n<p>By using the App, you acknowledge that Bumble is a global app operating through servers located in a number of countries around the world, including the United States.\nIf you live in a country with data protection laws, the storage of your personal data may not provide you with the same protections as you enjoy in your country of residence.</p>Geolocation Information\n<p>If you turn these features on, when you use your mobile, we will collect information about WiFi access points as well as other location information about your longitude and latitude and may save your device's coordinates to offer certain features to you.\nThis information helps us identify your physical location and we may use it to personalise the App and make it easier for you to interact with other Users, by enabling the information to be displayed and shared with other members choosing to view \u201cnearby\u201d posts.</p>\n<p>If you have enabled location services, but wish to turn them off, you can do so by the following methods:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>iPhone app \u2014 settings, privacy, location services, Bumble</li>\n<li>Android \u2014 settings, location, Bumble, permissions, location</li>\n</ol>Log and Usage Data\n<p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as set out in Section 11 below) and as permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>In practice, we delete or anonymise your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window), unless:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some \u201ctraffic data\u201d is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations);</li>\n<li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);</li>\n<li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved.\nor</li>\n<li>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security.\nFor example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Where Bumble uses machine learning, for example, to help us detect and prevent fraudulent card transactions, and to detect and prevent spam communications on the App (as explained above), we may need to keep personal information for a longer period than the retention periods explained above, to enable the machine learning to work properly.\nWhere this is the case, we always seek to minimise the amount of personal information that is used and we ensure that it is ring-fenced and kept securely from other user personal information.\nWe regularly review the period for which personal information is required for machine learning purposes and delete any identifiable information when it is no longer required.</p>Device Information\n<p>We may collect information about your device when you use the App including the unique device identifier, device model, operating system, and MAC address.\nIn addition, if you permit us to do so, the App may access your device's address book solely in order to add someone to your contacts.</p>Links\n<p>We may keep track of how you interact with links available on Bumble including third party services and clients by redirecting clicks or through other means.\nWe may share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.\n</p>Cookies\n<p>Unlike the chocolate chip kind, these cookies have no calories!

enforce their intellectual property or other rights.\nWe will also cooperate with law enforcement enquiries from within or outside your country of residence where we are required to by law, where there is an investigation into alleged criminal behaviour or to protect the vital interests of a person.\nThis may include preserving or disclosing any of your information, including your Registration Information, if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with a law or regulation, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal request.\nto protect the safety of any person.\nto address fraud, security or technical issues e.g.\nthrough anti-spam providers to protect the service from criminal activity or to protect our

does not sell your data and has not sold your personal data in the previous 12 months.</p>4.\nWHAT OTHERS MAY SEE ABOUT YOU.\n<p>We think our Bumblers are awesome, and we want you to share how awesome you are with the world, so we have built certain features to enable this.\nOur App is designed to make it easier for you to connect with other Users and to interact with them.\nIf you register or log in to the App using your Facebook account, you are authorising us to access certain Facebook account information, including information you make available via Facebook, your friends list, current location and those friends you have in common with other Bumblers.\nYou also understand that your Bumble profile and other information you make available via the App, including information you provide directly or indirectly through Facebook (i.e., your Facebook photos, your name, age, approximate location, friends you have in common with other Bumblers and other profile information), may be viewed and shared by Bumblers with individuals who may or may not be Users or via third party applications in such Bumblers\u2019 discretion.\nFor example, a User may recommend you as a match to his or her Facebook friends by sharing your picture, regardless of whether such friend(s) is also a User of the App.\nYou might share information like the photos and messages you send or upload and any metadata provided with those messages, along with any comments or information you provide in connection with your photos.</p>\n<p>When using Bumble, you should assume that <b>anything</b> you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users of the App and non-Users of the App.\nWe want our Bumblers to be careful about posting information that will eventually be made public.</p>\n<p>If you log in to or access Bumble through your Facebook profile, remember to log off Facebook when you leave a device in order to prevent other users from accessing your account.</p>5.\nMODIFYING YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION.\n<p>You may access or modify the Registration Information you provided at any time or permanently delete your Account (although we really hope you don't!) </p>\n<p>When your Account is deactivated, we take reasonable efforts to make sure it is no longer viewable on the App.\nFor up to 30 days it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.\nAfter 30 days, we begin the process of deleting your Account from our systems.\nWe are not responsible for any information, pictures, comments, or other content that is deleted from our systems resulting from the deactivation of your Account.</p>\n<p>To prevent abuse and/or misuse of Bumble by a User following termination or deletion of a profile/Account we shall retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that User does not open a new Account and profile in breach of our Terms and Conditions of Use and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Warning</b>: Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your Account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other Users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines.\nWe cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this.\nIf you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.</p>\n<p>Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 30 days to enable restoration, but will not be available to others in the meantime.</p>6.\nOUR POLICY TOWARDS AGE.\n<p>Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you have to be at least 18 years old to use the App - sorry kids, we know Bumble is cool, but you'll have to come back when you're old enough! </p>\n<p>Bumble does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors or anyone under the age of 18.\nIf you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to us.\nIf we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person's registration and delete their Registration Information from Bumble.\nIf we do delete a profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new profile.</p>7.\nCHANGES TO THIS POLICY.\n<p>As Bumble evolves, we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nThe most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at bumble.com/privacy/.\nIf we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you, for example, via an email to the email associated with your Account or by posting a notice within Bumble.\nBy continuing to access or use the App after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>8.\nSECURITY.\n<p>Here at Bumble we pride ourselves on taking commercially reasonable security measures to help protect your information against loss, misuse and unauthorised access, or disclosure.\nWe use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information such as secured servers using firewalls.\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately no website or Internet transmission is ever completely 100% secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur, but here are some handy tips to help keep your data secure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never know who may stumble onto your Account!</li>\n<li>Please don't share your social media password with anyone else! </li>\n<li>Change your social media password periodically.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you ever think someone has had access to your social media password, please report it to the relevant social media platform and change your password immediately.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is being transmitted to our site and any transmission is at your own risk.</p>\n<p>\n<b>WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACHES OF SECURITY, DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICE, OR ANY LOSS OR UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION OR OTHER DATA.</b>\n</p>9.\nTHIRD PARTY ACCOUNTS.\n<p>If you have registered with Bumble using a third party social media platform, such as Facebook, your Bumble profile will be available to all Users of Bumble whether via our App or our partners' websites.</p>\n<p>Remember that when you register with a third party, you are also giving them personal information, so we recommend that you read their privacy policies as Bumble does not control how they use their information.</p>\n<p>If you have registered on one of these third party websites, such as Facebook, or you have verified your Account via a third party website, we may connect your Bumble profile with your profile on such website.\nWe may do this by way of new products and applications which we introduce from time to time, including new products powered by our group companies.</p>\n<p>If you have created a Bumble profile through a third party website and you do not want to link your Bumble profile to your profile on the third party website, Bumble cannot amend these settings.\nPlease visit the application settings on your third party website profile and follow the instructions to remove the Bumble access permissions.</p>\n<p>We only use the APIs, OAuth Tokens, Widgets, or other means provided by the applicable Social Media Account to integrate your Social Media Account with our App.\nAs such, we only receive the limited information that each Social Media Account permits to be transferred.</p>10.\nYOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.<p>For users who are California residents, you have the following rights (in addition to those listed at section 11 below) under the California Consumer Privacy Act, and you have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the Act:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you and explain how we have collected, used and shared your personal information over the past 12 months.</li>\n<li>You have the right to request that we delete your personal information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>California's \"Shine the Light\" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.\nIf you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you can write to us at feedback@team.bumble.com.</p>\n<p>From time to time we may disclose your contact information to third parties to allow them to market their products or services to you or for other marketing purposes.\nThis may be information we received from you offline and online.\nIf you want us to stop further sharing your email contact information with third parties (if we have your email contact information), you may notify us at feedback@team.bumble.com.\nPlease follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.\nIf you have opted-out as described above, and thereafter you choose to use a service or promotion that requires us to contact you or share your information with a third party, then your previous opt-out preferences will not apply to such service.\n</p>\n<p>In addition, under California law, operators of online services are required to disclose how they respond to \"do not track\" signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party online services, to the extent the operator engages in that collection.\nAt this time, we do not track our Users' personal information over time and across third-party online services.\nThis law also requires operators of online services to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users' online activities over time and across different online services when the users use the operator's service.\nWe do not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal information about an individual User's online activities over time and across different online services when using the App.</p>11.\nYOUR UK AND EU RIGHTS.<p>Under UK and EU law, you have the right to lodge a complaint with data protection regulators, and the
