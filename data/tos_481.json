\u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) collects and uses personally-identifiable data and, for California residents, to inform them of the categories of personal information we collect and the purposes for which the categories of personal information will be used, as required under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d).</p>\n<p>For a detailed description about what data we gather and how we use it, please review our&nbsp;Privacy Policy, our&nbsp;Zenfolio Terms of Service&nbsp;for our online services for photographers, and our&nbsp;Photobooker Terms of Service&nbsp;for our online photographer booking service.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What does Zenfolio do?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Zenfolio offers two&nbsp;online platforms, one at www.zenfolio.com that allows photographers to exhibit, organize, print, sell, exchange, and share digital images, videos and related products, and the other at www.photobooker.com that allows photographers and their prospective customers to arrange photoshoots (such websites referred to collectively as the \u201cSite\u201d and the Site, together with the corresponding services, referred to as the \u201cServices\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Why does Zenfolio need personal information?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Operation of our Services necessarily requires in the collection of \u201cpersonal information,\u201d which is defined in the CCPA broadly to include data that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household or device.&nbsp;&nbsp;The categories of personal information that we collect are listed below, but here are a few examples of why we need to collect personal information:</p>\n<p>For example, in order to establish accounts for photographers at www.zenfolio.com, we need basic information about them, such as their names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment information and payout information.\nAnd in order to process orders, we collect similar information from the photographers\u2019 customers, such as, such as name, shipping address, email address, phone number and payment information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As another example, when photographers and customers book photoshoots through photobooker.com, we collect their contact information, including names, email addresses, phone and numbers, in order to maintain the scheduling information for the photoshoot and to enable communications between the photographer and the customer.</p>\n<p>We only collect personal information from you when you use our Services or interact with our customer support personnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;We don\u2019t collect any personal information from any other source.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, we don\u2019t sell your personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;We use it only to enable the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that we cannot provide the Services if you don\u2019t allow us to use your personal information, so if you don\u2019t like that your personal information will be used for that purpose, we can\u2019t provide Services to you.\nBy user our Services, you are expressly consenting to our use of your personal information for that purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>What categories of personal information does Zenfolio collect?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Below is a summary of the categories of personal information we may have collected from consumers within the last twelve (12) months and the main purpose for its collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that not all of the information identified below is

information&nbsp;Information about images uploaded by photographers, which may include facial recognition data.&nbsp.\nPhotographers, not Zenfolio, control the use of facial recognition tools and the identification of facial recognition data to a name or identity of an individual.For sorting or organizing photographs in a gallery.<p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information from you or use it differently than as described unless we provide you with advance notice and obtain your consent.</p>\n<p>Please note that photographers may elect to make it easier for their customers to identify or sort photographs in their photo galleries by implementing facial recognition tools we make available through our services.&nbsp.\nWhile Zenfolio may host such facial recognition data to enable photographers to identify and organize their images, the photographers have control of identifying any facial recognition data to a name or identity and are solely responsible for doing so.&nbsp.\nZenfolio only uses that data as implemented by photographers, and does not sell that data or use it for any other purpose.&nbsp.\nFurther, Zenfolio does not have any independent method to be able to identify or verify any individual based on that facial recognition data.&nbsp.\nZenfolio considers such data as Processor Data as described in the Zenfolio Privacy Policy, and retains it so long as the photographer utilizes those features.&nbsp.\nAccordingly, requests pertaining to such data may have to be resolved by the applicable photographer.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What are other uses of personal information?</b>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the uses described above, we may use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more of the following business purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To fulfill or meet the reason for which the information is provided.\nFor example, if you contact our customer support, we may use your email address to communicate with you about your support issue.</li>\n<li>To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us.</li>\n<li>To provide you with alerts and other notices concerning our products or services.</li>\n<li>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights under the Zenfolio Terms of Service and/or Photobooker Terms of Service.</li>\n<li>For testing, research, analysis and product development to improve our Services.</li>\n<li>To protect the rights, property or safety of us, our subscribers or others and to respond to legal requests.</li>\n<li>As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the CCPA.</li>\n<li>For the other purposes set forth in our Privacy Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Is Zenfolio a \u201ccontroller\u201d or a \u201cprocessor\u201d?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Lots of companies are making distinctions about who is a \u201ccontroller,\u201d and who is \u201cprocessor,\u201d when it comes to using personal data.\nThat\u2019s because the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) effective May 25, 2018, distinguishes a \u201ccontroller,\u201d (the party primarily responsible for protecting \u201cpersonal data\u201d) from a \u201cprocessor\u201d (which is essentially a subcontractor that has secondary, but important responsibilities to protect \u201cpersonal data\u201d).\nAnd CCPA distinguishes between a business that collects personal information and its service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context of providing services to photographers, Zenfolio would be considered a \u201cprocessor\u201d under GDPR and a \u201cservice provider\u201d in its provision of Photographer Services, as described in the Zenfolio Terms of Use.\nWhere we mange accounts and fulfill transactions for you, we would be a \u201ccontroller\u201d under GDPR and a \u201cbusiness\u201d under CCPA.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How does Zenfolio work with third parties?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Zenfolio engages third parties to provide hosting, printing, transactional and other services.\nThose third parties, under contract with Zenfolio, provide (i) the backend, hosting, technology, and communications systems necessary for the Services to function (\u201cBack End Providers\u201d), (ii) print and order fulfillment providers that fulfill print orders for the Zenfolio Service and enable financial transactions (\u201cFulfillment Providers\u201d).\nand (iii) analytics services and customer support platforms (\u201cService Providers\u201d).\nWe have contractual agreements with those third parties that require them to adhere to applicable data privacy and confidentiality requirements, including GDPR-specific addendums where applicable.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Where is the data held?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Zenfolio utilizes data centers in the United States, where all of our necessary systems are located.\nSome of our support programs leverage affiliated companies in the European Union (EU) to provide customer support, and those European-based customer support teams may have remote access to account information, but they do not store that information.\nTransfers of personal data to and among our affiliates are subject to terms of intercompany agreements governing the transfer of data to the United States and protection of that data under applicable law.\nAlso, we require that you acknowledge and agree to allow us to transfer data to the United States, so if you\u2019re not willing to provide that consent, you shouldn\u2019t use our products and services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What safeguards does Zenfolio utilize to protect data?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures for our systems to comply with data privacy to ensure a level of data protection appropriate to the risk resulting from the processing of personal data, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the severity and likelihood of realization of risks for the rights and freedoms of folks who\u2019ve provided the data.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What are my rights as a California resident?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information, as described below</p>\n<p>\n<i>Opt Out of the Sale of Personal Information</i>\n</p>\n<p>The CCPA requires that we notify you of your right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we don\u2019t sell your personal information as contemplated under the CCPA, so there\u2019s no need for you to opt out of the sale of your personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</i>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.\nNote that under the CCPA you may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>\n<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>\n<li>If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose:<ul>\n<li>The categories of personal information that we\u2019ve sold about you and the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold.</li>\n<li>The categories of personal information that we disclosed for a business purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about the specific personal information we may have collected about you in the past 12 months, please send us an email request to do so at&nbsp;privacy@zenfolio.com&nbsp;or a written request at our office address set forth at the end of this notice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>Deletion Request Rights</i>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.</p>\n<p>As discussed above, we can\u2019t provide any Services to you without your personal information, so if you ask us to delete your personal information, we will have to terminate your accounts on our system and you will no longer be able to use the Services for their intended purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you still want us to delete your personal information, you have to send us a verifiable request for us to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;To send a deletion request to use, please send us an email request to do so at&nbsp;privacy@zenfolio.com&nbsp;or a written request at our office address set forth at the end of this notice.</p>\n<p>Please note that the CCPA includes a number of exceptions that allow us to retain your personal data despite your deletion request, so we may retain your personal data under those exceptions.</p>\n<p>\n<i>A note on verification</i>\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve sent us a request as noted above, we will need to verify who you are.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may be able to verify you via email or through your account with the Services if you\u2019re a subscriber.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if you\u2019re not a subscriber or a customer, or if we don\u2019t have sufficient data about you, we may not be able to verify who you are.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, where we act as a service provider to a photographer, we will pass on your verified request
