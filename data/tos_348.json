to the Services, and the Content is owned or controlled by Hulu and Hulu's content programmers.\nThe Services and the Content are also protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.\nThat said, Hulu is pleased to grant you a non-exclusive limited license to use the Services, including accessing and viewing the Content on a streaming-only basis through the Video Player, for personal, non-commercial purposes as set forth in these Terms.\nThe periods during which you can view each piece of Content will vary based on the rights availability of such Content and the terms of your subscription.\nThe Services may include different Content offerings, features, and usage rules, which will be explained to you during your sign-up or in other materials made available to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.3 Profiles.</strong> Hulu offers the option to personalize use of the Services through the creation of one or more profiles under one account.\nOnly the account holder, and those with permission from the account holder, may create a profile.\nThe account holder may access profile details and delete or otherwise modify profiles associated with the account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.4 The Content.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>a.\nUsage Rules and Limitations.</strong> You may not either directly or through the use of any device, software, internet site, web-based service, or other means remove, alter, bypass, avoid, interfere with, or circumvent any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices marked on the Content or any digital rights management mechanism, device, or other content protection or access control measure associated with the Content including geo-filtering mechanisms.\nFor clarity, you may not use any technology or technique that obscures or disguises your location when you are accessing the Services.\nYou may not either directly or through the use of any device, software, internet site, web-based service, or other means copy, record, download, stream capture, reproduce, duplicate, archive, distribute, upload, publish, modify, translate, broadcast, perform, display, sell, or transmit or retransmit the Content unless expressly permitted by the terms of your subscription or otherwise by Hulu in writing.\nYou may not incorporate the Content into, or stream or retransmit the Content via, any hardware or software application or make it available via frames or in-line links unless expressly permitted by Hulu in writing.\nFurthermore, you may not create, recreate, distribute or advertise an index of any significant portion of the Content unless authorized by Hulu.\nYou may not build a business utilizing the Content, whether or not for profit.\nThe Content covered by these restrictions includes without limitation any text, graphics, layout, interface, logos, photographs, audio and video materials, and stills.\nIn addition, you are strictly prohibited from creating derivative works or materials that otherwise are derived from or based on in any way the Content, including montages, mash-ups and similar videos, wallpaper, desktop themes, greeting cards, and merchandise, unless expressly permitted by Hulu in writing.\nThis prohibition applies even if you intend to give away the derivative materials free of charge.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b.\nContent Subjectivity.</strong> Content tends to elicit varying reactions among different people.\nYou may come across Content that you find offensive, indecent, explicit or objectionable.\nAlso, Content types, genres, categories, and descriptions are provided as suggestions to help with navigation, and Hulu does not guarantee that you will agree with them.\nYou acknowledge these risks.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c.\nContent Quality.</strong> Hulu uses various technologies to provide you with an optimal viewing experience.\nThat said, quality of Content, including resolution, may be affected by the format of the Content, your location, the speed and bandwidth of your internet service, and the devices used, among other factors.\nHD and 4K Ultra HD availability for certain Content depends on your internet service and device capabilities.\nThe time it takes you to begin playing Content will vary based on a number of factors, including your location, internet bandwidth, the number of devices simultaneously connecting to the same network, the Content you have selected, and the configuration of the device you are using.\nAs a result, Hulu is unable to make any warranties about the Content in these respects.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>d.\nContent Presentation.</strong> We want you to have the best experience with our Services, including the ability to easily discover and enjoy new Content.\nTo help do that, Content you view across all Services may include promotional videos (e.g., previews or trailers) before and after that Content.\nPlease note that Content you view (e.g., legal and medical shows) should not be relied upon for advice.\nFor those who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitivities, it\u2019s also important to remember that some Content may contain flashing lights sequences or patterns.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>e.\nTemporary Downloads.</strong> We know that you may not always have an internet connection when you want to watch your favorite Content.\nDepending on the Service to which you subscribe, Hulu may give you the option to temporarily download certain Content on certain Compatible Devices so that you can watch it while you are offline (\"Temporary Downloads\").\nOf course, there are some limitations that may change from time to time, including: (i) the maximum number of devices that can store Temporary Downloads.\n(ii) the maximum number of Temporary Downloads that can be stored across Compatible Devices at any given time.\n(iii) how long Temporary Downloads will remain available to you.\nand (iv) geographic and device restrictions on playback.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.5 Live TV Service.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Hulu offers multiple Services that provide access to different types of Content.\nFor example, you may subscribe to a Service that provides live TV and other related Content, including on-demand Content (\u201cLive TV Service\u201d).\nIf your subscription includes the Live TV Service, please be aware of following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Home.</strong> When you set your home location as part of registration for and access to the Live TV Service, make sure to designate a residential, non-mobile internet network (\"Home\").\nYour Home will be used to determine which streams are considered \"in-home\" or \"out-of-home,\" where relevant to the requirements of your Service.\nIn addition, for uninterrupted Live TV service, you should access Hulu on your mobile device from your Home location every 30 days, or such other period described in our Help Center at hulu.com/help.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Regional Sports Networks and Local Affiliates.</strong> Your access to regional sports networks, if any, will be determined by your Home, even if you access the Services from outside your Home.\nYour access to live Content from local affiliates, if any, will depend on the location of your device at the time you access the Services.\nFor this reason, among others, you will need to share your mobile device or internet browser\u2019s precise location data with us in order for us to provide you with the Services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertisements.</strong> If you subscribe to multiple Services, the terms of one Service will not impact those of another Service.\nFor example, if you subscribe to both the Live TV Service and another Service featuring Content on-demand without advertisements, you will still see advertisements while streaming Content from the Live TV Service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Live Content Restrictions.</strong> Certain live Content, including sporting events, may be unavailable due to your location, blackouts, or device-specific restrictions set by sports leagues and other parties that control Content rights.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cloud DVR.</strong> Hulu may provide the ability to record live TV Content to your cloud DVR.\nStorage limits for recordings may vary and are applied per account, inclusive of all profiles created under an account.\nIf you want to record live TV Content that will exceed available storage space, we will make room for the newer recordings by automatically deleting older recordings.\nIf your subscription to any Service is cancelled or suspended, you may lose access to previously-made recordings, even if your subscription resumes or is reinstated.\nUnfortunately, Hulu is unable to guarantee error-free recording, storage, or playback.\nOther than your usage of the cloud DVR made available to you by Hulu, you may not record, copy, store, or redistribute any Content.\nYou may only use your cloud DVR to the extent permissible under copyright and other applicable laws.\nPlease visit our Help Center at hulu.com/help to learn more about recording live TV Content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>3.6 The Video Player.</strong> You may not modify, enhance, remove, interfere with, or otherwise alter in any way any portion of the Video Player, its underlying technology, any digital rights management mechanism, device, or other content protection or access control measure incorporated into the Video Player.\nThis restriction includes, without limitation, disabling, reverse engineering, modifying, interfering with or otherwise circumventing the Video Player in any manner that enables users to view the Content without: (i) displaying visibly both the Video Player and all surrounding elements (including the graphical user interface, any advertising, copyright notices, and trademarks) of the Access Point where the Video Player is located.\nand (ii) having full access to all functionality of the Video Player, including, without limitation, all video quality and display functionality and all interactive, elective, or click-through advertising functionality.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.7 Embedding a Video Using the Video Player.</strong> Where Hulu has incorporated an embed option in connection with Content on the Services, you may embed videos using the Video Player, provided you do not embed the Video Player on any website or other location that (i) contains or hosts content that is unlawful, infringing, pornographic, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, vulgar, indecent, profane, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, encourages criminal conduct, gives rise to civil liability, violates any law, rule, or regulation, infringes any right of any third-party including intellectual property rights, or is otherwise inappropriate or objectionable to Hulu (in Hulu's sole discretion), or (ii) links to infringing or unauthorized content (collectively, \"Unsuitable Material\").\nYou may not embed the Video Player into any hardware or software application, even for non-commercial purposes.\nHulu reserves the right to prevent embedding to any website or other location that Hulu finds inappropriate or objectionable (as determined by Hulu in its sole discretion).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.8 Compatible Devices.</strong> In order to access the Services, you will need to use a computer, mobile device, streaming media player, or other device that meets the system and compatibility requirements that we establish from time to time (each, a \u201cCompatible Device\u201d).\nPlease visit our Help Center at hulu.com/help for a current list of Compatible Devices.\nPlease note that Compatible Devices may vary by Service, and may be subject to additional terms.\nFor example, certain devices may not be capable of streaming Content from the Live TV Service but may be capable of streaming other Content.\nFeatures and functionalities that we make available through the Services may also differ by Compatible Device and the terms of your subscription.\nIf you access the Services using a Compatible Device, the third-party that offers that Compatible Device shall be a third-party beneficiary to these Terms, but is not a party to these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.9 Simultaneous Streams.</strong> The number of simultaneous streams of Content that you can access varies by Service and may require device and account verification.\nPlease visit our Help Center at hulu.com/help for the most up to date information on the number of simultaneous streams of Content that are allowed based on the terms of your Service.\nWhere relevant to your Service, \u201cin-home\u201d streams are those that you stream through your Home internet service, and \u201cout-of-home\u201d streams are those that you stream through a connection to a cellular or Wi-Fi network outside of your Home.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.10 Internet Service and Data Usage.</strong> In order to access the Services, you must have a high-speed broadband, wireless or similar internet connection from an internet service provider that meets certain technical specifications.\nPlease note that multiple simultaneous streams, as well as HD and 4K Ultra HD Content, may require higher internet bandwidth.\nYou are responsible for any costs associated with your internet service used to access the Services.\nYour use of the Services may count toward your data usage, depending on the terms of your agreement with your internet service provider.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.11 Your Responsibilities.</strong> In order for us to keep the Services safe and available for everyone to use, we all have to follow the same rules of the road.\nYou agree to observe all restrictions identified in these Terms, including without limitation using the Services in a way that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>violates the

terminate or restrict your account or your use of the Services at any time, without notice or liability, if Hulu determines or reasonably believes in its sole discretion that you have breached these Terms, violated any law, rule, or regulation, engaged in other inappropriate conduct, or for any other business reason.\nOf course, we would prefer to avoid such termination.\nwe may use technical measures to block or restrict your prohibited access to or use of the Services, and you agree not to circumvent, avoid, or bypass such restrictions.\nWe also reserve the right to take appropriate legal action against you, and you acknowledge that you will have caused substantial harm to Hulu and that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult to measure.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.12

additional terms and conditions.\nUnless otherwise provided by these additional terms and conditions, they are hereby incorporated into these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.13

Services are available, will change from time to time.\nHulu reserves the right to replace or remove any Content and Access Points available to you through the Services, including specific titles and networks/channels, and to otherwise make changes in how we operate the Services.\nAdditionally, you agree that for various reasons, such as restrictions from content programmers and other limitations or considerations from third-parties, certain Content and functionality that may be available through one Access Point or Compatible Device may not be available through another Access Point or Compatible Device.\nWe hope not to, but we may change, suspend, or discontinue - temporarily or permanently - some or all of the Services (including the Content and the Compatible Devices through which the Services are accessed), with respect to any or all users, at any time without notice.\nIn our continued assessment of the Services, we may from time to time, with respect to any or all of our users, experiment with or otherwise offer certain features or other elements of the Services, including promotional features, user interfaces, product features and functionality, plans, pricing, and advertisements.\nYou acknowledge that Hulu may do so in Hulu's sole discretion at any time without notice.\nYou also agree that Hulu will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services.</p>\nback to top 4.\nSUBSCRIPTIONS AND BILLING\n<p>\n<strong>4.1.\nOngoing Subscription and Fees.</strong> While we may offer Content from time to time for free, we charge a fee to access the Services.\nWe will bill you in advance for your subscription.\nYour subscription will continue and automatically renew on a recurring basis corresponding to the term of your subscription unless and until you cancel your subscription, or your account is otherwise suspended or terminated pursuant to these Terms.\nHulu reserves the right to change the terms of your

payment method accepted by Hulu, as may be updated from time to time (\"Payment Method\").\nWe will charge your Payment Method a periodic subscription fee on a recurring basis corresponding to the term of your subscription, and any applicable taxes.\nYou are solely responsible for any and all fees charged to your Payment Method.\nWhen you provide a Payment Method, we will attempt to verify the information you entered by processing an authorization hold.\nWe do not charge you in connection with this authorization hold, but your available balance or credit limit may be reduced.\nIf you want to use a different Payment Method than the one you signed up to use during registration, you may edit your Payment Method information by logging in on the Hulu Site and viewing your account details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.3 Billing Holds.</strong> In the event of a failed attempt to charge to your Payment Method (e.g.\nif your Payment Method has expired), we reserve the right to retry billing your Payment Method.\nIn the event that you or we (through our payment service providers) update your Payment Method to remedy a change in validity or expiration date, we will automatically resume billing you for your subscription to the Services.\nWe may suspend or cancel your access to the Services if we remain unable to successfully charge a valid Payment Method.\nWe also reserve the right to pursue any amounts you fail to pay in connection with your subscription, including collection costs, bank overdraft fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorneys' fees, and arbitration or court costs.</p>\n<p>We may offer you the ability to pause your subscription for a specified period of time.\nIf you do not cancel before the end of the pause period, billing will resume automatically.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.4 Billing Period.</strong> As used in these Terms, \u201cbilling\u201d shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method.\nWe will automatically bill your Payment Method on the later of the day you start your subscription or the day your free trial ends, and on each recurring billing date thereafter.\nYour \u201cBilling Period\u201d is the interval of time between each recurring billing date and corresponds to the term of your subscription.\nWhere applicable, charges for one or more Services may be prorated for any partial month of service.\nTo see your next recurring billing date, log in on the Hulu Site and view your account details.\nYou acknowledge that the timing of when you are billed and the amount billed each Billing Period may vary, including if your subscription began on a day not contained in a given month (e.g.\nif you have a monthly subscription and became a paying subscriber on January 31, your Payment Method would next be billed on February 28), due to free trials and other promotional offers, gift card redemptions, credits applied, or changes in your subscription or Payment Method.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.5 Cancellation and Refunds.</strong> You can cancel your subscription by logging into your Hulu account and following the instructions on your account page on the Hulu

recurring billing date in order to avoid being charged.\nIf you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to the Service through the end of your current Billing Period.\nHowever, if you modify your subscription to switch from one Service to another Service during your Billing Period, you may not have continued access to your original Service.\nIf you cancel, including if you switch your billing from Hulu to a third-party, you will also forfeit any service, referral, or redeemed gift card credits.</p>\n<p>Payments are nonrefundable.\nIf you cancel, modify your subscription, or if your account is otherwise terminated under these Terms, you will not receive a credit, including for partially used periods of Service.\nThere are circumstances where Hulu may provide credits on a case by case basis.\nThe amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at Hulu's sole and absolute discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.6 Free Trials.</strong> On occasion, we may offer free trials to a particular Service, subject to specific terms explained during your sign-up.\nYou can view details of your free trial on your Hulu account page.\nHulu reserves the right to determine eligibility for free trials, which may vary based on factors including the Service selected, how recently you redeemed a free trial, and whether the Service is part of a combined offering.\nCertain limitations may also exist with respect to combining free trials with any other offers.\n</p>\n<p>It is very important to understand that you will not receive a notice from Hulu that your free trial has ended and that payment for your subscription is due.\nIf you wish to avoid charges to your Payment Method, you must cancel your subscription prior to midnight Eastern Time on the last day of your free trial period.\nBecause the Services are offered in multiple time zones, for consistency, a \u201cday\u201d for purposes of these Terms begins at 12:00

disclosed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.8 One-Time Pay Per View Events.</strong> We may offer one-time pay per view events in connection with the Services.\nSome of these events may be offered through a

CLAIMS\n<p>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY.\nWE WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\nIf you have an issue with the Services, we encourage you to review our frequently asked questions or contact our customer service team through our Help Center at hulu.com/help.\nIn the event there is an issue that still requires attention, we want to make the resolution process as quick and efficient as possible.\nWe also want to specify now what each of us should expect in order to avoid any confusion later.\nTo that end, you and Hulu agree to first discuss any issue informally for at least 60 days before commencing an arbitration proceeding.\nTo do that, please send your full name and contact information, your concern and your proposed solution by mail to us at: Hulu, LLC, 2500 Broadway, 2nd Floor, Santa Monica, CA 90404- Attn: Legal Department.\nIf we would like to discuss an issue with you, we will contact you using the email address you provided when you registered for Hulu.</p>\n<p>If we do not reach an agreed upon solution after our discussions for at least 60 days, you and Hulu agree that any and all claims, except disputes relating to the ownership or enforcement of intellectual property rights, that either of us may have, whether based on past, present, or future events, arising out of or relating to: (i) these Terms (including formation, performance, or breach of them, and including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision).\n(ii) the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated in these Terms.\n(iii) any aspect of our relationship with each other.\nand (iv) use of the Services, must be resolved through binding arbitration.\nArbitration will be administered by JAMS Mediation, Arbitration, and ADR Services (\u201cJAMS\u201d) in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\u201cJAMS Rules\u201d).\nThe JAMS Rules and instructions about how to initiate an arbitration are available at www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267.\nPlease note that <strong>YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</strong> As an exception to this arbitration agreement, Hulu is happy to give you the right to pursue in small claims court any claim that is within that court's jurisdiction, whether or not you discussed with us informally first, as long as you proceed only on an individual basis.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>YOU AND HULU AGREE TO ARBITRATE IN EACH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ONLY, NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER OF A CLASS, AND EACH OF US EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.\nNo arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of you, Hulu, and any other parties to the arbitration or proceedings.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor your convenience, arbitration may be conducted in-person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.\nProceedings that cannot be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or online, will take place in Los Angeles County, California.\nRather than force everyone to visit us in California, if you can demonstrate that arbitration in California would create an undue burden to you, you are free to initiate the arbitration in your home state.\nIt is important that you understand that the arbitrator's decision will be binding and final (except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act) and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nPlease note that nothing in this Section shall be construed as consent by Hulu to the jurisdiction of any other court with regard to disputes not covered by these Terms.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the JAMS Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or Hulu) is responsible for paying the filing fee.\nHowever, if the arbitrator issues you an award of damages and: (i) that award is greater than the amount of our last written settlement offer.\nor (ii) if we did not make a settlement offer, then in addition to paying for any JAMS Case Management Fees and all professional fees for the arbitrator\u2019s services, we will reimburse you for the filing fees you incurred.</p>\n<p>If you're not sure what all of this means, of course please feel free to ask an attorney.\nSpecifying what happens if an issue arises with one of our users is never a fun topic.\nBut we pride ourselves on transparency and we thank you in advance for understanding why it's important that you and Hulu agree on the process described in this Section.</p>\nback to top 14.\nLIMITATION ON TIME TO BRING A CLAIM\n<p>To help resolve any issues between us promptly, you and Hulu agree to bring any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms (including Hulu\u2019s Privacy Policy), our relationship, or the use of the Services within one year after a claim arises.\notherwise, the claim is waived.\nThis limitation applies regardless of the venue in which such claim is or could otherwise be asserted.</p>\nback to top 15.\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n<p>\n<strong>15.1 International Use.</strong> We are a company based in the United States and offer our Services to users in the United States.\nHulu's goal is to bring you as much Content as is legally available.\nThat said, we are limited by the rights that our content programmers grant to us.\nAccess to the Services from locations where Hulu does not have rights, that are not permitted by the terms of your subscription, or where Hulu does not make the Services available is prohibited.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.2 Export Controls.</strong> Software and the transmission of applicable technical data, if any, in connection with the Services are subject to export controls.\nYou agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding software and the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.3 Choice of Law and Forum.</strong> These Terms are governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.\nTo the extent that the arbitration provision outlined in Section 13 is not applicable (e.g., when confirming an arbitration award), you and Hulu agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the Los Angeles County of the State of California.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.4 No Waiver/Reliance.</strong> If you see other parties violating these Terms, let us know at feedback@hulu.com (subject line: \"TOU Violation\").\nHulu will determine if and how to respond.\nHulu's decision to delay exercising or enforcing any right or remedy under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy with respect to any party.\nEven if Hulu acts in a way that appears to you to be inconsistent with these Terms, Hulu's action shall not be deemed a waiver or constructive amendment of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.5 Integration, Amendment, Severability, and Electronic Communications.</strong> Please note that these Terms, including Hulu's Privacy Policy which is incorporated in these Terms and any end user license agreement that might accompany the applicable Service, constitute the entire legal agreement between you and Hulu and govern your use of the Services (including your use of the Content) (but excludes any services, if any, that Hulu may provide to you under a separate signed written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and Hulu in relation to the Services.\nIn the unlikely event that a customer service representative or material posted to our Help Center provides information that is inconsistent with these Terms, please be aware that these Terms will control.\nThese Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law.\nIf any provision of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, you and we agree that the provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>From time to time, we may communicate with you about the Services and these Terms electronically (e.g., emails to your registered email address, notices on the Hulu Site and other Access Points).\nYou consent to receive electronic communications from Hulu and further agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, and other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any applicable legal notification requirements.\nWe recommend that you keep a copy of any electronic communications we send to you for your records.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.6 Survival.</strong> The provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive cancellation or deletion of your Account shall survive such cancellation or deletion.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read these Terms.\nBy understanding and agreeing to follow these Terms, the experience will be better for all users.\nIt is our goal to provide you with a first class user experience, so if you have any questions or comments about these Terms, please contact us at: legal@hulu.com.\nEnjoy the Services!</p>\nback to top\n<br> ", "created_at": "2019-06-08 15:43:48.722623", "updated_at": "2021-06-27 20:42:29.481649"}], "points": [{"id": 24083, "title": "This service
