comparison feature by police departments in connection with criminal investigations.\nThis moratorium does not apply to use of Amazon Rekognition\u2019s face comparison feature to help identify or locate missing persons.\nFor more information, see our announcement on our Amazon Day One Blog.<br>\n</p> Last Updated: December 8, 2020 <p>The Service Terms below govern your use of the Services.\nCapitalized terms used in these Service Terms but not defined below are defined in the AWS Customer Agreement&nbsp;or other agreement with us governing your use of the Services (the \u201cAgreement\u201d).\nFor purposes of these Service Terms, \u201cYour Content\u201d includes any \u201cCompany Content\u201d and any \u201cCustomer Content,\u201d and \u201cAWS Content\u201d includes \u201cAmazon Properties.\u201d</p> 1.\nUniversal Service Terms (Applicable to All Services) <p>\n<b>1.1.</b> You may not transfer outside the Services any software (including related documentation) you obtain from us or third party licensors in connection with the Services without specific authorization to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.2.</b> You must comply with current technical documentation applicable to the Services (including applicable developer guides) posted on the AWS Site.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.3.</b> You will provide information or other materials related to Your Content (including copies of any client-side applications) as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with the Agreement.\nYou will reasonably cooperate with us to identify the source of any problem with the Services that we reasonably believe may be attributable to Your Content or any end user materials that you control.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.4.</b> In connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining licenses and adhering to the license terms of any software you run.\nIf we reasonably believe any of Your Content violates the law, infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party, or otherwise violates a material term of the Agreement (including the documentation, the Service Terms, or the Acceptable Use Policy) (\u201cProhibited Content\u201d), we will notify you of the Prohibited Content and may request that such content be removed from the Services or access to it be disabled.\nIf you do not remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content within 2 business days of our notice, we may remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content or suspend the Services to the extent we are not able to remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, we may remove or disable access to any Prohibited Content without prior notice in connection with illegal content, where the content may disrupt or threaten the Services or in accordance with applicable law or any judicial, regulatory or other governmental order or request.\nIn the event that we remove Your Content without prior notice, we will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law.\nWe terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.5.</b> You will ensure that all information you provide to us via the AWS Site (e.g., information provided in connection with your registration for the Services, requests for increased usage limits) is accurate, complete, and not misleading.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.6.</b> From time to time, we may apply upgrades, patches, bug fixes, or other maintenance to the Services and AWS Content (\u201cMaintenance\u201d).\nWe agree to use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice of any scheduled Maintenance (except for emergency Maintenance), and you agree to use reasonable efforts to comply with any Maintenance requirements that we notify you about.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.7.</b> If your Agreement does not include a provision on AWS Confidential Information, and you and AWS do not have an effective non-disclosure agreement in place, then you agree that you will not disclose AWS Confidential Information (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement), except as required by law.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.8.</b> You may perform benchmarks or comparative tests or evaluations (each, a \u201cBenchmark\u201d) of the Services.\nIf you perform or disclose, or direct or permit any third party to perform or disclose, any Benchmark of any of the Services, you (i) will include in any disclosure, and will disclose to us, all information necessary to replicate such Benchmark, and (ii) agree that we may perform and disclose the results of Benchmarks of your products or services, irrespective of any restrictions on Benchmarks in the terms governing your products or services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.9.</b> Only the applicable AWS Contracting Party (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement) will have obligations with respect to each AWS account, and no other AWS Contracting Party has any obligation with respect to such account.\nThe AWS Contracting Party for an account may change as described in the Agreement.\nInvoices for each account will reflect the AWS Contracting Party that is responsible for that account during the applicable billing period.</p>\n<p>If, as of the time of a change of the AWS Contracting Party responsible for your account, you have made an up-front payment for any Services under such account, then the AWS Contracting Party you paid such up-front payment to may remain the AWS Contracting Party for the applicable account only with respect to the Services related to such up-front payment.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.10.</b> When you use a Service, you may be able to use or be required to use one or more other Services (each, an \u201cAssociated Service\u201d), and when you use an Associated Service, you are subject to the terms and fees that apply to that Associated Service.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.11.</b> If you process the personal data of End Users or other identifiable individuals in your use of a Service, you are responsible for providing legally adequate privacy notices and obtaining necessary consents for the processing of such data.\nYou represent to us that you have provided all necessary privacy notices and obtained all necessary consents.\nYou are responsible for processing such data in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.12.</b> If you have been charged for a Service for a period when that Service was unavailable (as defined in the applicable Service Level Agreement for each Service), you may request a Service credit equal to any charged amounts for such period.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.13.\n</b>If you are a customer that is subject to the French Politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des systems d\u2019information de sant\u00e9 (PGSSI-S), you agree that your use of the Services complies with the PGSSI-S.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.14.\n</b>Data Protection.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.14.1</b> These Service Terms incorporate the AWS GDPR Data Processing Addendum (\u201cDPA\u201d), when the GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Customer Data (as defined in the DPA).The DPA is effective as of 25 May 2018 and replaces and supersedes any previously agreed data processing addendum between you and AWS relating to the Directive 95/46/EC.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.14.2</b> These Service Terms incorporate the AWS CCPA Terms (\u201cCCPA Terms\u201d), when the CCPA applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Personal Information (as defined in the CCPA Terms).</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.15.</b> Following closure of your AWS account, we will delete Your Content in accordance with the Documentation.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.16.\n</b>Your receipt and use of any Promotional Credits is subject to the AWS Promotional Credit Terms &amp.\nConditions.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.17.\n</b>Payment Currency</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.17.1</b> AWS provides a Service that enables payment in certain currencies (\u201cPayment Currency\u201d) other than United States dollars when you purchase certain Services from AWS (the \u201cCurrency Service\u201d).\nWhen you purchase Services in certain countries outside of the United States, we may require you, because of currency controls or other factors, to use the Currency Service.\nWhen using the Currency Service you are not tendering payment in one currency and receiving from us another currency.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.17.2</b> When you use the Currency Service, Service fees and charges will automatically be invoiced in the Payment Currency.\nYou must pay invoices in the currency specified on each invoice, but, for credit card or debit card purchases, you may only make payments in currencies supported by the issuer of your card.\nIf the issuer of your credit card or debit card does not support the required Payment Currency, you must use a different payment method that does support paying in the Payment Currency.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.17.3</b> Our fees and charges for your use of the Currency Service, if any, are included in the exchange rate applied to your invoice (the \u201cApplicable Exchange Rate\u201d).\nThird-parties, such as your bank, credit card issuer, debit card issuer, or card network, may charge you additional fees.\nThe Applicable Exchange Rate is determined at the time your invoice is generated and, for invoices covering usage of Services over a period of time, will apply to all usage and Service charges listed on that invoice.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.17.4</b> All refunds processed against an invoice will be provided in the currency in which the invoice was generated and reflected as a credit memo or a payment in your Payment Currency.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.17.5</b> You agree that by using the Currency Service, information related to your payment, including your name and address, may be used by our banking partners to process your payments in jurisdictions other than the United States.</p> 2.\nBetas and Previews <p>\n<b>2.1.</b> This Section describes the additional terms and conditions under which you may (a) access and use certain features, technologies, and services made available to you by AWS that are not yet generally available, including, but not limited to, any products, services, or features labeled \u201cbeta\u201d, \u201cpreview\u201d, \u201cpre-release\u201d, or \u201cexperimental\u201d, and any related AWS Content (each, a \u201cBeta Service\u201d) or (b) access and use Services and any related AWS Content available in AWS regions that are not generally available, including, but not limited to, any AWS regions identified by AWS as \u201cbeta\u201d, \u201cpreview\u201d, \u201cpre-release\u201d, or \u201cexperimental\u201d (each, a \u201cBeta Region\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.2.</b> You must comply with all terms

to your access, use, testing, or evaluation of Beta Services or Beta Regions, including observations or information regarding the performance, features, and functionality of Beta Services or Beta Regions (\u201cTest Observations\u201d).\nAWS will own and may use and evaluate all Test Observations for its own purposes.\nYou will not use any Test Observations except for your internal evaluation purposes of any Beta Service or Beta Region.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.4.</b>&nbsp;AWS may suspend or terminate your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region at any time.\nYour access to and use of each Beta Service and Beta Region will automatically terminate upon the release of a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region or upon notice of termination by AWS.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, after suspension or termination of your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region for any reason, (a) you will not have any further right to access or use the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region, and (b) Your Content used in the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region may be deleted or inaccessible.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.5.</b> Test Observations, Suggestions concerning a Beta Service or Beta Region, and any other information about or involving (including the existence of) any Beta Service or Beta Region are considered AWS Confidential Information.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.6.</b>&nbsp;WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMERS IN THE AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE TERMS, BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS ARE NOT READY FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, DEFECTS, OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS.\nACCORDINGLY, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE AGREEMENT OR THESE SERVICES TERMS, AWS IS PROVIDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS TO YOU \u201cAS IS.\u201d AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE REGARDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY THAT THE BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BECOME GENERALLY AVAILABLE, BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT ANY CONTENT,

WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.\nAWS\u2019S AND ITS AFFILIATES\u2019 AND LICENSORS\u2019 AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAY US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR
