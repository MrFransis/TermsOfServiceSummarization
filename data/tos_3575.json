information and forward-looking statements (collectively referred to herein as \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d) within the meaning of applicable Canadian and U.S.\nsecurities laws.\nForward-looking statements and other information are based on Suncor\u2019s current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions that were made by Suncor in light of information available at the time the statement was made and consider Suncor\u2019s experience and its perception of historical trends, including expectations and assumptions concerning: the accuracy of reserves and resources estimates.\ncommodity prices and interest and foreign exchange rates.\nthe performance of assets and equipment.\ncapital efficiencies and cost-savings.\napplicable laws and government policies.\nfuture production rates.\nthe sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities.\nthe availability and cost of labour, services and infrastructure.\nthe satisfaction by third parties of their obligations to Suncor.\nthe execution of projects.\nand the receipt, in a timely manner, of regulatory and third-party approvals.\nIn addition, all other statements and other information that address expectations or projections about the future, and other statements and information about Suncor\u2019s strategy for growth, expected and future expenditures or investment decisions, commodity prices, costs, schedules, production volumes, operating and financial results, future financing and capital activities, and the expected impact of future commitments are forward-looking statements.\nSome of the forward-looking statements may be identified by words such as \u201cobjective\u201d, \u201ctargets\u201d, \u201cestimates\u201d, \u201canticipated\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d, \u201cgoal\u201d, \u201cvision\u201d, \u201cstrategy\u201d, \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cproposed\u201d, \u201cintention\u201d, \u201ccontinue\u201d,

\u201cindicates\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cfocus\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d and variations of such words and similar expressions.</p>\n<p>Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, some that are similar to other oil and gas companies and some that are unique to Suncor.\nSuncor\u2019s actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by its forward-looking statements, so readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them.\nRisks, uncertainties and other factors that could influence the financial and operating performance of Suncor include, but are not limited to, changes in general economic, market and business conditions, such as commodity prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates.\nfluctuations in supply and demand for Suncor\u2019s products.\nthe successful and timely implementation of capital projects, including growth projects and regulatory projects.\ncompetitive actions of other companies, including increased competition from other oil and gas companies or from companies that provide alternative sources of energy.\nlabour and material shortages.\nactions by government authorities, including the imposition or reassessment of taxes or changes to fees and royalties, and changes in environmental and other regulations.\nthe ability and willingness of parties with whom we have material relationships to perform their obligations to us.\noutages to third-party infrastructure that could cause disruptions to production.\nthe occurrence of unexpected events such as fires, equipment failures and other similar events affecting Suncor or other parties whose operations or assets directly or indirectly affect Suncor.\nthe potential for security breaches of Suncor\u2019s information systems by computer hackers or cyberterrorists, and the unavailability or failure of such systems to perform as anticipated as a result of such breaches.\nour ability to find new oil and gas reserves that can be developed economically.\nthe accuracy of Suncor\u2019s reserves, resources and future production estimates.\nmarket instability affecting Suncor\u2019s ability to borrow in the capital debt markets at acceptable rates.\nmaintaining an optimal debt to cash flow ratio.\nthe success of Suncor\u2019s risk management activities using derivatives and other financial instruments.\nthe cost of compliance with current and future environmental laws.\nrisks and uncertainties associated with closing a transaction for the purchase or sale of an oil and gas property, including estimates of the final consideration to be paid or received, the ability of counterparties to comply with their obligations in a timely manner and the receipt of any required regulatory or other third-party approvals outside of Suncor\u2019s control that are customary to transactions of this nature.\nthe accuracy of cost estimates, some of which are provided at the conceptual or other preliminary stage of projects and prior to commencement or conception of the detailed engineering that is needed to reduce the margin of error and increase the level of accuracy.\nthe ability to secure adequate product transportation.\nthe risk of war, hostilities, civil insurrection, political instability and terrorist threats.\nand risks associated with existing and potential future lawsuits and regulatory actions.\nThe foregoing important factors are not exhaustive.</p>\n<p>Although Suncor believes that the expectations represented by such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.\nSuncor\u2019s most recently filed Annual Report, Quarterly Report, Annual Information Form/Form 40-F, and other documents it files from time to time with securities regulatory authorities describe the risks, uncertainties, material assumptions and other factors that could influence actual results and such factors are incorporated herein by reference.</p>\n<p>Copies of these documents are available without charge from Suncor through the following means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>via mail request: 150 6th Avenue S.W., Calgary, Alberta T2P 3Y7,</li>\n<li>by telephone 1 (800) 558-9071,</li>\n<li>via email request to info@suncor.com</li>\n<li>by referring to Suncor\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com/ or EDGAR at www.sec.gov/.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Except as required by applicable securities laws, Suncor disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n<p>Certain financial measures on Suncor\u2019s websites are not prescribed by Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nNon-GAAP measures presented do not have any standardized meaning and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nTherefore, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNon-GAAP measures are included because management uses the information to analyze business performance, leverage and liquidity and therefore may be considered useful information by investors.\nNon-GAAP measures are defined and reconciled in Suncor\u2019s most recent Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis filed with securities regulatory authorities available at www.sedar.com/.</p>\nReserves\n<p>Unless otherwise stated, reserves information presented on Suncor\u2019s websites is presented as Suncor\u2019s working interest (operating and non-operating) before deduction of royalties, and without including any royalty interests of Suncor.\nFor more information on Suncor\u2019s reserves, please see Suncor\u2019s most recent Annual Information Form/Form 40-F filed with securities regulatory authorities available at www.sedar.com/ and www.sec.gov/.</p>\n<p>Certain crude oil and natural gas liquids volumes have been converted to mcfe on the basis of one bbl to six mcf.\nAlso, certain natural gas volumes have been converted to boe or mboe on the same basis.\nAny figure presented in mcfe, boe or mboe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation.\nA conversion ratio of one barrel of crude oil or natural gas liquids to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not necessarily represent value equivalency at the wellhead.\nGiven that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.</p>\nIntellectual Property\n<p>All content on or available through this website is owned
