address.</em>\n</p>\n<p>We store personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when registering at the Site, and further on by editing your profile at the Site.</p>\n<p>The personal information that we store depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Site, the choices you make and the products and features you use.\nThe personal information we store can include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We store username, email address and social media usernames.\nUsername and email address are mandatory.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Credentials.\nWe store passwords.\nAll of the Credentials are hashed and original values not stored.<br>\n</li>\n<li>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Information automatically stored</strong>\n<p>\n<em>In Short: Certain information \u2013 such as IP address and/or browser and device characteristics \u2013 is stored automatically when you visit our websites.</em>\n</p>\n<p>We automatically store certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Site.\nThis information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, information about how and when you use our Site and other technical information.\nThis information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Site, and for our internal analytic and reporting purposes.</p>\n<p>We\u2019d like to state that there are 2 different automatic storing mechanisms:</p>\n<p>The first one is default server log which contains this information, and is flushed every 24 hours.<br>\nThis is primarily needed for security and maintaining the operation of the Site.</p>\n<p>The second one is used by style statistics and only happens on certain portions of the site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>https://userstyles.world/style/:id/:name</code>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>https://userstyles.world/api/style/:id.user.css</code>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By visiting the relative links stated above, we save a unique hash combined of your IP address, the style ID, reffered within the relative link as <code>:id</code>, and a secret key.\nThis unique hash is not easily reversible without brute-forcing all public IP addresses in IPv4 address space and our secret key.\nThis provides decently accurate style statistics while still respecting your privacy.</p> HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION? <p>\n<em>In Short: We process your information for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of our contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.</em>\n</p>\n<p>We use personal information stored via our Site for a variety of business purposes described below.\nWe process your personal information for these

information to send you product, service and new feature information and/or information about changes to our terms, conditions, and policies;<br>\n</li>\n<li>Request feedback [for our Service Purposes and/or with your Consent]: We may use your information to request feedback and/or to contact you about your use of our Site.<br>\n</li>\n<li>To protect our Site [for Service Purposes and/or Legal
