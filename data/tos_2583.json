law.\nWhen we no longer need to use Personal Information, we will remove it from our systems and records and/or take steps to anonymize it so that you can no longer be identified from it.</p>\n<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal

Store.\nSuch terms of use may prohibit you from doing some of the things you are permitted to do under this Agreement or permit you to do some of the things you are prohibited from doing under this Agreement.\nIn addition, application of the App Store\u2019s terms of use may result in other terms of this Agreement not being applicable to the Software or applying in a different way than this Agreement states.\nIf your use of the Software is subject to an App Store\u2019s terms of use, then in the event of any conflict or ambiguity between the terms of this Agreement and such App Store\u2019s terms of use, the App Store\u2019s terms of use will govern, but only to the extent necessary to resolve such conflict or ambiguity, and the terms of this Agreement will otherwise remain

with updated Software data files automatically to benefit you, such as to provide you with updated device information to identify new devices in your network.\nThese data files do not update your firmware but consist of Software files that are cached on your Product and override older files.\nBy agreeing to this Agreement, you agree to automatic updates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>DATA

the date that you accept this Agreement</strong> (the \u201cOpt-Out Deadline\u201d).\nIn order to opt out of mandatory arbitration, you must (i) mail written notification to Belkin International,
