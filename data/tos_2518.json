Enforcement Guidelines, FamilyTreeDNA may create limited access law enforcement accounts (\u201cLE Accounts\u201d) which are permitted to upload genetic information to the database to identify the remains of a deceased individual or to identify the perpetrator of a homicide or sexual assault.\nFamilyTreeDNA will track Law Enforcement Accounts via an in-house identification system that will allow users to opt out of Law Enforcement Matching.\n</p>\n<p> Users will only be viewable to the law enforcement account if ALL of the following requirements are met: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user has opted into matching</li>\n<li>The user has not opted out of Law Enforcement Matching</li>\n<li>The user and the law enforcement account have the same matching levels selected</li>\n<li>The user is genetic relative (also referred to as a match or DNA relative) to the genetic file uploaded to the law enforcement account</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> If a law enforcement account is a genetic relative and meets the above requirements, the information of yours that they will have access to is identical to that of your other matches.\nFor further information on what Personal Information matches may see, please visit the Learning Center.\n</p>\n<p> Law enforcement accounts cannot join or participate in Group Projects.\nIf you opt out of Law Enforcement Matching, law enforcement accounts will not be able to see you as a match or view any personal information viewable by matches.\nYou have the ability to adjust your Law Enforcement Matching preferences at any time in your Privacy &amp.\nSharing settings located in your Account Settings.\n</p>\n<p> Please note, if you decline to participate in law enforcement matching, we may still be required to share your Personal

and their authorized representatives.\nAny other use of the matching database for law enforcement purposes violates our Terms of Service.\nAlthough FamilyTreeDNA relies on law enforcement officials and authorized representatives to identify themselves when requesting use of the site and FamilyTreeDNA has implemented controls to identify and prevent uses of the Services which violate our Terms of

interesting.\nIn other cases, it may lead to distress.\nExamples may involve: (i) information about your origins that contradicts prior assumptions.\n(ii) the discovery of an unknown relative.\nor (iii) discovering unexpected genetic information about a potential health condition.\nAs a user, you take responsibility for all possible consequences that could result from the use of these Services.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory process may result in errors:</strong> We run and operate our own CLIA certified lab at our headquarters in Houston, TX where we place great attention on quality.\nRegardless of our attention to quality, from time to time and although rare, there are cases where issues may occur in our lab processing.\nThese issues may be a result of a contaminated sample, insufficient DNA due to a tester not following swab instructions, or most rarely, misidentification.\nIf you believe your sample was misidentified, please contact Customer Service for help as this can affect your privacy.\nPlease see our Retesting and Return Policies as well as our Privacy Statement for further information about how we handle your Genetic Information.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Genetics is an evolving field of research:</strong> Currently, only a small percentage of the hundreds of thousands of data points we measure from your DNA are known to be associated with human traits or health conditions, and we may not know or comprehend all of the genetic contributions for a trait.\nThe research community is quickly learning more about genetics as we discover new links between genes and traits.\nAt times, research is also showing that some previously identified links may not be valid.\nIn addition, many ethnic groups are not included in genetic studies.\nBecause interpretations provided in our service depend on scientific studies, you may receive interpretations that are based on populations that might not apply to you.\nIn the future, scientific research may change the interpretation of your DNA and the scientific community may show past research to be incomplete or inaccurate.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Your Use of the Services <p> The Services includes tools that provide you with ethnicity and other genetically related results as well as accompanying
