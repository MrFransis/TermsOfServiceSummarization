In the Surveys, Meadow Park CBD or a third party (a \"Third Party\") may ask an individual to provide various information to Meadow Park CBD, which may include his or her name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and such other information as may be requested from time to time (together, \"Survey Information\").\nMeadow Park CBD may also collect information concerning an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with information provided from this web site.\nCompleting the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to Meadow Park CBD or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives from Meadow Park CBD or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to Meadow Park CBD</p> 1.2 Third Party List Information.\n<p>Meadow Park CBD collects information from individuals when an individual provides information to a third party and Meadow Park CBD subsequently purchases, licenses, or otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the \"Seller\").\nSuch purchased information may include, but is not limited to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, credit card information, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have provided to the Seller (together, \"Third Party List Information\").\nWhen acquiring Third Party List Information,Meadow Park CBD seeks assurances from the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information to Meadow Park CBD and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.</p> 1.3 Other Information.\n<p>Other occasions when Meadow Park CBD obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered by Meadow Park CBD or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests assistance through Meadow Park CBD's customer service department, and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Meadow Park CBD service or newsletter (together, \"Other Information\").</p> 1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.\n<p>Meadow Park CBD currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database.\nAdditionally, Meadow Park CBD may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, \"Technology Information\").</p>\n<p>(a) Cookies.</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows Meadow Park CBD to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in Meadow Park CBD 's database.\nYou may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com.\nIndividuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.</p>\n<p>(b) Web Beacons.</p>\n<p>A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using a programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database.\nThis allows Meadow Park CBD to track certain web sites an individual visits online.\nWeb beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes.\nFor example, Meadow Park CBD might place, with the consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website where fishing products are sold.\nWhen Joe, an individual listed in Meadow Park CBD's database, visits the fishing website, Meadow Park CBD receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the fishing site, and Meadow Park CBD would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in fishing.\nMeadow Park CBD may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Joe.\nIn addition to using web beacons on web pages, Meadow Park CBD also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Meadow Park CBD's database.</p>\n<p>(c) New Technology.</p>\n<p>The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is Meadow Park CBD's use of new and evolving technology.\nAs a result, Meadow Park CBD strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.</p> 1.5

will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13.\nIf Meadow Park CBD obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.\nBecause it does not collect such information, Meadow Park CBD has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.\nMeadow Park CBD has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\").</p> 1.8 Credit Card Information.\n<p>Meadow Park CBD may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card (\"Credit Card Information\") when an individual places an order from Meadow Park CBD When the Credit
