Browser Privacy Policy <p>\n<em>Our company does not store any record of people\u2019s browsing history.\nWe don\u2019t write any personal data to the blockchain.\nThe only way a user\u2019s data is stored by Brave is if the user has switched on Rewards or Sync.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Read this document to understand how the Brave Browser uses data.</p>\n<p>To learn how we use data to operate our websites, forums, and communications, visit the Website Privacy Policy.\nTo learn how we use data for publishers and creators visit the Publisher Privacy Policy on the Basic Attention Token website.</p>\n<p>In this policy \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, etc.\nrefers to Brave Software Inc, while \u201cBrave\u201d refers to the browser.</p> Security &amp.\nupdates <i>\n</i>\n<p>Brave automatically checks with us for updates.\nThis ensures that you always have access to the latest security fixes.\nWe count the number and type of these requests when we receive them to produce aggregate statistics.\nNo particular person\u2019s information can be identified in the statistics we produce.</p>\n<p>You can also update to the latest version here.</p> Sync <i>\n</i>\n<p>If you switch on Sync then your bookmarks (and soon passwords and other data) will be saved in an encrypted file on a cloud storage service, to which you will have the only decryption key.\nThe data<sup>1</sup> are entirely inaccessible to Brave and to the cloud storage provider.\nLearn how to switch on Sync here.\n(Note that only Brave version 0.59 and above have the Sync feature.\nYou can update to the latest version here.)</p> Location <i>\n</i>\n<p>If you use Brave to visit a website that wants to determine your location, you will be asked whether you want it to be allowed to know where you are.\nIf you click yes to this message, then the website will be sent an approximation of where you are based on your IP address.\nYour IP address will not be stored by Brave, but it may be stored by the website you have visited.\nSee data processing detail.</p> Brave Rewards <i>\n</i>\n<p>If you switch on Brave Rewards you are assigned a \u201cwallet\u201d identifier by Uphold, our payments partner.\nWe record this identifier on servers operated by Amazon and Heroku (a Salesforce company) in the United States.\nThese services are operated in the United States, and are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement, which provides safeguards intended to be equivalent to those provided in the EU.</p>\n<p>Brave uses your wallet identifier to determine when to send you a monthly gift of attention tokens (BAT).\nYou can disable this in Preferences or Settings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> you can quickly access settings by copying <strong>\n<em>brave://rewards</em>\n</strong> into your address bar.\nLearn how Brave Rewards works here.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Each time Brave sends users a monthly gift of BAT it makes a record of their IP addresses that can be analysed to safeguard against fraud.&nbsp;Brave checks to see whether we are currently offering tokens to Brave users.\nThis request includes the identifier of your unique Rewards wallet.\nSee data processing detail.</p>\n<p>Even with Brave Rewards enabled, we never collect your browsing history or similar information, and we can\u2019t derive this information from your contributions to content creators and sites.\nInstead, we aggregate contributions among all Brave users, and we cannot trace contributions to individual users, or link any of your contributions together.</p>\n<p>If you verify ownership of your Brave Rewards wallet with Uphold, direct contributions you make will be processed by Uphold as part of your Uphold account.\nWhen you make a direct contribution, Brave sends all the details of that transaction to Uphold so that they can execute the transaction.\nThis is subject to Uphold\u2019s privacy policy.</p> Ads <i>\n</i>\n<p>If you switch on Brave Rewards and switch on ads (in Rewards settings) you will receive notifications promoting ads, and BAT to reward you for viewing those ads.\nWhile the ads you see are based on interests inferred from your browsing, Brave Ads is private and anonymous.\nThe data are stored on your device, and are inaccessible to us.\nNo data that identifies you or that can be linked to you as an individual leaves the Brave browser on your device.\nIn the cases where we collect high-level statistics relating to web activity data (e.g.\nwhat are the estimated amount of ads that can be served to different content categories that users encounter as they browse the web) we use proven privacy mechanisms like local differential privacy that guarantee that no information about individual users will ever be revealed to us.\nRead more about how we achieve this with Privacy Preserving Product Analytics and Private Advertising Analytics.\nTo read more about Brave Ads and privacy have a look at our FAQ.</p> Brave Today <i>\n</i>\n<p>Brave Today is a private content feed integrated into the browser.\nWhile the content is collected from a content server and the content sort order is informed by your recent browsing activity, Brave Today is private and anonymous.</p>\n<p>Content for the Brave Today feed is collected securely by your device through a private and encrypted proxy method.\nThe proxy removes IP addresses before passing the encrypted request to the content server which sends the encrypted reply back to the browser through the proxy.\nThe feed is temporarily stored on your device, and it is replaced upon starting or refreshing your Brave Today session.\nNo personal data, behavior activity or browsing history ever leaves the Brave browser on your device.\nYour Brave Today sessions are not logged or saved.\nSee data processing detail.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note:</strong> IP addresses are only shared between the user\u2019s browser and the independent proxy which subsequently drops them.\nAt no point does Brave have access to users' IP addresses used for content requests for Brave Today.</p> Brave Together <i>\n</i>\n<p>Brave Together is a private video conference tool that you can use to call with your friends and colleagues.\nNothing that you say or type in the service is logged or saved.\nSee data processing detail.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note:</strong> Your IP address is available to your Internet provider.\nIf your Internet provider requires the use of a TURN server, then your IP address will also be available to a company called 8\u00d78, which operates the TURN server.\nThe content of your call is encrypted between your browser and the Brave server, so your audio and video stay private from intermediaries.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To avoid scams:</strong> For the avoidance of phishing attacks, note that we at Brave never contact Brave Browser users in a Together call.</p> Brave Firewall + VPN on iOS <i>\n</i>\n<p>Users of Brave on iOS can switch on Brave Firewall + VPN.\nThis is operated on Brave\u2019s behalf by Guardian.\nSee data processing detail.</p> How we improve Brave <i>\n</i> Crash reports <i>\n</i>\n<p>When Brave crashes, it creates a report that can be sent to us to help us fix whatever caused the problem.\nThis report contains technical information about your computer system which is typically distinctive.\nWe use a service called Backtrace.io to store them.\nYou can choose whether to send us these reports.\nEven if you have chosen to send reports in the past, you can turn off future reports in settings.</p> Privacy Preserving Product Analytics <i>\n</i>\n<p>The Browser sends us anonymous reports to alert us to product problems and necessary improvements.\nNone of the information it reports harms your privacy.\nThe report only describes general use of the Browser, such as a general range of how many extensions are installed, a general range of how many tabs are open, and whether features like Shields, Rewards, and Ads are switched on.\nSee the full list of questions here.\nThese reports are stripped of metadata, and aggregated with measurements reported by many other instances of Brave.\nThe data are not personal, and cannot be combined to identify you.\nYou can deactivate Privacy-Preserving Product Analytics in Settings.</p> Your feedback <i>\n</i>\n<p>If you write feedback for Brave, we will use this to improve the product.\nSee data processing detail.</p> Nightly, Dev, and Beta browser versions <i>\n</i>\n<p>Nightly, Dev, and Beta versions of the Brave Browser are experimental previews of new Brave Browser versions.\nThey allow us to test new features so that we can find and fix errors before releasing a new version of the Brave Browser.\nThese test versions of the Browser may automatically send crash reports to Brave so that we can identify and fix problems.\nA crash report can contain personal information.\nSee data processing details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How to switch this feature off.</strong>\nYou can switch off \u201cAutomatically send usage statistics and crash reports to Brave Software\u201d in settings.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;you can quickly access settings by copying <em>\n<strong>brave://settings</strong>\n</em>&nbsp;into your address bar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These incomplete versions of Brave represent unfinished and untested work on future versions of Brave, and their incomplete behavior may not be adequately described by this policy.\nMore information about the safety &amp.\nreliability of pre-release versions of Brave can be found in our development documentation.</p> Location Purpose of processingCategories of personal

creator who has a YouTube or Twitch account, or owns a website, Brave has a function that allows you to automatically receive gifts of BAT from Brave itself, and from your visitors.\nBrave tallies BAT donations to each website and channel (i.e.\nYouTube channel, Twitch channel, etc.) anonymously.</p>\n<p>Contributions to creators that have not signed up with Brave will be reserved on the device.\nNo data about these creators or the attention spent on their sites will be transmitted to us at Brave.\nThe data and all of the logic surrounding it will be entirely \u201cclient-side\u201d (i.e.\non the device only).</p>\n<p>To collect Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) you must create a Brave Rewards account on this site.\nThis involves entering your name, email address, and phone number.\nIt is also necessary to demonstrate that you are the owner of the site(s) or channel(s) for which you receive BAT.\nThis is done by providing information from your web server or DNS provider.\nWe may authenticate your credentials with the site that hosts your channel.</p>\n<p>Before you can redeem BAT you will have to connect your Brave Rewards account to Uphold or Gemini, a payments service.\nUphold or Gemini, based on your selection, will then tell us whether your account is in good standing, the list of currencies you have configured, and your preferred currency.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Security</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We record IP addresses when requests are made to identify &amp.\nprevent fraud and to protect the integrity of the service.\nWe also monitor how the account is used, for anti fraud and to maintain the reliability and performance of the service.</p> E-mail <i>\n</i>\n<p>If you ask us to keep in touch with you by email, we will use SendGrid or MailChimp to contact you.\nThis is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement, which provides safeguards intended to be equivalent to those provided in the EU.\nEvery email we send like this includes an unsubscribe link.</p> Minimum age to join Uphold or Gemini <i>\n</i>\n<p>The minimum age to join Uphold is 18 years old.\nThe minimum age to join Gemini is also 18 years old.</p>

the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.\ncopyright law.\nIf you believe in good faith that any Content made available in connection with the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the Content be removed, or access to it blocked as set forth below (see https://www.copyright.gov/&nbsp;for further details).\nIt is Brave\u2019s policy to (1) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users.\nand (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.\nThe address of Brave\u2019s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (\u201cDesignated Agent\u201d) is listed at the end of this policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nProcedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:</strong> If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Brave Service infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below: 1.\nA physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed.\n2.\nIdentification of works or materials being infringed.\n3.\nIdentification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Brave is capable of finding and verifying its existence.\n4.\nContact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address.\n5.\nA statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (3) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand 6.\nA statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nOnce Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent:</strong> It is Brave\u2019s policy: 1.\nto remove or disable access to the infringing material.\n2.\nto notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material.\nand 3.\nthat repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Brave will terminate such content provider\u2019s, member\u2019s or user\u2019s access to the service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nProcedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</strong> If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner\u2019s agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below: 1.\nA physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user.\n2.\nIdentification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.\n3.\nA statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material.\nand 4.\nContent provider\u2019s, member\u2019s or user\u2019s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider\u2019s, member\u2019s or user\u2019s address is located, or if the content provider\u2019s, member\u2019s or user\u2019s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Brave is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</p>\n<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Brave\u2019s may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Brave may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days.\nUnless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Brave\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Notices and counter notices with respect to the Service should be sent to Brave
