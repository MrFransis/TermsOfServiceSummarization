services and who is liable for what.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Rights of Use</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) Our products and services, especially our databases and the computer programs we use are

\u201cUrhG\u201d] remain unaffected.</p>\n<p>(2) The rights of use for our products and services do not give you the right</p>\n<ol>\n<li>to rent, lease, lend, reproduce, resell or otherwise distribute or pass on our products and services or access thereto, not even via the Internet or a downstream public or private data network;</li>\n<li>to use our products and services to develop other

program needs to be downloaded or sent as an exception in order to use our products and services (e.g.\nby a plugin, add-on or app), you will not acquire any proprietary rights to the copy.\nMoreover, the right of use is simple, non-transferable and non-sublicensable, and is limited to the term of the user agreement.\nIf our products and services are discontinued in whole or in part, you are obliged to immediately delete the program provided to you, as well as any source code.\nSince the right of use is limited to you personally, you may not allow third parties to use our products and services via your access, unless you conclude a separate agreement with us or have our written consent for this.</p>\n<p>(4) If there is no copyright or other proprietary rights to our products and services for legal reasons, the provisions of EULA and, secondly, the rights of use provisions in these GTCs apply accordingly.</p>\n<p>(5) The provisions of Sections 69d (2) and (3).\n69e UrhG remain unaffected.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Use Limitations / Right to Exemption</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) The use of third-party services or content that you retrieve using our products and services are subject to contractual relationships exclusively between you and the providing third party.\nWe do not represent these providers and do not intermediate for any of their services.</p>\n<p>(2) Our products and services may not be used for commercial purposes or purposes other than the ones we describe, unless expressly permitted by us in writing or you and we have a contract for such use.\nYou may not advertise using our products and services or indicate a trade or commercial relationship with us, if this is not true.\nYou are prohibited from manipulating our products and services by whichever means (scripts, programs, bypassing access barriers (hacking, among others)).</p>\n<p>(3) You guarantee not to use our products and services for illegal purposes, in particular to crate the following content:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>content that, in terms of its content and/or objective, incites hate against parts of the population or against a national, racial, religious, or tradition-based

group mentioned above;</li>\n<li>content that describes children or young people in an unnatural and explicitly sexual positions, that is pornographic, in particular if it focuses on violence, sexual abuse of children and young people or sexual activities of humans with animals.\nas well as content that violates the regulations on youth protection for other reasons, in particular content within the meaning of the relevant norms of the German Interstate Treaty on the Protection of Minors.\nthis also applies to content that even just refer to or insinuate such content and/or objectives;</li>\n<li>content that advertises games that require a state permit (in particular, gambling activities in accordance with Section 284 StGB [German Criminal Code], or involves or advertises chain letters, pyramid or Ponzi schemes, betting or related things, but this does not apply to legal gambling, if there is a separate contract between you and us;</li>\n<li>content with threatening, offensive, slanderous or otherwise defamatory material and/or racist or xenophobic tendencies;</li>\n<li>content that infringes upon the right to protection of privacy and the personal space and/or otherwise upon the general personality right and/or threatens or pressures others in any way or would put them under pressure if it were to be carried out;</li>\n<li>content that violates the rights of third parties to their image;</li>\n<li>content that violates positions of third parties protected by copyright and/or ancillary copyright (e.g.\nphotos, for to which you do not have the

authorization and making them available to others.\nSuch use of our products and services is prohibited.</p>\n<p>(5) You have to refrain from any activities which aim to disrupt our products and services.</p>\n<p>(6) You agree to indemnify, hold harmless and exempt Cliqz International GmbH and its affiliates in accordance with Sections 15ff.\nAktG [German Stock Corporation Act] from all third-party claims against us due to your culpable breach of one of the obligations listed in this Section 6.</p>\n<p>(7) You agree to bear the reasonable costs of legal defense against the third-party claims described in Section 6 (6).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Control and Blocking of User Accounts</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) Generally, we DO NOT control what Internet services you retrieve or visit using our products and services.\nFor this reason, we also do not assume any liability for your use of our products and services.\nHowever, it is possible that we are bound by law to prevent access to certain online content.\nWe will indicate this to you in an appropriate manner.</p>\n<p>(2) If there is a concrete indication that a user is breaching or has breached Sections 5 or 6 of these GTCs, we have the right to respond as follows, in consideration of and weighing the interests of the corresponding users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will always take into consideration the severity of the breach and the degree of user\u2019s culpability when choosing a sanction for a breach of the GTCs.</li>\n<li>We will warn the user in advance if this is appropriate as the mildest measure in an individual case.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, if the suspicion that a user has breached Section 5 or 6 is confirmed, we can block the user\u2019s access completely or partially and for a certain time or even permanently delete it.\nA user account is deleted only in case of an intentional breach of these GTCs, committed repeatedly or with the intent of causing damage or for personal enrichment.\nIf a user is blocked by us or their user account is deleted, this block is aimed at this user as a person and not just at the relevant username, e-mail address or corresponding user account they used.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(3) If statutory requirements are met, we always have the right to extraordinary cancellation of the contract with the user with immediate effect.\nAdditional and further claims, in particular claims for damages, remain unaffected.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Availability of our Products and Services</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) The gratuitous use of our products and services is offered to users subject to availability.\nWe make an effort to ensure that the user is provided gratuitous services without disruptions.\nUse may be limited or temporarily interrupted as a result of maintenance work, further development or other disruptions.\nIf this is the case, it does not give rise to claims for damages against us.</p>\n<p>(2) In the case of fee-based offers of our products and services, we fulfill our contract with you in accordance with the concrete product specifications.\nWe try to ensure the highest possible availability, but our products and services are mainly software services that undergo constant changes.\nUse may be limited or temporarily interrupted as a result of maintenance work, further development or other disruptions.\nIf this is the case, it does not give rise to claims for damages against us.\nStatutory warranty claims under German law and in case of an express assumption of a guarantee by us remain unaffected.\nIn no case are we liable for disruptions of your Internet connection or disruptions on the part of your provider or disruptions due to force majeure.</p>\n<p>(3) Furthermore, we have the right to change or discontinue the offered free services and performance at any time at our own discretion without notice.\nFee-based services can be discontinued any time after the expiry of the agreed period of performance.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Our Liability</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) Our products and services protect your privacy in the scope indicated in the corresponding specifications.\nFor this purpose, we implement the measures described in the specifications, the privacy policy and these GTCs.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee that third parties are unable to bypass these measures and your information is always absolutely protected from access by third parties.</p>\n<p>(2) Under contracts for fee-based services, we are only liable, subject to statutory rules, for damages to the user that have been caused intentionally or with gross negligence, that are the consequence of non-availability of a guaranteed specification of the service, that are the result of a culpable injury to health, body or life, or that are subject to compulsory liability under the law, in particular liability under the German Product Liability Act.</p>\n<p>(3) For other damages, the liability in case of a breach of a material contractual obligation (known as a cardinal obligation) is limited to damages that have to be typically and foreseeably expected in the scope of provision of a service such as the contractual service.</p>\n<p>(4) Cardinal obligations are contractual obligations whose performance enables the proper implementation of the contract at all and the adherence to which the contractual parties can usually rely on, and the breach of which, on the other hand, jeopardizes the achievement of the contractual aim.</p>\n<p>(5) Under contracts for free services, regardless of the provisions of Sections 9 (1) to 9 (3), we are only liable for intent and gross negligence in accordance with the statutory liability scope of Section 521 BGB [German Civil Code].</p>\n<p>(6) Apart from that, liability against us as well as against our performing or vicarious agents is excluded regardless of the legal reason for such liability.</p>\n<p>(7) If damages to the user result from the loss of data, we are not liable for this if the damages could be prevented through regular, complete back-up of all relevant data by the user, with a frequency appropriate to the value of the data.\nIn case of liability, we are liable only for the damages that would occur with regular, complete back-up of all relevant data, with a frequency appropriate to the value of the data.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Warranty</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any warranty claims arising based on the nature of the service concerned, applicable statutory rules generally apply.\nHowever, the warranty period is reduced to one year, except in the case of claims for damages due to defects, resulting from non-availability of a guaranteed specification of the service, resulting from a culpable injury to health, body or life, or that are subject to liability under the Product Liability Act.\nWe do not assume guarantees.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Fee-based Services</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following addition provisions apply to fee-based offers:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.1.\nContract Conclusion</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) The contract for the use of our fee-based content or services arises upon registration for the desired and chosen payment system provider, agreement to the GTCs and the corresponding acceptance by us.</p>\n<p>(2) By registering for a fee-based service and completing the entry of the corresponding payment information in the system, you are submitting a binding offer to conclude a contract for the provision of the respective service.\nDescriptions of services on our internet pages or in our mobile application are only a non-binding invitation to you to submit a corresponding offer.</p>\n<p>(3) Acceptance by us takes place at the latest once access to the fee-based functions or parts is open to you.\nWe accept or reject your offer, in our sole discretion.\nWe reserve the right to make fee-based offers only accessible in certain regions.\nThis is based mainly, but not exclusively, on whether we can guarantee the payment of taxes to the respective authorities.\nYou have no claim to us offering a fee-based service in your region.</p>\n<p>(4) You can read in the specifications of the chosen product whether the respective fee-based offer is subject to a one-time payment or is automatically extended if it is not canceled and therefore is subject to a recurrent payment.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.\nRight to Withdraw</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are the consumer and maintain a residence within the EU or the European Economic Area, you have a 14-day right to withdraw.\nYou can find the withdrawal instructions and the template withdrawal form in Sections 17 and 18 of these GTCs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.3.\nCosts</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) The prices of individual performance, services and content that we offer are found in the respective offer.\nThe indicated prices include the respective applicable statutory value-added tax, if your place of residence or registered office or the place of your permanent residence is within the European Union or the European Economic Area or in another location subject to a law that prescribes the specification of a total price.</p>\n<p>(2) If your place of residence or registered office or the place of your permanent residence is in the USA or in another country where the specification of net prices is prescribed or common, then are prices exclude the applicable statutory value-added tax.</p>\n<p>(3) The differences in the price presentation are determined by our payment service software using your geographic information based on your IP address.\nTherefore, for a correct presentation of the prices, you have to register without using anonymization software (e.g.\nVPN connections, TOR browser).\nA claim to lower prices or withdrawal due to incorrect price information is therefore excluded if the incorrect prices are shown due to a hardware or software used by you that makes it impossible for us to show you the correct prices.</p>\n<p>(4) The prices for any recurrent payments may reduce or increase in the course of the user\u2019s subscription.\nSuch changes do not affect the ongoing contractual periods.\nA price increase that occurs during an ongoing contractual period is effective only once the user agrees to it.\nOtherwise, your current contract will expire at the end of the ongoing contractual period without the need for a notice of cancellation by one of the parties.</p>\n<p>(5) Reduced prices for testing periods (e.g.\na reduced price during the minimum contractual term) may be taken advantage of only once per person.</p>\n<p>(6) The costs for the respective contractual period are payable to us in advance and due immediately after completion of the order and, thereafter, by the start of the next contractual period.</p>\n<p>(7) The term cannot be interrupted.\nTherefore, a reimbursement of the payments made for such interruptions is not considered either.</p>\n<p>(8) Various payment options may be offered (e.g.\ncredit card, debit or PayPal), but we are not obliged to do so.\nCurrently, we are using Stripe as a payment service provider, which is completely free of charge for you.\nFor payment processing via payment system providers (e.g.\nPayPal), only the terms and conditions of that payment system provider apply.\nin addition, the user may need to have an account with that provider.\nThe payment process may also be offered, supported and simplified by other service providers that provide what is known as \u201csingle sign-on solutions\u201d.</p>\n<p>(9) After a purchase, the user can receive a receipt for the ordered services in electronic format to the e-mail address provided by him.</p>\n<p>(10) If the user does not meet his payment obligations or reverses or charges back the amounts paid, we have the right, regardless of other claims, to block the user\u2019s access to our products and services in full or with respect to the fee-based content or services.\nIf access is blocked due to outstanding payments and the user settles them, access will be restored.\nFurthermore, we can limit or block access to free services in full or in part for payers who are in default.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.4.\nWarranty for Fee-based Services</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) If, contrary to expectations, you would like to complain about our fee-based services due to incomplete or defective performance, you would have to make the complaints according to the terms of use of your chosen payment system provider either to us or to the payment provider immediately after learning about the incomplete or defective performance.</p>\n<p>(2) If we are liable due to justified and timely complaints, we will complete performance in case of an incomplete one and improve or replace at our discretion in case of defective performance.\nYou may request the reduction of fees if we refused improvement attempts or replacement performance, if they are impossible or otherwise definitively failed.</p>\n<p>(3) Apart from that, the statutory defect rights according to German law apply.</p>\n<p>(4) If you are not a consumer as defined in Section 13 BGB, the warranty is limited to one year, except in the case of a building or a product used for buildings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.5.\nCancellation of Fee-based Services</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) Fee-based services can be cancelled by both parties at the end of each contractual period.\nThe term is indicated in the individual offers.</p>\n<p>(2) Generally, please make all cancellations according to these GTCs using your dashboard, which you will find in the plugin.\nIf you cannot log in to the dashboard for whichever reason, please send us an e-mail from your e-mail address that you used to register with us.</p>\n<p>(3) Our fee-based services usually have a specific minimum contractual term starting on the day of contract conclusion.\nThe minimum contractual term applicable to the service in question and/or the different minimum contractual terms that may be offered to the user are found in our offer.\nDepending on the offer and the chosen payment method, the corresponding contract is then extended automatically for the respective minimum contractual term, subject to other agreements, but for a maximum of one year each time, unless it is canceled at the latest one day before the expiry of the minimum contractual term or the ongoing extension term.</p>\n<p>(4) In the case of payment methods that do not allow for an automatic contract extension and regular charges, the contractual term ends automatically upon expiry of the contractual term without the need for a cancellation notice.</p>\n<p>(5) If we make it possible for you to switch to another of our services during an existing contract, a new contractual term for the new contract begins overall with the period of the respective minimum term of the new offer.\nIn turn, Section 11.5.\n(3) and (4) applies to the new contractual term.\nAs a result, the contractual term may be extended without the possibility of a prior regular cancellation in the \u201cold\u201d contractual period.\nPayments already made will be generally offset against the invoice for the new contractual period.</p>\n<p>(6) Both parties may terminate the contract with immediate effect for an important reason.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Technical Requirements</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) You need a computer or a mobile device with internet access to be able to use our services.</p>\n<p>(2) The respective specifications for our products and services contain the corresponding hardware and software requirements that your system must meet in order to be able to use the respective product.\nThese are the minimal conditions necessary to be able to offer the products and services in a stable manner at all.\nHowever, a limited user experience (e.g.\nsystem slowdown) may be associated with these minimal conditions.\nTherefore, we recommend having a system configuration that exceeds our minimum requirements.</p>\n<p>(3) You are responsible for checking whether your system meets the technical requirements in order to be able to use our services.\nWe recommend that you check this before ordering our fee-based services.\nWe have the right to payment regardless of whether or not your system meets the technical requirements.</p>\n<p>(4) To be able to use our products and services, you ultimately need an internet connection.\nWhen downloading and using our products and services, you may incur transmission costs from the internet access provider that you use.\nThe same applies to the use of our products and services and the associated additional services and content.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Privacy</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by us is found in our privacy policy.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Cancellation of Free Use</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) Each party may terminate the free use agreement at any time.\nTo do this, simply uninstall the program or the app that you use for our products and services.</p>\n<p>(2) Termination for an important reason remains reserved for each party.\nAn important reason is, in particular, if one party continues to breach material provisions of these GTCs despite warning.</p>\n<p>(3) Upon entry into effect of the cancellation, access will be blocked.</p>\n<p>(4) Each user has the right to terminate the use as a whole or, if technically possible, for individual functions at any time.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Amendment of the GTCs</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) We reserve the right to amend these GTCs at any time and without providing reasons.\nThe amended GTCs will be sent to the user in a suitable manner and, if applicable, by e-mail.</p>\n<p>(2) The new GTCs will be deemed agreed if the user does not object to them within 6 weeks after receipt of the notification.\nThe objection must be made in writing, e.g.\nby e-mail.\nThe options to object, the deadline and the consequences of his inaction will be indicated to the user separately in the notification.\nAlternatively, the amended GTCs could be presented to the user during the next time he signs in to our products and services.\nIn this case, the amended GTCs will be agreed with a consumer once the consumer agrees to them during the next time he signs in.\nThey are considered agreed with the consumer if the consumer does not object their validity within 6 weeks after first presentation.\nThe objection must be made in writing, e.g.\nby e-mail.\nWe will indicate the options to object, the deadline and the consequences of his inaction to the user separately in the presentation of the amended GTCs.</p>\n<p>(3) If the user objects to the validity of the new GTCs, both we and you have the right to cancel the contract.\nIt then ends immediately or upon expiry of the period agreed for the fee-based service.\nIn case of such a cancellation, you will receive a reimbursement of the fee paid corresponding to the duration.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Final Provisions</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) The GTCs including their interpretation are subject exclusively to the law of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nApplication of German and European conflict of laws principles and the UN Sales Convention is explicitly excluded.\nThis applies also to offers in other countries.</p>\n<p>(2) These GTCs are generally not set out in a separate contract text individually related to the user, which the user can then access later on.\nHowever, the content of the contract with the user arises from these GTCs and, if applicable, additional agreements reached at least in text form, e.g.\nspecifications and mutual other agreements of the contracting parties.</p>\n<p>(3) The contract can only be concluded in German.\nTranslations are a mere service without claim to the respective language being the contractual language.\nThe contract is concluded in German regardless of country and region.</p>\n<p>(4) If individual provisions of these GTCs including this provision are fully or partially invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions or parts of such provisions will remain unaffected.\nThe invalid or missing provision will be replaced by the corresponding statutory rules under German law.</p>\n<p>(5) Munich is the exclusive place of jurisdiction, unless there is a statutory exclusive place of jurisdiction according to German law, if you are a merchant, legal person under public law or a public special fund or you do not have general jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>\n<p>(6) You have no general jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Germany if you do not have any residence or permanent residence in the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Cancellation Policy</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Cancellation Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right of Cancellation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to cancel this contract within fourteen days without specifying the reasons.<br>\nThe cancellation period amounts to fourteen days from the date of contract conclusion.<br>\nTo exercise your right of

notification of cancelation before the expiry of the cancellation period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consequences of Cancellation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you cancel this contract, we have to refund to you all

Date: December 1, 2020</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I.\nIntroduction:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Ghostery Lite Browser Extension (\u201cGLBE\u201d) is owned by Cliqz International GmbH (\u201cCliqz\u201d), which is headquartered at Arabellastrasse 23, 81925 Munich, Germany, (\u201cCompany\u201d).\nThe Company, as the responsible body under the German Data Protection Law, takes the protection of your personal data very seriously and will always offer you the GLBE and its functionality with your privacy in mind.</p>\n<p>We also recognize that the GLBE is popular because people want to be informed and empowered.\nWe share the belief that privacy, when done right, is empowering, and that is why privacy is central to the GLBE and new functionality that we may add.\nTherefore, we only collect data to build our products for the benefit of our users and we believe that we as a company should never have any personal data (\u201cPersonal Data) about our users unless they affirmatively provide it to us.</p>\n<p>The core functionality of the GLBE is to inform users what third-party tracking technologies (\u201cTrackers\u201d) are tracking them on any given website so individuals can exercise personal control over that activity by blocking them for a cleaner, faster, safer browsing experience.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>II.\nBasis to Collect and Use Personal Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There is no obligation on your part to provide your Personal Data.\nHowever, if you do, we have a legitimate interest to collect and use it, namely so we can provide products or services, or complete a transaction with you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>III.\nNotion of Personal Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Personal Data means any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual such as name and age.\nNon-personal data are all data that cannot be used to identify an individual, such as statistics about usage of a website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IV.\nWhat Personal Data are collected</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>User Account:</strong> Currently we do not offer User Accounts, but might be doing so in the future.\nThen the GLBE User Account will \u2013 most certainly \u2013 have the ability to receive product information and also take advantage of new GLBE functionality.\nYou are not required to open a user account in order to use the GLBE.\nIf and when the functionality is added, you choose to open a user account by either downloading the GLBE, or any other time through the GLBE settings.\nIf you choose to create a user account, we will collect the following Personal Data: name, email address.\nAt any time you can deactivate your user account, at which time you will no longer have access to the services that a user account offers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IP-Address:</strong> We do not differentiate between static or dynamic IP addresses \u2013 that is driven at the user level \u2013 but please see the Security section below to learn more about the security measures we take to protect data \u2013 including your IP-address \u2013 that the GLBE collects.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>V.\nHow Personal Data are used</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The use of the GLBE Personal Data that we collect when you open an account is used for: (i) syncing your GLBE settings across browsers and devices, (ii) serving as your login credentials, and (iii) communicating directly to you through your email address in order to give you information about our products, services, updates and upgrades (in certain cases for a fee).</p>\n<p>IP-addresses are solely collected for geolocation purposes but only on Zip Code level or above (for example city, county, continent) to improve the GLBE.\nWe never store IP addresses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>VI.\nCollection of Non-Personal Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you download the GLBE, it collects on an ongoing basis the following data: web browser, operating systems, when an installation, upgrade, or uninstallation occurs, and whether the GLBE is active or engaged by you.</p>\n<p>The use of the aforementioned non-personal data is limited to: (i) communicating through the CMP (see VIII.) \u2013 since we don\u2019t have your name or email address \u2013 in order to share product information or updates and Company news, (ii) for internal analytical purposes such as accurately counting the number of browser extension downloads, or (iii) surveying our users from time to time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>VII.\nThe Consumer Messaging Platform (\u201cCMP\u201d)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The CMP is used from time to time as a way for us to effectively and generically communicate to our users, while still honoring their privacy.\nAt the moment, GLBE does not have this feature included, but will probably in the future.\nIf we add this feature in the future it will work, according to the CMP in the Ghostery Browser Extension:</p>\n<p>The CMP is automatically turned on, but you can easily turn it off by going to the GLBE options page and following the instructions provided.\nIf you turn off the CMP, you can still use the GLBE, but you won\u2019t receive any generic communications from us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>VIII.\nData Processing Abroad</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Although the Company is located in Germany, it partly operates out of the United States.\nThe data we collect, personal or otherwise, are located on servers based in the United States.\nIf you are accessing or using GLBE from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.\nlaw, please note that you may be allowing the collection or transferring of your personal data in or to the U.S.\nHowever, we have a strong data privacy framework in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IX.\nData Retention</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you deactivate your user account, the Company retains the collected Personal Data if and for as long as it may be required by law (for example to fulfil retention periods prescribed by law) or judicial order.\nThe Company will use this personal data only for those purposes and retains it only as long as prescribed by law.\nAfter that the Personal Data will be deleted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>X.\nData Portability &amp.\nErasure</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In compliance with the GDPR, Ghostery provides features available in the product menu that allow users to easily download and delete the Personal Data associated with their user accounts.&nbsp.\nIf users choose to download their information, it will be downloaded as a machine-readable CSV file and will include their name, email address, and Ghostery account settings and preferences.&nbsp.\nIf users choose to delete their account, all Personal Data associated with the account will be completely and permanently deleted from the Ghostery servers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>XI.\nSecurity</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Company has reasonable and appropriate technical, physical and administrative safeguards in place for a company of our size and complexity to protect the data that is collected.\nSome of the specific security measures we take include instantly hashing the origination IP addresses using very strong encryption technology to protect your privacy, whereupon the collected IP addresses and user agent information is destroyed.\nIn addition, to further preserve your security, the GLBE does not collect any information on URLs beyond the path query string.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>XII.\nContacting the Company </strong>\n</p>\n<p>At any time the user has the right to object any use of his personal data and can do so by writing to the Company at the physical address provided in the beginning of the document or by emailing the Company at <u>privacy@ghostery.com</u> If you object will be necessary to prove that you are the owner of the account.\nThe Company has the right to answer your inquiry electronically.\nPlease contact for this and all other inquiries, comments or concerns about these practices by email at <u>privacy@ghostery.com</u>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>XIII.\nChanges to Privacy Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may occasionally change this Privacy Policy and when we do, we will also revise the \u201cEffective Date\u201d at the top of the Privacy Policy.\nIf we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will try to inform you via the CMP and, if you opened an account and gave us your email address, then we will also try to contact you through the email address you provided about those material changes.\nUltimately, however, it is your responsibility to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about our data practices and any changes to them.\nYour continued use of the GLBE constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any changes to it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>__________</p>\n<p>Deutsche \u00dcbersetzung finden Sie hier.</p> Ghostery <ul>\n<li>About Ghostery</li>\n<li>Values</li>\n<li>Careers</li>\n<li>Press

2021</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong> Introduction</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Ghostery Plans and Products (\u201cGPP\u201d) are owned by Cliqz International GmbH (\u201cCliqz\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d), which is headquartered at Arabellastrasse 23, 81925 Munich, Germany.\nThe Company, as the responsible body under the German Data Protection Law, takes the protection of your personal data very seriously and will always offer you the GPP and its functionality with your privacy in mind.\nGhostery Plans and Products (GPP) are Cliqz\u2019s browser add-ons or extensions, downloadable software applications and tools, and any additional tools or services we provide in connection with our GPP.\nThis Ghostery Plans and Products Privacy Policy (Privacy Policy) tells you which data Cliqz collects, uses or has access to.</p>\n<p>We also recognize that the GPP are popular because people want to be informed and empowered.\nWe share the belief that privacy, when done right, is empowering, and that is why privacy is central to the GPP and new functionality that we may add.\nTherefore, we only collect data to build our products for the benefit of our users and we believe that we as a company should never have any personal data (\u201cPersonal Data) about our users unless they affirmatively provide it to us.</p>\n<p>The core functionality of the GPP is to inform users what third-party tracking technologies (\u201cTrackers\u201d) are tracking them on any given website or device application so individuals can exercise personal control over that activity by blocking them for a cleaner, faster, safer browsing experience and use of their own devices.</p>\n<strong>II.\nBasis to Collect and Use Personal Data</strong>\n<p>There is no obligation on your part to provide your Personal Data.\nHowever, if you do, we have a legitimate interest to collect and use it, namely so we can provide products or services, or complete a transaction with you acc.\nto Article 6 subsection 1 lit.\nb), f) GDPR.</p>\n<strong>III.\nNotion of Personal Data</strong>\n<p>Personal Data means any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual such as name and age.\nNon-personal data are all data that cannot be used to identify an individual, such as statistics about usage of a website.</p>\n<strong>IV.\nWhat Personal Data are collected</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>User Account:</strong>&nbsp;When you create a user account, we will collect the following Personal Data: name, email address, acc.\nto Article 6 subsection 1 lit.\nb), f) GDPR.</p>\n<p>Many GPP users had previously requested the ability to open accounts so they can receive product information and also take advantage of new functionality, certain Ghostery products, and higher tiers of service.\nYou are not required to open a user account in order to use GPP with the Basic plan service tier.\nIf you choose to open a user account in this case, you can do so either when you download any of our GPP, or any other time through relevant settings.\nAt any time, you can deactivate your user account, at which time you will no longer have access to the services that a user account offers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IP-Address:</strong> We do not differentiate between static or dynamic IP addresses \u2013 that is driven at the user level \u2013 but please see the Security section below to learn more about the security measures we take to protect data \u2013 including your IP-address \u2013 that the GPP collect.</p>\n<strong>V.\nHow Personal Data are used</strong>\n<p>The use of the GPP Personal Data that we collect when you open an account is used for: (i) syncing your GPP settings across browsers and devices acc.\nto Article 6 subsection 1 lit.\nf) GDPR, (ii) serving as your login credentials acc.\nto Article 6 subsection 1 lit.\nb) GDPR, and (iii) communicating directly to you through your email address in order to give you information about our products, services, updates and upgrades (in certain cases for a fee) acc.\nto Article 6 subsection 1 lit.\nb), f) GDPR.\nOur legitimate interest for the data collection acc.\nto Article 6 subsection 1 lit.\nf) GDPR are security measures (e.g.\nkeeping the GPP on an updated level) and communication with our users.</p>\n<p>IP-addresses are solely collected for geolocation purposes but only on Zip Code level or above (for example city, county, continent) to improve the GPP and our products.\nWe never store IP addresses.</p>\n<strong>VI.\nCollection of Non-Personal Data</strong>\n<p>When you download the Ghostery Browser Extension, Ghostery Insights, Ghostery Midnight, or Ghostery Dawn, or other GPP or Cliqz products, we collect on an ongoing basis the following data: web browser.\noperating systems.\nlanguage.\nGPP being used.\nopt-in settings to share Tracker information with the Company.\nwhen an installation, upgrade, or uninstallation occurs.\nwhether the extension or application is active, engaged, or logged-in by you (and associated frequency), and other product-specific telemetry for basic actions or settings.\nWe also collect pings regarding attribution of our own internal marketing efforts and basic Ghostery subscription information, such as what interval subscription is detected.</p>\n<p>The use of the aforementioned non-personal data is limited to: (i) communicating through the CMP (see VII.) \u2013 since we don\u2019t have your name or email address \u2013 in order to share product information or updates and Company news, (ii) for internal analytical purposes such as accurately counting the number of browser extension downloads, (iii) providing the services of the Ghostery Start Tab, which may include sharing of the non-personal data with other Cliqz products you have installed, locally on your device, or (iv) surveying our users from time to time.</p>\n<p>When using Ghostery Midnight, if errors occur within the Midnight application while in use, or if the application crashes or causes other applications to break or crash, non-personal data about the error(s) will be generated to help us identify the cause of the error so that we can fix it in a future update.\nThese error reports (\u201ccrash logs\u201d or \u201clogs\u201d) contain information such as the state of the application, operating system, and device at the time of the crash.\nother application names and data (depending on subscription plan).\ndata about websites visited while Midnight is active (depending on subscription plan).\nand error information.\nNo personal data is collected, and nothing in these logs can be used to personally identify the user.\nThese logs are collected and saved locally on the user\u2019s device, and, upon release of Midnight, are not automatically sent to Ghostery.\nIf Ghostery will start collecting these logs, we will ask for your permission before doing so.</p>\n<p>Ghostery Dawn also collects pings regarding browser settings, such as whether Dawn is set as the default browser, which search provider is set as the default search option, number of add-ons, and other non-personal data.</p>\n<strong>VII.\nThe Consumer Messaging Platform (\u201cCMP\u201d)</strong>\n<p>The CMP is used from time to time as a way for us to effectively and generically communicate to our users acc.\nto Article 6 subsection 1 lit.\nb), f) GDPR, while still honoring their privacy.\nThe CMP is automatically turned on, but you can easily turn it off by going to the Ghostery Browser Extension options page and following the instructions provided.\nIf you turn off the CMP, you can still use the GPP, but you won\u2019t receive any generic communications from us.</p>\n<strong>VIII.\nHuman Web</strong>\n<p>We developed a technology called Human Web, which is turned on by default in most browsers (but is turned off by default in the Firefox browser), and creates anonymous group models that power the private quick-search, anti-tracking and anti-phishing technologies featured in the Cliqz products and will be soon be featured in the GPP.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Collection:</strong>&nbsp;In order for Human Web to function we automatically collect non-private URLs, search queries along with search engine results pages, suspicious URLs that could potentially be phishing websites, information related to safe and unsafe trackers, and information related to the prevalence and performance of Trackers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Use:&nbsp;</strong>The data that we collect so Human Web can work is anonymized, aggregated and transmitted through the Human Web Proxy Network and used to improve the search, anti-tracking and anti-phishing features in Cliqz technology.</p>\n<p>For further information please go to&nbsp;https://cliqz.com/whycliqz/human-web.</p>\n<strong>IX.\nVirtual Private Network (\u201cVPN\u201d)</strong>\n<p>For the VPN technologies we provide, we use a trusted third-party provider.\nThis service is operated by FoxyProxy LLC.\nNote that FoxyProxy is legally obliged to NOT log any personal data \u2013 including explicit or implicit network identifiers.\nFoxyProxy\u2019s services cannot read message content (as it is encrypted).&nbsp.\nNo data is logged except bandwidth use.&nbsp.\nThat information is collected in order manage network performance.&nbsp.\nWe do not collect or store any IP address information.</p>\n<strong>X.\nGhostery Glow and Other Search Options in Ghostery Dawn</strong>\n<p>You can perform searches, using Ghostery Glow, directly from several places in Ghostery Dawn, including the URL Bar or on a new tab.\nGhostery does not receive your search queries<em>.</em> We do receive data about how you engage with search in the Ghostery Dawn and the number of searches you request from our search partners.\nQuery data is sent to your search provider acc.\nto Article 6 subsection 1 lit.\nb) GDPR, which has its own privacy policy.\nLinks to our default search providers are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Startpage</li>\n<li>Microsoft (Bing)</li>\n<li>Yahoo</li>\n<li>Google</li>\n<li>Tailcat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Search Suggestions: Ghostery Dawn by default sends search queries to your search provider to help you discover common phrases other people have searched for and improve your search experience.\nThese data will not be sent if your selected search provider does not support search suggestions.&nbsp.\nThis feature can be disabled via the \u201cSearch Suggestions\u201d section of the \u201cSearch\u201d tab in the browser Preferences)</p>\n<strong>XI.\nData Processing Abroad</strong>\n<p>Although the Company is located in Germany, it partly operates out of the United States.\nThe data we collect, personal or otherwise, are located on servers based in the United States.\nIf you are accessing or using GPP from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.\nlaw, please note that you may be allowing the collection or transferring of your personal data in or to the U.S.\nHowever, we have a strong data privacy framework in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for your Personal Data.</p>\n<strong>XII.\nData Retention</strong>\n<p>If you deactivate your user account, the Company retains the collected Personal Data if and for as long as it may be required by law (for example to fulfill retention periods prescribed by law) or judicial order.\nThe Company will use this Personal Data only for those purposes and retains it only as long as prescribed by law.\nAfter that the Personal Data will be deleted.</p>\n<strong>XIII.\nData Portability &amp.\nErasure</strong>\n<p>In compliance with the GDPR, the Company provides features available in the product menu that allow users to easily download and delete the Personal Data associated with their user accounts.&nbsp.\nIf users choose to download their information, it will be downloaded as a machine-readable CSV file and will include their name, email address, and your account settings and preferences.&nbsp.\nIf users choose to delete their account, all Personal Data associated with the account will be completely and permanently deleted from the Company servers.</p>\n<strong>XIV.\nSecurity</strong>\n<p>The Company has reasonable and appropriate technical, physical and administrative safeguards in place for a company of our size and complexity to protect the data that is collected.\nSome of the specific security measures we take include instantly hashing the origination IP addresses using very strong encryption technology to protect your privacy, whereupon the collected IP addresses and user agent information is destroyed.\nIn addition, to further preserve your security, the GPP do not collect any information on URLs beyond the path query string.</p>\n<p>Technical data for Ghostery Dawn updates and functionality improvements:&nbsp.\nDesktop versions of Ghostery Dawn check for browser updates and functionality improvements by persistently connecting to Ghostery servers, Mozilla servers, and Github servers.\nMozilla\u2019s privacy policy is linked here, and governs how Mozilla handles any personal data.\nGithub\u2019s privacy policy is linked here and governs how Github handles any personal data.\n&nbsp;Your Ghostery Dawn version, language, device operating system, and IP address are transmitted as the servers communicate in order to apply the correct updates acc.\nto Article 6 subsection 1 lit.\nb), f) GDPR as we described earlier.&nbsp.\nThis data is not logged or stored by Ghostery.</p>\n<p>Webpage and technical data to Certificate Authorities: When using Ghostery Dawn to visit a secure website (usually identified with a URL starting with \u201cHTTPS\u201d), Ghostery validates the website\u2019s certificate.\nThis may involve Ghostery sending certain information about the website to the Certificate Authority identified by that website.\nOpting out (via the \u201cCertificates\u201d section of the \u201cPrivacy and Security\u201d tab in the browser Preferences) increases the risk of your private information being intercepted.</p>\n<strong>XV.\nContacting the Company</strong>\n<p>At any time the user has the right to object any use of his personal data and can do so by writing to the Company at the physical address provided in the beginning of the document or by emailing the Company at privacy@ghostery.com If you object will be necessary to prove that you are the owner of the account.\nThe Company has the right to answer your inquiry electronically.\nPlease contact for this and all other inquiries, comments or concerns about these practices by email at privacy@ghostery.com.</p>\n<strong>XVI.\nChanges to Privacy Policy</strong>\n<p>We may occasionally change this Privacy Policy and when we do, we will also revise the \u201cEffective Date\u201d at the top of the Privacy Policy.\nIf we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will inform you via the CMP and, if you opened an account and gave us your email address, then we will also try to contact you through the email address you provided about those material changes.\nUltimately, however, it is your responsibility to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about our data practices and any changes to them.\nYour continued use of the GPP constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any changes to it.</p>\n<strong>XVII.\nPayments &amp.\nSubscriptions</strong>\n<p>We are offering paid subscriptions to use the GPP with a variety of features.\nThere are several subscriptions at different prices charged on a recurring monthly or yearly basis, depending your preference.</p>\n<p>We use the payment services provider (PSP) Stripe.\nIf you pay our subscription fees through this service, it is necessary that you enter some personal data (name, address, contact data, GPP login data, financial information).\nStripe acts as a data controller and not on our behalf as a processor.\nWe pull some of this information into our product so you can more easily review your subscription, but we do this using the Stripe API and we do not store any of this information ourselves.\nFor further information see Stripes privacy policy:&nbsp;https://stripe.com/de/privacy.</p>\n<p>To calculate the appropriate regional VAT/GST/sales tax for each payment, we use the service Avalara.\nTo calculate the applying taxes Avalara needs some personal data (country, postal code).\nThis is the only information Avalara receives.\nBased on the postal code, Avalara determines how much tax should be charged and recorded via Stripe.</p>\n<p>Stripe will use the Avalara API to calculate a regional VAT/GST/sales tax based on the users\u2019 postal code and then returns the amount of tax that needs to be accounted for on that transaction.\nStripe will charge the appropriate amount, tax included, and Avalara will record the amount of tax collected and in which region so that we can report those taxes to the regional governing body.\nFor further information see the privacy policy of Avalara:&nbsp;https://www.avalara.com/us/en/legal/privacy-policy.html.</p>\n<strong>XVIII.\nCalifornia</strong>\n<p>For residents of California, please see our&nbsp;Privacy Policy Supplemental Notice

activity records (log files) stored on our web servers or by collecting data from end devices via pixels, cookies or similar tracking technologies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Processing:</strong>&nbsp;Any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pixel:</strong>&nbsp;Pixels are also called tracking pixels, web beacons or web bugs.\nThese are small, invisible graphics in HTML emails or on websites.\nWhen a document is opened, this small image is downloaded from a server on the Internet and the download is registered there.\nThis allows the operator of the server to see if and when an email has been opened or a website has been visited.\nThis function is usually carried out by calling up a small program (JavaScript).\nCertain types of information can be detected on your computer system in this way and shared, such as the content of cookies, the time and date of the visit, and a description of the page on which the tracking pixel is located.</p>\n2.\nScope of validity\n<p>This data privacy

personal data in the context of our services.\nThe information is subdivided for greater clarity into certain functions in connection with our services.\nIn case of the normal use of the services, different functions and therefore also different processing operations can be implemented consecutively or simultaneously.</strong>\n</p>\n1.\nGeneral information about the data processing operations\n<p>The following applies to all the processing operations listed below, unless stated otherwise:</p>\na.\nNo obligation to provide personal data &amp.\nconsequences of failure to provide such data\n<p>The provision of personal data is not required by law or contract, and you are under no obligation to provide any data.\nWe will inform you during the data entry process when personal information needs to be provided for the relevant service (e.g., by indicating \u201cmandatory fields\u201d).\nIn cases where the provision of data is required, the consequence of not providing data will be that the service in question cannot be provided.\nOtherwise, failure to provide data may result in our inability to provide our services in the same form and quality.</p>\nb.\nConsent\n<p>In various cases, you may also grant us your consent to the further processing of data (or some of the data, where applicable) in connection with the operations listed below.\nIn this case, we will inform you separately in connection with the submission of the respective declaration of consent about all the procedures and the scope of the consent and about the purposes which we pursue in these processing operations.\nThe processing operations based on your consent are therefore not listed again here (Art.\n13, subs.\n4, GDPR).</p>\nc.\nTransfer of personal data to third countries\n<p>Ghostery is a corporation of the United States, which is considered a \u201cthird country\u201d by the GDPR, i.e., a country outside the European Union.\nThe data transmitted to and within the United States and other third countries are transmitted strictly in compliance with the statutory conditions of admissibility.\nIf the transmission of the data to a third country does not serve the purpose of fulfilling our contract with you, if we do not have your consent, if the transmission is not required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and if no other exemption applies under Art.\n49 GDPR, we will only transmit your data to a third country if in possession of an adequacy decision pursuant to Art.\n45 GDPR or appropriate safeguards under Art.\n46 GDPR.<br>\nOne of these adequacy decisions is the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12.07.2016 on the \u201cEU-US Privacy Shield\u201d for the USA.\nThe level of data protection is generally considered to be appropriate according to Art.\n45 GDPR for transfers to companies which are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.\nAlternatively or additionally, safeguards under Art.\n46 subs.\n2 c) GDPR through the conclusion of the EU standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with the receiving body provide appropriate safeguards and an adequate level of data protection.\nCopies of the standard EU data protection clauses are available on the website of the European Commission at&nbsp;https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en.</p>\nd.\nHosting at external service providers\n<p>Our data processing work is carried out to a large extent with the involvement of hosting service providers who provide us with storage space and processing capacities at their data centers and who also process personal data on our behalf according to our instructions.\nIt may be the case that personal data are transmitted to hosting service providers in respect of all of the functions listed below.\nThese service providers process data either exclusively in the EU or subject to guaranteed levels of data protection which we have put in place based on the standard EU data protection clauses (cf.\nsubsection c.).</p>\ne.\nTransmission to government authorities\n<p>We send personal information to government authorities (including law enforcement agencies) when required to fulfil a legal obligation to which we are subject (legal basis: Art.\n6, subs.\n1 c), GDPR) or when it is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims (legal basis: Art.\n6, subs.\n1 f), GDPR).</p>\nf.\nPeriod of storage\n<p>The time specified in the \u201cperiod of storage\u201d paragraph indicates how long we use the data for the purposes in any given case.\nAt the end of this period, the data will no longer be processed by us but will be deleted at regular intervals, unless continued processing and storage are required by law (in particular, because it is necessary to fulfil a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims) or unless you grant us extended consent.</p>\ng.\nData categories\n<p>The category names listed below are used for specific types of data in the following sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Account data:&nbsp;</strong>Login/user ID and password</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal master
