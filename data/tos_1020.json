available only through creation of a subscription account and payment of a fee (\"Subscription Services\").\nThrough such Subscription Services accounts, you will have access to the Subscription Services for a fixed term, which may renew automatically as described in these Terms.\nPlease note that for Canadian users who subscribe to NHL LIVE\u2122 or NHL.TV through NHL LIVE\u2122 Media, Inc.\n(\"NHL LIVE\u2122\"), the billing and payment terms in the applicable NHL LIVE\u2122 Terms of Service will apply for these Canadian users and not the billing and payment policies of the NHL in connection with this service.\nFor all non-Canadian users who subscribe to NHL.TV, the billing and payment policies of NHL will apply.</li>\n<li>Access Restrictions.\nYou are not authorized to access any Subscription Services unless you (i) have opened a subscription account with the NHL (or, in Canada, with NHL LIVE\u2122), and paid the appropriate fee.\n(ii) have received access credentials (including a username and password), and (iii) are using those access credentials.\nYou may not assist anyone else in accessing Subscription Services on an unauthorized basis, including by sharing, selling, publicly offering, or offering to sell your access credentials or providing any content or other materials that you obtained through Subscription Services to third parties or otherwise in violation of these Terms.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access credentials and if you know or suspect that anyone other than you knows your access credentials, you must promptly notify us.\nYou are also responsible for all usage or activity on your Subscription Services accounts, including the use of Subscription Services by any third party authorized by you to use your access credentials.\nSuch responsibility expressly includes any purchases made or other charges incurred on your credit or debit card in connection with your use (or an authorized third party's use) of the Subscription Services.\nIn the event of any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity on your Subscription Services accounts, we may, in our sole discretion, terminate those accounts and refer you to appropriate law enforcement agencies.\nYou may be responsible for damages from any such fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity.</li>\n<li>Devices and Minimum System Requirements.\nSome Subscription Services, such as NHL.TV and other video services, are accessible only using certain devices that meet certain minimum system requirements.\nYou should investigate Subscription Services before you pay for access to them to ensure that they will be compatible with your device, because we will not refund any fees you paid if the Subscription Services to which you subscribe are not compatible.\nFor some devices, the payment for Subscription Services may be processed by the device provider.\nThose payments will be governed by the device provider's terms, including its cancellation and refund policy.\nOther restrictions, including restrictions on the availability of the devices or the Subscription Services in certain countries, may apply.\nClick here for more information on devices:&nbsp;https://www.nhl.com/subscribe#devices</li>\n<li>Suspension or Termination.\nWe may suspend or terminate your access to Subscription Services at any time without notice to you.\nIf we do so, you will not be responsible for fees associated with the Subscription Services after the termination becomes effective, but you will not have any other remedies against us, and we will not issue any refunds.\nIf you have breached or violated any obligation under these Terms, you will not be entitled to any remedy.</li>\n<li>Billing and Payment.\n<p>Please note that this subsection does not apply to Canadian users who subscribe to NHL.TV or NHL LIVE\u2122.\nThese users will be subject to NHL LIVE\u2122' billing and payment policies.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age and Billing Authorization.By subscribing to a Subscription Service, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age, that all information you submit is true and correct (including all credit or debit card information), and that you are the authorized holder of the credit or debit card.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Fees.You agree to pay all subscription fees and other charges to your Subscription Services accounts, including any applicable taxes (including any applicable VAT tax).\nThe NHL (or, where applicable, your device provider) reserves the right to change the amount of, or the basis for determining, any subscription fees or other charges for the Subscription Services and to institute new subscription fees or other charges effective upon prior notice to you.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Sales Tax.\nFor certain purchases made via the Services, NHL is required to collect sales tax (including any applicable VAT tax).\nIn states or regions that impose sales or use tax, a purchase is subject to tax unless specifically exempt.\nPurchases from the Services are not exempt from sales or use taxes simply because they are made from the Internet or because NHL is not required to collect sales or use tax by any particular state or region.\nWhether any sales tax will be collected on a given purchase and the amount of tax charged depends on a number of factors including but not limited to whether the seller is present in a given jurisdiction.\nThe purchaser is responsible for any applicable taxes not collected by NHL and certain states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return reporting taxable purchases for which tax was not collected by NHL and to pay such tax.\nFor details, see the website of, or otherwise contact, the applicable taxing authority.\nIf any sales tax will be collected by NHL in connection with a purchase, that amount will be shown either prior to the completion of any purchase or reflected in the final confirmation of that purchase.\n<p>For Oklahoma purchasers, applicable use tax on purchases made via the Services may be reported and paid on an Oklahoma individual income tax return, currently Form 511 or by filing a consumer use tax return, currently Form 21-1.\nThe referenced forms and corresponding instructions are available on the Oklahoma Tax Commission website.</p>\n<p>For South Dakota purchasers, any applicable sales or use taxes on purchases made via the Services may be reported and paid on a South Dakota Use Tax Form, currently Form 1350, available with corresponding instructions on the South Dakota Department of Revenue website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Automatic Renewal <ul>\n<li>Monthly Subscription Services.\nFor Subscription Services billed on a monthly basis, your subscription will automatically renew monthly during the current NHL season through and including June and annually prior to the start of the subsequent NHL season at the then-current NHL season's regular full monthly price, unless you cancel your Subscription Service prior to the beginning of the next applicable billing (and renewal) period.\nThe primary credit or debit card you have stored in the Payment Profile section of your NHL.TV account will be charged on or about the same date each month of your subscription during any NHL season and each subsequent year as set forth above.\nIf we are unable to process these charges to your primary credit or debit card, an alternative card stored in the Payment Profile section of your NHL.TV account may be charged.\nIf you wish to cancel a Subscription Service, you have two options: (i) you may cancel your monthly subscription in its entirety (including the annual automatic renewal of the Subscription Service in subsequent years) or (ii) you may cancel your monthly subscription for the applicable NHL season, but elect to annually automatically renew (i.e., re-start) your monthly subscription in the following NHL season.\nTo elect either of these options and cancel a Subscription Service, you may login to your NHL.TV account, access the My Account section and follow the applicable instructions, or send an email to customersupport@web.nhl.com.\nIn no event will NHL provide partial or pro-rated refunds.\nPlease see the Cancellation Section below for details regarding refunds.</li>\n<li>Yearly Subscription Services.\nFor Subscription Services billed on a yearly basis, your subscription will automatically renew annually prior to the start of the NHL season each year at the then-current year's regular full yearly price, unless you cancel your Subscription Service prior to the beginning of the next applicable billing (and renewal) period.\nThe primary credit or debit card you have stored in the Payment Profile section of your NHL.TV account will be charged each subsequent year as set forth above.\nIf we are unable to process these charges to your primary credit or debit card, an alternative card stored in the Payment Profile section of your NHL.TV account may be charged.\nTo cancel your yearly Service, login to your NHL.TV account, access the My Account section and follow the applicable instructions, or send an email to customersupport@web.nhl.com.\nIn no event will NHL provide partial or pro-rated refunds.\nPlease see the Cancellation Section below for details regarding refunds.\n<p>UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT APPLICABLE BILLING (AND RENEWAL) PERIOD THAT YOU WISH TO CANCEL ANY AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU) TO COLLECT THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY TAXES (INCLUDING APPLICABLE VAT TAXES) USING ANY CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD STORED IN THE PAYMENT PROFILE SECTION OF YOUR NHL.TV ACCOUNT.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Trial Subscriptions.\nAccess to a Subscription Service, including NHL.TV, may from time to time be made available on a time-limited free trial basis (a \"Trial Subscription\").\nPlease note that these Terms apply to a Trial Subscription.\nYou may be asked to provide your credit or debit card information when registering for a Trial Subscription.\nIn such event, your credit or debit card will only be charged if you do not cancel your Trial Subscription before the end of the Trial Subscription period.\nIf we ask for your credit or debit card information and you do not affirmatively cancel before the end of the Trial Subscription, then your Trial Subscription may be converted into a paid subscription and your credit or debit card may be charged the subscription fee in effect at the time your Trial Subscription first began.\nBy subscribing for a Trial Subscription, you: (i) acknowledge that the Trial Subscription is personal to you and may not be transferred or otherwise assigned to any other person.\n(ii) acknowledge that the Trial Subscription is intended to permit you to assess the Subscription Services for consideration of a full subscription to the Pay Service (a \"Paid Subscription\").\nand (iii) acknowledge that the Trial Subscription may be subject to other terms and conditions specific to the Trial Subscription being offered, and your use of the Subscription Service during the Trial Subscription period will also be subject to such other terms and conditions and such other terms and conditions shall be incorporated into the Terms.\nand (iv) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IF YOU ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE YOUR CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD INFORMATION AND THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION IS NOT CANCELLED WITHIN THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOUR TRIAL SUBCRIPTION WILL CONVERT TO A PAID SUBSCRIPTION THE PRICE OF WHICH WILL BE EQUAL TO THE PRICE OF A PAID SUBSCRIPTION IN EFFECT AT THE TIME THE TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION BEGAN AND THE CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD YOU PROVIDED WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE BILLED BASED ON A PAID SUBSCRIPTION AS IF SUCH PAID SUBSCRIPTION BEGAN ON DAY ONE OF YOUR TRIAL SUBSCRIPTION.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Cancellation.\nTo cancel your subscription to Subscription Services, you must follow the procedures described below.\nIf we do not list cancellation procedures for a particular Subscription Service, you should contact us at NHL.com/contact.\nExcept as described below, we do not refund or prorate Subscription Services, or any other purchases made through the Services, for any reason.\nRequests to terminate subscriptions will be effective once the billing period in which we received the cancellation concludes.\n<ul>\n<li>NHL.TV.\nSubject to applicable laws, if you are a subscriber to NHL.TV, you may cancel your subscription within five (5) days of initially subscribing or within five (5) days after your subscription has automatically renewed, and receive a refund of the subscription price.\nprovided that if you sign up for NHL.TV again after canceling, the NHL reserves the right to deny further cancellation requests made within a single NHL season.\nYou may cancel your subscription by contacting customer support at 800-559-2333 in the United States and 1-412-386-2646 internationally, between the hours of 12pm EST until the later of (i) 12am, or (ii) time of last puck drop during the NHL season and
