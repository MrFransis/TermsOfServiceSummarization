so-called fan page on the social media platform of Facebook.\nFacebook and Vinted are only jointly responsible for the processing of so-called \"insights data\" (Art.\n26 (1) sentence 1 of the GDPR) insofar as this data is used for the creation of so-called \"page insights\" and only for the phases of the collection of data from Vinted's fan page until the transmission to Facebook.\nFor other data processing, Vinted and Facebook are separately responsible for data processing.</p>\n<p>Within the scope of their joint controllership, Vinted and Facebook have entered into an agreement (so-called \"page insights controller addendum\").\nThe agreement covers the data processing that is collected and used in connection with a visit or interaction with our fan page, but only to the extent that this data is also (subsequently) processed for \"page insights\".\n\"Page insights\" includes analysis services that help us to better understand interactions on our site.\nIn this context, we do not receive any personal data from Facebook, but only an anonymous evaluation and illustration.\nFacebook provides more information on this on&nbsp;its help page for \"page insights\".\nThe&nbsp;information about data for \"page insights\"&nbsp;explains how \"insights data\" is collected and used to create \"page insights\".\nThis includes the following actions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Views and interactions with a page, post, video, story, or other content associated with a page;</li>\n<li>Subscribing or unsubscribing to a page;</li>\n<li>Reactions to a page

name or profile picture of a page to see a preview of the page contents;</li>\n<li>Clicks on the website, phone number, \"route planning\" button or any other button on a page;</li>\n<li>Views of an event of a page, reactions to an event (including the type of reaction), clicks on a link for event tickets;</li>\n<li>Starting a messenger conversation with the page;</li>\n<li>Views or clicks on articles in a website shop;</li>\n<li>IP address as well as other information that is available on your end device in the form of cookies.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The processing of the data of the visitors of our fan page serves the purpose of providing the page as well as the statistical evaluation of the use of our page.\nThis evaluation is made anonymous for Vinted.\nThe legal basis for data processing is Art.\n6 (1)(f) of the GDPR.\nOur legitimate interests in the processing of personal data when visiting the site and the creation of the \"site insights\" consist of presenting the company and the Platform and, for example, contacting members and interested parties and providing information about products and promotions, as well as the collection of data for the creation of anonymous evaluations and illustrations about the use of our fan page.</p>\n<p>If you wish to exercise your rights regarding your data (see bullet point 6.\nbelow), it would certainly be more effective for you to contact Facebook directly.\nIf you still need help in exercising your rights, you can contact us.\nIn accordance with our agreement, Facebook assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the obligations for the joint processing of \"insights data\".\nThis includes fulfilling the following rights:</p>\n<p>- The right to access (Art.\n15 of the GDPR);</p>\n<p>- The right to ratification (Art.\n17 of the GDPR);</p>\n<p>- The right to restrict processing (Art.\n18 of the GDPR);</p>\n<p>- The right to data portability (Art.\n20 of the GDPR).\nand</p>\n<p>- The right of objection

remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect.&nbsp.\nNo waiver of any provision of this Section of the Terms will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement.&nbsp.\nSuch a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms.&nbsp.\nThis Section of the Terms will survive the termination of your
