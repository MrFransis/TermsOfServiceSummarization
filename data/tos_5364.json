MAY COLLECT <p>Personal Data is generally defined as information that, alone or in combination with other information, could identify, relate to, describe, reference, or reasonably could be associated with a particular individual, directly or indirectly.\nTo provide some examples, depending on where you live, categories of Personal Data other businesses collect can include, but are not limited to,

Client\u2019s contact details when a Client enters a contractual relationship with Hindsight and we will collect a password or other account access credentials when a Client creates a Hindsight account.\nWhen a Client sends us an email asking a question we will collect the information, including any Personal Data, that the Client provides in the email.\nWe will also collect any Personal Data and other information that Clients choose to provide to us, such as any information contained in a message or form that a Client submits through our Site or via email.\nWe may also collect Personal

name, business email address, and/or information associated with your Internet protocol (IP) address such as your browser, device, and location information to the extent such information is reasonably capable of identifying or being associated with you.</p> 2.2 User Information <p>When Users interact with Hindsight Services that appear on our Clients\u2019 websites and other third-party properties online, Hindsight may automatically collect certain information based on the IP address associated with the User\u2019s computer, device, or browser.\nSuch User information generally is not capable of

websites, the link that led a User to a Client\u2019s website, the dates and times a User accesses a Client\u2019s website, event information (e.g., system crashes), general location information (e.g., city and state), hashed email addresses (when made available by the User), and gender (when made available by the User).\nTo whatever extent such automatically collected User information is reasonably capable of identifying you or being associated with you, we will refer to it as device information and treat it as Personal Data.\nHindsight requests that Clients obtain any necessary consent on our behalf where required to do so by applicable data protection laws and regulations, in order for Hindsight to collect this User Information.</p> 3.\nHOW HINDSIGHT GATHERS INFORMATION

Clients\u2019 websites and other online properties and interact with our Services, such as device information that may be Personal Data to the extent it is reasonably capable of identifying you.\nFor example, when you access or use the Services, we and third parties that may provide certain functionality on or through the Services may engage, receive, collect, and store certain device information

IP address, browser type, the date and time that you use the Services, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, unique identifiers related to your browser, and information about your

tools.\nHowever, if you disable them, the Services may not work properly.</p> 4.\nHOW AND WHY HINDSIGHT USES YOUR INFORMATION <p>Hindsight only uses your Personal Data when we have a proper reason for

to law enforcement entities, government entities, or other persons unless permitted or required to do so by the following: (1) any lawful method or process by which a law enforcement entity is permitted to obtain such information.\n(2) a court order with sufficient notice to both Hindsight and the user so that either can contest disclosure.\n(3) the user has given informed, affirmative consent in writing to the specific disclosure to the specific person for a particular purpose.\n(4) Hindsight\u2019s reasonable good faith belief that the Personal Data collected through the Services

when the law enforcement entity requesting disclosure has applied for and received approval for a valid search warrant.\nUpon the written request of a law enforcement entity to preserve a Client\u2019s or User\u2019s Personal Data, pending receipt of a request or demand for such Personal Data pursuant to the conditions listed above, Hindsight will retain the relevant records and evidence for ninety (90) days from the date of the preservation request by the law enforcement entity, renewable for another 90-day period following a renewed written request by the law enforcement entity.</p>\n<p>If you are a User, when you interact with our Services on our Clients\u2019 websites and other third-party properties, we may provide advertisements to you based on your recent browsing behavior across different Client websites, browsers, or devices.\nFor example, if you are viewing an article about a movie on one of our publisher Client\u2019s sites, you may see an advertisement we provide that will feature information about tickets to movies in your area and include links to other articles or content about movies on the publisher\u2019s site.</p>\n<p>We adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles set forth by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and the Interactive Advertising Bureau\u2019s (IAB) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral

us at management@hindsightsolutions.net.\nIf you are a Client or work on behalf of a Client, you may submit a data subject access request to the same email address and identify your relationship to the applicable Client so that Hindsight may either respond with the relevant information or, if applicable, direct this request to, and cooperate with, your employer to respond.</p>\n<p>Under applicable data privacy and protection laws and regulations, Clients and Users located in the EU may have the right to lodge a complaint about Hindsight\u2019s processing of your Personal Data with a supervisory authority.\nIn particular, such individuals may lodge a complaint in the Member State where the individual lives or works or where the alleged violation took place.</p>\n<p>If you reside within the EU, we will seek your consent before using your Personal Data to serve you relevant content and materials based on your personal preferences, interests, location and other information that you provide to Hindsight in connection with your use of the Services.</p>\n<p>If you are located in the EU, we may need to share your Personal Data with third parties in other countries to provide our

legal exceptions), you can do so by emailing us at management@hindsightsolutons.net or by calling us at 908 821 6865.</p>\n<p>Any removal of content by Hindsight does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal in all places.\nThe content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal, state or other applicable law may require maintenance of the content or information.\nHindsight will do its best to accommodate your request, but we cannot guarantee we can remove all Personal Data from the specified uses.\nTherefore, please be as specific as possible in your request.\nIf the request relates to information that Hindsight needs to make certain Services function properly for you, you may not be able to use those Services properly moving forward.</p>\n<p>Hindsight reserves the right to maintain proper business records as required by law, or for otherwise legitimate business purposes to the extent permitted by law, even if such records contain your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>Hindsight is required to verify the identity of any person or entity that requests the disclosure or deletion of Personal Data.\nIf you have a password-protected account with us, we will use our existing authentication procedures to verify your identity.\nFor most other requests, Hindsight will ask you to provide information that matches at least two pieces of Personal Data we store about you before responding to your request.</p>\n<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Data relates to you.\nMaking a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\nWe will only use Personal Data provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor\u2019s identity or authority to make the request.</p>\n<p>If you would like to opt-out of receiving promotional emails from Hindsight, please follow the opt-out instructions at the bottom of the email or send Hindsight a detailed email at management@hindsightsolutons.net.</p>\n<p>Some browsers have a \u201ddo not track\u201d feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked.\nHindsight does not currently have the capability to process these kinds of technical requests.\nTo learn about ways to opt-out of certain kinds of tracking for targeted advertising purposes, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative website and the Digital Advertising Alliance website.\nOptions you select are browser- and device-specific, and there is no guarantee these industry-provided opt-out tools will prevent all targeted advertising.</p> 10.\nSECURING PERSONAL DATA <p>Hindsight implements, uses, and maintains industry standard technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help secure your non-public Personal Data from loss, unauthorized access or disclosure, both in storage and in transmission.\nHindsight protects any Personal Data or other information it collects from you using various technologies and safeguards, including Secure Socket Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d), which is an encrypted communication protocol, and Transport Layer Security, the successor protocol to SSL.\nSSL and TLS are standard formats for transmitting secure data from your computer to Hindsight\u2019s servers.\nSSL and TLS work by using a private key to encrypt data that is transferred over the SSL and TLS connection.</p>\n<p>While Hindsight takes the issue of protecting your Personal Data seriously, you should exercise discretion in what information you disclose and/or transmit through the Services.\nHindsight cannot guarantee that information sent over the Internet is fully secure.\nThe transmitted information may be intercepted by others before it reaches Hindsight.\nIf you are concerned about sending information to Hindsight over the Internet, please send the information by mail or call us to make other arrangements.\nHindsight is not responsible for the security of information transmitted online.</p> 11.\nCHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY <p>The Services are

interact with any of the Services or their features.\nWe do not and will not knowingly collect any information, including Personal Data, from any person under 16 years of age and Hindsight will take immediate steps to delete any such information if it is inadvertently received.\nIf Hindsight learns that we have received Personal Data from any person under 16 years of age, Hindsight will delete that information.\nIf you believe a person under 16 years of age used our Services without authorization in a way that Hindsight somehow received a persistent identifier such as a static IP address that is capable of identifying the person under 16, or any other information that could be considered Personal Data under applicable law, please contact us immediately at management@hindsightsolutons.net.\nAgain, any deletion by Hindsight does not ensure or guarantee complete or comprehensive removal of the information in all places.\nThe content may have been shared or reposted by other parties, or federal or state law may require maintenance of the content or information.</p> 12.\nCALIFORNIA RESIDENTS <p>Applicable California privacy legislation permits visitors
