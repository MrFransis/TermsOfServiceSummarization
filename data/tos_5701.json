is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.2.\nNo Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You and Flatiron Media agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and Flatiron Media and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.\nYou and Flatiron Media agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.\nFurther, you and Flatiron Media agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.3.\nFederal Arbitration Act</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You and Flatiron Media agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 14 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq.\n(the \"FAA\"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.4.\nNotice.\nInformal Dispute Resolution</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You and Flatiron Media agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in

include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used for your Flatiron Media account and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking.\nIf you and Flatiron Media cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Flatiron Media may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 14, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 14.1, file a claim in court.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.5.\nProcess</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Except for Disputes arising out of or related to a

you or Flatiron Media within one (1) year of the date the Dispute arose, otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred (which means that you and Flatiron Media will no longer have the right to assert such claim regarding the Dispute).\nYou and Flatiron Media agree that (a) any arbitration will occur in the State of New York, County of New York, Borough of Manhattan or via video conference, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (\"JAMS\"), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of New York, County of New York, Borough of Manhattan, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.\nYou may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your current residence if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.6.\nAuthority of Arbitrator</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nprovided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.\nThe arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.7.\nRules of JAMS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website.\nBy agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.8.\nSeverability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If any term, clause or provision of this Section 14 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 14 will remain valid and enforceable.\nFurther, the waivers set forth in Section 14.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.</p> 15.\nGOVERNING LAW AND VENUE <p>These Terms and your access to and use of the Services shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.\nAny dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of New York and the United States, respectively, sitting in New York County, New York.</p> 16.\nTERMINATION <p>We may suspend or terminate your ability to access and use all or part of the Services at any time and for any reason or no reason without notifying you first.\nFlatiron Media is not responsible for any harm related to your inability to access or use the Services.</p> 17.\nSEVERABILITY <p>If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.</p> 18.\nMISCELLANEOUS TERMS <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Flatiron Media and you and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements of the parties relating to your access to and use of the Services.\nThese Terms, and any rights and license granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Flatiron Media.\nFlatiron Media\u2019s failure to assert any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver or relinquishment of such provision or right.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.</p> 19.\nMOBILE POLICY <p>Consumers will only receive EverydayWinner text notifications after they request to be informed via text about additional chances to win the sweepstakes.</p>\n<p>Up
