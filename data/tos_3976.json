Rights Under CCPA<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Right to Know.</b> You have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell.\nTo make a request, contact Edison via email at mailsupport@edison.tech.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Deletion Rights.</b> You have the right to request deletion of your personal information.\nSee the section above titled \u201cYour Choices to Manage Information\u201d for options and processes for deleting your personal information.\nDeletion requests require a two-step process, first by making the request, then a second confirmation either via a response from your email account or a second confirmation inside the Services.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Verification.</b> Edison verifies requests made via email by first sending a confirmation email to the account connected with the Services, verification is completed when you reply to that email confirming the request.\nIf a request is made on your device from within the Services, then the request for data is confirmed via a pop-up in the Services.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Response Time.</b> Edison responds promptly to all requests, but will confirm receipt of requests within 10 days, and respond within 45

Information<p>Edison sells Commercial Data that is deidentified information to its Edison Trends subscribers.\nThis is not the same as selling personal information and it is important that you understand the difference.</p>\n<p>Under the CCPA, personal information does not include deidentified information (Cal Civ Code \u00a7 1798.140(0)(3))</p>\n<p>To be deidentified, information \u201ccannot reasonably identify, relate to, describe, be capable of being associated with, or be linked, directly or indirectly, to a particular consumer\u201d (Cal Civ Code \u00a7 1798.140 (h)).</p>Further, to use deidentified data, Edison is required to:<ol>\n<li>Have implemented technical safeguards that prohibit reidentification of the consumer to whom the information may pertain.</li>\n<li>Have implemented business processes that specifically prohibit reidentification of the information.</li>\n<li>Have implemented business processes to prevent inadvertent release of deidentified information.</li>\n<li>Make no attempt to reidentify the information.\n(Cal Civ Code \u00a7 1798.140 (h))</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Edison meets or exceeds these deidentification requirements.\nAs a technical safeguard, we deidentify Commercial Messages to create Commercial Data by obfuscating usernames and email addresses, reducing the fidelity of physical addresses, and the use of filters and algorithms to identify personal information and remove it from the Commercial Data we provide to our subscribers, making reidentification unreasonable.\nEdison\u2019s business processes prohibit reidentification of personal information in the Commercial Data sold to our subscribers and include security controls to safeguard against breaches of both personal information and the deidentified information in Commercial Data.\nEdison does not attempt to reidentify personal information contained in the Commercial Data sold to our subscribers, nor allows our subscribers to.</p>Contact For More
