your data for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Identification and authentication:</strong>&nbsp;We use your data to verify you when you access your account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Operating our services:</strong>&nbsp;We use your data to provide our services, process and fulfill orders, provide customer support, and to otherwise comply with our contractual obligations to you.\nWe (and/or our third-party vendors) use your financial information to process purchases made by you and to pay you amounts you have earned.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communicating with you:</strong>&nbsp;We use your data when we communicate with you (e.g., when we respond to a customer support or other inquiry).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improving our services:</strong>&nbsp;We use your data to understand how our services are being used and how we can improve them.\nIn general, we analyze aggregated data, rather than specific user data.\nWe may, however, need to analyze a specific case to address a specific problem (e.g., a bug that affects only a few accounts).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customizing your experience:</strong>&nbsp;We use your data to personalize the service to you.\nThis may include remembering your preferences for language or volume or displaying videos that you might enjoy, based upon your viewing choices.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Marketing and advertising:</strong>&nbsp;We use your data to show you ads on third-party sites.\nWe may also use your data in delivering third-party advertisements to you.\nThis may include \"targeted ads\" based upon your activities.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Exercising our rights:</strong>&nbsp;Where reasonably necessary, we use your data to exercise our legal rights and prevent abuse of our service.\nFor example, we may use your data to detect and prevent fraud, spam, or content that violates our Terms of Service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal compliance:</strong>&nbsp;We use your data where we are legally required to do so.\nFor example, we may need to gather your data to respond to a subpoena or court order.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Protecting your information:</strong>&nbsp;Where appropriate, we may anonymize, backup, and delete certain data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may use algorithms and other automated means to implement any of the above.</p>\n<p>Whenever we process your data for one of these purposes, we have determined that one or more of the following lawful bases apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Performance of a contract;</li>\n<li>Legitimate commercial interest;</li>\n<li>Compliance with a legal obligation.\nor</li>\n<li>Consent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you require further information about the balancing test that Vimeo has undertaken to justify its reliance on legitimate interest as a lawful basis of processing, see&nbsp;<strong>Section 15</strong>&nbsp;for information on how to contact us.</p>5.\nWith Whom We

transaction as discussed in Section 6.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Aggregated or anonymized information:</strong> We may publicly disclose non-personal aggregated or anonymized information such as our number of visitors and registered users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use reasonable efforts to vet vendors for their privacy and data security practices.\nWe require that such vendors agree to protect the data we share.</p>\n<strong>Enterprise-Administered Accounts</strong>\n<p>Where the services are provided to you through your employer or another organization that administers access,&nbsp;that organization may be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access information about your account activity;</li>\n<li>Delete or limit access to your account or its content.\nand/or</li>\n<li>Change the email address associated

Disclosures<p>We may disclose your data in response to official requests (e.g., court orders, subpoenas, search warrants, national security requests, etc.) (\"requests\") that we receive from government authorities or parties to legal proceedings.\nWe direct law enforcement agencies to our&nbsp;Law Enforcement Guidelines&nbsp;page.</p>\n<p>We handle U.S.\nrequests in accordance with U.S.\nlaw.\nIf the request originates from a foreign jurisdiction, we will typically disclose information where we in good faith believe that disclosure is permitted by both U.S.\nlaw and local law.\nIn all cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>We may disclose user data where we reasonably believe that someone's life is at risk.\nFor example, if we become aware of a person threatening to commit suicide, we may share that person's data with appropriate entities that may have the ability to help.</p>\n<p>We may disclose user data to report suspected crimes.\nWe report content suspected of exploiting minors to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) along with the data identifying the uploading user.</p>\n<p>We may disclose user data in situations involving legal claims against us or one of our users.\nIf you submit a&nbsp;Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)&nbsp;or other takedown notice, we may share that notice with the affected user.\nIf you challenge such a notice, we may share your response with the complainant.</p>\n<p>We may share your data with potential transaction partners, advisors, and others in the event our company is, in whole or part, acquired by a third party.\nIn such case, we will use reasonable efforts to require the acquiring entity to comply with this Privacy Policy.</p>7.\nData Retention<p>We retain your data for as long as you have an account.\nWhen you close an account, we will delete its content, including its videos.\nWe may retain logs of automatically collected information (for internal analytics and security purposes).\nyour email address.\nyour tax information.\ncommunications with you.\nand your transactional information (for auditing, tax, and financial purposes).\nWhen we no longer have a business reason for retaining data, we will delete or anonymize it.</p>\n<p>We retain deleted videos on our servers for a short period in case you wish to reverse deletion.\nOnce we delete a video, we may not be able to recover it.\nIf you have previously made a video public, the video or its thumbnail may be discoverable in a search engine's cache for a time.\nWe have no control over search engines.\nhowever, we will, upon request, send a request for deletion to major search engines.</p>\n<p>If we receive legal process pertaining to your account, we will retain your data for as long as we in good faith believe is necessary to comply with the legal process.\nSimilarly, if we believe that your account has been involved in wrongdoing, we may preserve your data to defend or assert our rights.</p>8.\nYour Privacy Choices<p>We enable you to make numerous choices about your data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may choose not to provide us with certain information.\nFor example, you may choose not to create an account or not to provide optional account information.</li>\n<li>You may change your account and video privacy

our services we offer you the ability to limit the distribution of your content, including your videos.\nThis section explains some of your choices.</p>\n<strong>Profile</strong>\n<p>Some of our online subscription plans enable you to \"hide\" your profile or otherwise make it inaccessible on our website.\nYour profile will, however, remain accessible to persons who have access to your account or content.</p>\n<strong>Team Members</strong>\n<p>Some of our subscription plans enable you to grant account-level access rights to others.\nPersons with such access (\"<strong>Team Members</strong>\") may be able to see and potentially alter your data.\nYou may revoke or downgrade Team Member access at any time.</p>\n<strong>Videos</strong>\n<p>We enable you to manage the privacy settings of your videos.\nOn Vimeo.com, for example, your options, which depend on your subscription plan, may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Public (or \"anyone\"):</strong>&nbsp;Your video will be publicly-available.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Just you (i.e., \"only me\"):</strong>&nbsp;Your video will be available to you and authorized Team Members.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Selected people:</strong>&nbsp;Your video will be available to users you select (such as users you follow or specifically-designated users).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password-protected:</strong>&nbsp;Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the password you have set.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Private link:</strong>&nbsp;Your video may be accessed by anyone who enters the link assigned to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We provide similar options for our Livestream.com services.\nYou may change these settings at any time.\nChanges will be applied on a go-forward basis.\nYou should exercise caution in granting access to others.\nOnce you have granted access to someone else, you lose a degree of control over the distribution of your video as those persons may share the password and/or link with other people.\nRegardless of your profile or video privacy settings, Vimeo reserves the right to inspect them for compliance with its&nbsp;Terms of Service, to provide customer support, or to address technical issues.</p>10.\nCommunications from Us<strong>Emails</strong>\n<p>If you create an account, you may receive commercial emails from us.\nThis includes newsletters and offers.\nYou may always opt out from receiving commercial messages in your account settings.\nPlease note that any opt-out request may take several days to process and you will continue to receive transactional emails from us (e.g., emails confirming transactions and/or providing information about your account).</p>\n<strong>Mobile Device Communications</strong>\n<p>We may, with your consent, send push notifications in our apps.\nYou may disable these by declining them or changing the app's settings.\nTo the extent provided, we may, with your consent, send SMS messages to your mobile telephone for authentication and security purposes.\nYou may opt out of receiving such messages at any time.</p>11.\nProtecting Your Information<p>We use physical, technical, and organizational security measures to safeguard your data from unauthorized or accidental disclosure.\nDespite these efforts, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.\nUsers also have a role to play in keeping their data safe.\nWe encourage you to use a unique and hard-to-guess password for your account and to not share it with others.\nYou should only grant access rights to people who you know and trust, and, even then, you should be careful in granting all access rights.\nYou should monitor your account regularly.\nIf you believe that someone has gained access to your account without your permission, please contact us immediately so that we can investigate.</p>12.\nYour Responsibilities<p>You may receive other people's data in using our service.\nIf you receive information from other users, you must comply with all laws, including those concerning privacy, data security, and online marketing.</p>13.\nThird-Party Services<p>We may provide links to online services that we do not own or operate.\nThese services fall outside of this Privacy Policy and we have no control over the data they collect.\nFor example, if you click on an advertisement, you may be taken to the advertiser's website.\nOnce on a third-party site, your data may be collected by others.\nWe encourage you to read the privacy policies of such services before using them.</p>\n<p>You may use our service through third-party sites and to send you offers.\nFor example, you may watch a video that is embedded on a third-party site or use one of our apps on a third-party platform.\nThis Privacy Policy covers our apps and video players, but does not cover any third-party site or any third-party video player.</p>14.\nInternational Data Transfers and Certain User Rights<strong>14.1 Location of Data</strong>\n<p>Vimeo is based in the United States.\nWe provide services globally using computer systems, servers, and databases located in the U.S.\nand other countries.\nWhen you use our services from outside of the U.S., your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S..\nPlease note that U.S.\ndata and privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in your country.\nResidents of certain countries may be subject to additional protections as set forth in <strong>Sections 14.2</strong> and <strong>14.3</strong> below.</p>\n<strong>14.2 GDPR (EEA and UK Users)</strong>\n<p>This <strong>Section 14.2</strong> applies only to natural persons residing in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (for the purpose of this section only, \"you\" or \"your\" shall be limited accordingly).\nIt is Vimeo's policy to comply with the EEA's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nIn accordance with the GDPR, we may transfer your personal information from your home country to the U.S.\n(or other countries) based upon the following legal bases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Legitimate business interests: We could not provide our services or comply with our legal obligations without transferring your personal information to the U.S.</li>\n<li>Our use of Standard Contractual Clauses (also known as \"Model Clauses\") where appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You have the right to: opt out of non-essential cookies (see our Cookie Policy).\naccess, correct, delete, restrict, or object to our use of your personal information.\nbe forgotten.\nport your data.\nand withdraw consents.\nWe enable exercise of these rights primarily through our services (which we reserve the right to modify).\nFor example, we allow users to change their information, download their videos, and close their accounts.\nWe also fulfil our obligations in response to direct requests.\nWe will endeavor to process requests within one month.\nPlease note that we may not be able to comply with requests to the extent that they would cause us to violate any law or infringe any other person's rights.\nWe reserve the right to request appropriate identification.\nWe will process requests free of charge unless they would impose an unreasonable cost on us.</p>\n<p>If you have a request, complaint or inquiry, please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address listed in <strong>Section 15</strong>.\nWe are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any issue.\nYou also have the right to file a complaint with the supervisory data protection authority of your jurisdiction.</p>\n<strong>14.3 California Users</strong>\n<p>Under California\u2019s \u201cShine the Light\u201d law, California residents have the right to opt out of disclosing information to third parties for the purpose of allowing such third parties to directly market their products and services.\nAt this time, we do not engage in this type of disclosure.</p>\n<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), California consumers have the following rights, which can be exercised directly or in certain cases, through an authorized agent:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to request information about the categories and sources of personal information we collect, our purposes for collecting the information, and the types of third parties that receive that information.\nDetails about our data collection, use and third-party disclosures can be found here.\nIn addition, you have the right to request a copy of your personal information.\nYou may exercise this right once per 12-month period by using this form.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to Delete.</strong> You have the right to request that we delete some or all of the personal information that we have about you.\nDeleting all data will typically require the deletion of your account, along with all content, including your videos.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, we may retain information to provide services you have ordered, complete transactions, honor opt-outs, prevent fraud, spam, and other abuse, comply with our legal obligations, cooperate with law enforcement, and to exercise and defend our rights.\nYou may exercise your right to delete using this form.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Not Sell.</strong> You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information, and to request information about whether we have sold your personal information in the past 12 months.\nWhen you use our services, we may share your personal information with advertising partners in a way that may constitute a sale under the CCPA.\nYou may opt out via the link provided on the relevant page or app.\nIf we do not provide an opt-out mechanism, it is because we do not believe in good faith that your personal information is being sold.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Non-Discrimination.</strong> We won\u2019t discriminate against you because you exercise any rights herein.</p>\n<p>To exercise your rights to know and delete, we must be able to verify your identity as the owner of the Vimeo account you are inquiring about.\nWe may not be able to fulfill your request until we can do so.\nIn general, we verify identity by confirming that you are the owner of the email address associated with the account.\nAn authorized agent submitting a request on your behalf must also have access to the email address associated with the account, along with sufficient evidence that you have authorized that person to submit the request on your behalf.\nAlthough you need not have a Vimeo account to submit a request, we may not be able to locate certain information to process your request if you don\u2019t have one.</p>\n<strong>14.4 Nevada Users</strong>\n<p>Nevada residents have the right to opt out of the sale of certain \"covered information\" collected by operators of websites or online services.\nWe currently do not sell covered information, as \"sale\" is defined by such law, and we don't have plans to sell this information.\nHowever, if you would like to be notified if we decide in the future to sell personal information covered by the Act, you can provide us with your name and email address here.\nYou are responsible for updating any change in your email address by the same method and we are not obligated to cross-reference other emails you may have otherwise provided us for other purposes.&nbsp;We will maintain this information and contact you if our plans change.\nAt that time, we will create a process for verifying your identity and providing an opportunity to verified consumers to complete their opt-out.\nPlease become familiar with our data practices as set forth in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;We may share your data as explained in this Privacy Policy, such as to enhance your experiences and our services, and those activities will be unaffected by a Nevada do not sell request.</p>15.\nHow to Contact Us<p>For any questions, inquiries, or complaints relating to your privacy, please contact us at:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Vimeo.com,

litigation.\nIn an arbitration, your rights will be determined by a neutral third party called an arbitrator, and not a judge or jury.\nBoth you and Vimeo are entitled to fundamentally fair proceedings at every stage of the arbitration, including the hearing.\nThe arbitrator will decide all issues relating to the dispute, including the question of arbitrability, and can grant any relief that a court could grant.\nDecisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.\nFor details on the arbitration process, see our&nbsp;Arbitration Procedures.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Definitions:</strong>&nbsp;A \u201c<strong>Covered Privacy Claim</strong>\u201d means any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to (a)

(including viewing and search history), but does not include content that you upload (except to the extent the content contains personal information about you).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Small Claims Court Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Notwithstanding the above, each party has the right to bring an individual Covered Privacy Claim against the other in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 1 of JAMS\u2019&nbsp;Minimum Consumer Standards.\nIf one party files an arbitration that could be litigated in such a small claims court, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court.\nIf the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be administratively closed.\nIf requested after the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall administratively close the arbitration so long as the proceedings are at an early stage and no hearing has occurred.</p>\n<strong>12.\nGeneral Provisions</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Reservation of Rights, Severability:</strong>&nbsp;Vimeo reserves all rights not expressly granted herein.\nVimeo\u2019s rights

assigns.\nYou may not assign this Agreement to any person whose account has been terminated by Vimeo or who is prohibited from registering.\nany such assignment will be void.\nExcept as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement confers any right on any third party.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Entire Agreement:</strong>&nbsp;This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding of the parties and
