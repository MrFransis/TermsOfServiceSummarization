wagering on racing and that such behaviour can have negative impacts for individuals and local communities.</p>\n<p>According to the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, responsible gambling for individuals means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>they may gamble for pleasure and entertainment but are aware of their likelihood of losing and understand the associated risks;</li>\n<li>they exercise control over their gambling activity.\nand</li>\n<li>that responsible gambling occurs in balance with other activities in their lives and is not causing problems or harm for themselves or others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Responsible gambling for the broader community, including gambling providers, governments, and sporting associations, requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>shared responsibility for generating awareness of the risks associated with gambling;</li>\n<li>creating and promoting environments that prevent or minimise problem gambling.\nand</li>\n<li>being responsive to community concerns around gambling.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Racing.com is committed to the shared objectives of the racing industry, the Victorian Government and the Victorian gambling industry to foster responsible gambling as defined above and to minimise harm arising from problem gambling behaviour.</p>\n<p>In particular, Racing.com commits to promote responsible gambling messages and practices throughout its digital assets.\nRacing.com has enshrined this commitment in its editorial policy which provides that Racing.com will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>not promote or glorify excessive gambling;</li>\n<li>offer a
