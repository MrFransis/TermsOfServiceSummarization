why you should read on\nand decide for yourself.\nBut at a minimum, absolutely every npm user\nshould understand:</p>\n<p>\n<em>The npm public registry is for making software available to everyone\nonline.</em>\n</p>\n<p>But: <em>Software comes from people, and says something about us.</em>\n</p>\n<p>So: <em>Think carefully about what packages to publish, what data you put\nin those packages, and what others might do with that data.</em>\n</p>\n<p>When you create an account, certain contact information is displayed\npublicly in the npm platform.\nAnd when you upload a package, your name\nand contact information may become associated with that package.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself in a jam, email privacy@npmjs.com.</p>\nHow does npm collect data about me?\n<p>npm collects data about you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>when you use the npm command, the npx command or another program to access the npm public registry, Enterprise registries that npm hosts, private packages, such as when you're publishing a software package, and APIs for functionality like account and permissions management</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when you browse the npm website, npmjs.com</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when you use either the npm command or the website to create an npm account, update your account, and sign up for npm services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when you send support, privacy, legal, and other requests to npm</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>when working with and researching current and potential customers</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When researching potential customers, npm staff sometimes search the\npublic World Wide Web or paid business databases.\nOtherwise, npm\ndoesn't buy or receive data about you from data brokers or other\nprivate services.</p>\n<p>npm may inadvertently collect data about you if it is included in\nsoftware packages that you or others upload.</p>\nWhat data does npm collect about me, and why?\nnpm collects data about how you use npm software and registries.\n<p>When you use the <code>npm</code> command, the <code>npx</code> command, or other software to work\nwith the npm public registry, an Enterprise registry that npm hosts, or\nprivate packages, npm logs data that might be identified to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a random, unique identifier, called <code>npm-session</code>, for each time you\nrun commands like <code>npm install</code>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the names and versions of your project's dependencies, their\ndependencies, and so on, that come from the npm public registry,\nbut not of other dependencies, like Git\ndependencies</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the versions of Node.js, the npm command, and the operating system\nyou are using</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>an <code>npm-in-ci</code> header, showing whether the command was run on a\ncontinuous integration server</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the scope of the package for which you ran <code>npm install</code>, as an\n<code>npm-scope</code> header</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>a <code>referrer</code> header that shows the command you ran, with any file or\ndirectory paths redacted</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>data about the software you're using to access the registry, such\nas the <code>User-Agent</code> string</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>network request data, such as the date and time, your IP address,\nand the URL</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>npm uses this data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>fulfill your requests, such as by sending the packages you ask for</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>send you alerts about security vulnerabilities that may affect the\nsoftware you're building, when you run <code>npm install</code> or <code>npm audit</code>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>keep registries working quickly and reliably</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>debug and develop the <code>npm</code> command and other software</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>defend registries from abuse and technical attacks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>compile statistics on package usage and popularity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>prepare reports on trends in the developer community</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>improve search results on the website</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>recommend packages that may be relevant to your work</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nnpm collects data about how you use the website.\n<p>When you visit www.npmjs.com,\ndocs.npmjs.com, and other npm\nwebsites, npm uses cookies, server logs, and other methods to collect\ndata about what pages you visit, and when.\nnpm also collects technical\ninformation about the software and computer you use, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>your IP address</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>your preferred language</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the web browser software you use</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the kind of computer you use</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the website that referred you</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>npm uses data about how you use the website to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>optimize the website, so that it's quick and easy to use</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>diagnose and debug technical errors</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>defend the website from abuse and technical attacks</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>compile statistics on package popularity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>compile statistics on the kinds of software and computers visitors\nuse</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>compile statistics on visitor searches and needs, to guide\ndevelopment of new website pages and functionality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>decide who to contact about about product announcements, service\nchanges, and new features</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nnpm collects account data.\n<p>Many features of npm services require an npm account.\nFor example, you\nmust have an npm account to publish packages to the npm public registry.</p>\n<p>To create an npm account, npm requires a working email address and an\navailable user name.\nnpm uses this data to provide you access to\nfeatures and identify you across npm services, publicly and within npm.</p>\n<p>You do not have to give your personal or legal name to create an npm\naccount.\nYou can use a pseudonym instead.\nYou can also open more than\none account.</p>\n<p>If you sign up for an account, then npm will publish account data for\nthe whole world to see on user pages like this one.\nnpm also publishes account data through the npm public registry, which is available for everyone to see, and Enterprise registries that npm hosts for others to\nfind with commands like npm owner ls tap.</p>\n<p>If you give npm a personal name or names on social media like\nGitHub and\nTwitter through the website, like\nwhen you include this on your profile or user page, npm publishes that\ndata along with the email address and user name for the account.\nYou\ndon't have to give npm a personal name or any social media names, and\nyou can remove this data at any time by updating your user page.</p>\n<p>npm uses your email to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>notify you about packages published using your account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>reset your password and help keep your account secure</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>add metadata to packages that you publish</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>contact you in special circumstances related to your account or packages</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>contact you about support requests</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>contact you about legal requests, like DMCA takedown requests and privacy complaints</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>announce new npm product offerings, service changes, and features</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>send you tips about how to better use free and paid services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>send you messages about paid services you might want</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nnpm collects package data.\n<p>When you use npm publish or other software to publish packages to the\nnpm public registry, an Enterprise registry that npm hosts, or as a\nprivate package, npm collects the contents of the package, plus\nmetadata,\nincluding your account data.\nOther npm users may also publish packages\nthat include data about you, such as the fact that you contributed code\nto a package.</p>\n<p>npm uses data in packages to provide those packages to you and others\nwho request them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When you publish a package to the npm public registry, or change a\npackage from private to public, npm makes the package and metadata\navailable to everyone, online.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you publish a package to an Enterprise registry that npm hosts,\nor as a private package, npm makes all of that data available to\nother users according to how the registry or the private packages\naccount is configured.\nYou may be able to configure who can access\nthe package, or that may be up to others, such as the\nadministrator of your company's Enterprise registry.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Making package data available to others allows them to download, build\non, and depend on your work.</p>\nnpm collects payment card data.\n<p>To sign up for paid services, npm requires your payment card data.\nnpm\nitself does not collect or store enough information to charge your card\nitself.\nRather, Stripe collects\nthat data on npm's behalf, and gives npm security tokens that allow npm\nto create charges and subscriptions.</p>\n<p>npm uses your payment card data only to charge for npm services.</p>\n<p>npm instructs Stripe to store your\npayment card data only as long as you use paid npm services.</p>\nnpm collects data about current and potential customers.\n<p>npm's sales and marketing teams collect information about npm users who\nmight like to try npm paid services, as individuals or through\norganizations.\nnpm also collects data about customer personnel, such as\nlists of people who need Enterprise registry accounts or access to\nchannels for technical support.\nWhen npm's sales and marketing teams\nsend email to current and potential customers, they collect data about\nwhether those messages get read, and whether readers follow hyperlinks.</p>\n<p>npm's sales team also uses public World Wide Web searches and paid\nbusiness databases to research who users work for, and their positions,\nbased on account data like name or email address.\nThe vast majority of\nthis data is publicly available.</p>\n<p>npm uses data about current and potential customer personnel to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>ensure npm meets its obligations to provide access, support, and\nother services under contracts for paid services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>decide which people to contact about product announcements, service\nchanges, and new features</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ensure that people who opt out do not receive any more messages\nabout npm services and upgrades</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>keep track of how users express interest in npm products and\nservices over time</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>decide who should receive email about product announcements, service\nchanges, and new features</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nnpm collects data about correspondence.\n<p>npm collects data about you when you send npm support requests, legal\ncomplaints, privacy inquiries, and business inquiries.\nThose data\nusually include your name and email address, and may include your\ncompany or other affiliation.</p>\n<p>npm uses contact data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>respond to you</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>compile aggregate statistics about correspondence</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>train support staff and other npm personnel</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>review the performance of npm personnel who respond</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>defend npm from legal claims</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nnpm collects data about use of npm.community.\n<p>npm collects data about visits, user accounts, and forum data on\nnpm.community, the discussion\nforum for users of npm products and services.\nnpm uses data from\nnpm.community to collaborate with the development community, and to\ninform development decisions about the command-line interface and other\nsoftware.</p>\nDoes npm share data about me with others?\n<p>npm shares account data with others as mentioned in the section about\naccount data.</p>\n<p>npm shares package data with others as mentioned in the section about\npackage data.</p>\n<p>npm publishes posts and other content you submit to npm.community.</p>\n<p>npm does not sell information about you to others.\nHowever, npm uses\nservices provided by other companies to provide npm services.\nThe types\nof service providers that npm uses include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Companies that enable us to offer features on our website, such as to display your avatar</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Companies that facilitate the efficient distribution of content</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cloud computing platforms and services that host our discussion forums</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Services that assist with the detection of spam, scams, abuse\nothers, or other violations of our terms of service</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payment processors</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Companies that assist us with marketing, such as to store data about\ncurrent and potential customers or to enable us to send email to users, such as newsletters</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platforms to help us receive, manage, and respond to support requests</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platforms for internal communication</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nnpm uses cookies.\n<p>npm's website uses Google Analytics to collect and analyze data about\nvisitors to its websites.\nYou can read the privacy policy for Google\nAnalytics online.\nYou can opt out of Google Analytics by installing a free browser\nextension.</p>\n<p>npm uses\nHubSpot\nto track which parts of npm websites you visit so we know which updates\nand service email messages to send you.\nWe also use HubSpot to track\nwhen you create accounts and Orgs, when you change Orgs from free to\npaid, and when you add seats to Orgs, in order to share tips on how to\nuse Orgs, to send you marketing messages about the benefits of paid\nservices, and to notify our sales team that you might want paid\nservices.\nFinally, HubSpot collects data from forms on our website that\nyou must fill out to access some marketing content.\nYou can read the\nprivacy policy for HubSpot\nonline.</p>\nHow can I make choices about data collection?\n<p>You choose what data the npm publish command includes in package data.\nYou can use an .npmignore\nfile in your package to keep specific files out of the package.\nYou can\nalso use a files list in package.json\nfiles to\ninstruct npm to include only specific files that you name, in addition\nto standard files like <code>README</code> files, <code>LICENSE</code> files, and package.json.</p>\n<p>To double check the data that you will share in a package that you plan\nto publish, run the <code>npm publish --dry-run</code> command.\nIf you are running\nan older version of the npm command, run the npm pack command to create a\ntarball,\nthen check its contents, such as with <code>tar tvzf $tarball</code>.</p>\n<p>To publish a package to the npm public registry, npm's terms of service\nrequire you to license npm to share it.\nIf a package is made public, it is available for everyone online to see.\nHowever, your choice of public license for your package\nmay affect what others can do with data about you in your package.</p>\n<p>npm does not respond to the Do Not Track HTTP header.</p>\nWhere does npm keep data about me?\n<p>npm stores account data, data about website use, data about registry\nuse, and private packages on servers in the United States of America.\nmetadata about those packages worldwide, via content delivery\nnetworks.</p>\n<p>npm stores package data published to Enterprise registries that npm\nhosts, plus metadata about them, in cloud computing zones of customers' choosing.</p>\n<p>By using the npm platform, you consent to the collection and storage of\nyour data as outlined in this section.</p>\nHow does npm handle data under the EU General Data Protection Regulation?\n<p>npm respects privacy rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679,\nthe European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nnpm\nprocesses \"Personal Data\" on the following legal bases: (1) with your\nconsent.\n(2) as necessary to perform our agreement to provide our\nservices.\nand (3) as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing\nour services where those interests do not override your fundamental\nrights and freedom related to data privacy.\nInformation we collect may\nbe transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any\nother country in which we or our

Act\n(CCPA)].\nWhere we collect information that is subject to the\nCCPA, that information we collect and your rights are described below.</p>\n<p>Categories of personal information we collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Personal Identifiers</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Name and email address when you create an account.\nYou will also\nbe asked to create a username and we will assign one or more\nunique identifiers to your profile.\nWe use this information to\nprovide our services, respond to your requests, and send\ninformation to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also collect your social media handle and basic account\ninformation if you provide it to us or interact with our\nservices, such as our help desk, through social media.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We collect your payment information through our service\nprovider, Stripe, as described above.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Internet or Other Electronic Network Activity Information</em>: device\nidentifiers such as IP address and user agent.\nthe assigned unique\nIDs in cookies (as described below).\ninformation about how you\narrived at and navigated through our Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Geolocation Data:</em> We do not collect your specific longitude and\nlatitude.\nHowever, we do collect imprecise location (e.g., your IP address).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Professional or employment-related information:</em> If you apply for\nemployment with us, information about your employment history.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Education information:</em> If you apply for employment with us,\ninformation about your educational history.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may collect any other information about you contained in software\npackages uploaded to our site, as described above under the \"npm\ncollects package data\" section.\nWe also collect the contents of your\ncommunications with us, e.g., when you submit a question to us through\na web form or comments to us on social media.</p>\n<p>We may disclose any of the categories of personal information listed\nabove and use them for the above-listed purposes or for other business\nor operational purposes compatible with the context in which the\npersonal information was collected.\nOur disclosures of personal\ninformation include disclosures to our \"service providers,\" which are\ncompanies that we engage for business purposes to conduct activities\non our behalf.\nThe categories of service providers with whom we share\ninformation and the services they provide are described below.</p>\n<p>Rights under CCPA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Access/Right to Know</em>: You have the right to request access to\npersonal information we collected about you and information\nregarding the source of that personal information, the purposes\nfor which we collect it, and the third parties and service\nproviders with whom we share it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Deletion</em>: You have the right to request that we erase data we have\ncollected from you.\nPlease note that we may have a reason to deny\nyour deletion request or delete data in a more limited way than\nyou anticipated, e.g., because of a legal obligation to retain it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To exercise your rights above, you can email us at\nprivacy@npmjs.com.\nWhen we\nprocess your request, we must verify your identity by asking you to\n(1) provide personal identifiers that we can match against information\nwe may have collected from you previously.\nand (2) confirm your\nrequest using the email stated in the request.</p>\n<p>Opt-out of sale:</p>\n<p>California residents have the right to request that we stop \"selling\"\ntheir personal information.\nA \"sale\" of personal information is\ndefined broadly: \"selling, renting, releasing, disclosing,\ndisseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise\ncommunicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a\nconsumer's personal information by the business to another business or\na third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.\" We do not\nsell your information as defined by the CCPA.</p>\n<p>Please note that your right to opt out does not apply to our sharing\nof personal information with service providers, who are parties we\nengage to perform a function on our behalf and are contractually\nobligated to use the Personal Information only for that function.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose information to other entities who are not listed\nhere when required by law or to protect our Company or other persons,\nas described in our Privacy Policy.</p>\nHow can I see what data is publicly available about me?\n<p>You can access your account data at any time by visiting your account\npage on www.npmjs.com.\nYour\naccount page also lists all the packages published under your account or\nother accounts.</p>\n<p>You can access package data by downloading the packages, as long as\nthey're public or you have permission to access them.</p>\n<p>You can see metadata about packages by running npm info $package, or by\naccessing the appropriate registry's\nAPI.\nRegistry APIs provide metadata in standard JSON\nformat, and packages as\ntarballs).</p>\nHow can I change data about me?\n<p>You can change your personal account data and payment card data at any\ntime by visiting your account settings page on\nwww.npmjs.com.\nYou can change\naccount and payment data for Enterprise by contacting support.</p>\n<p>You can close your npm account at any time by e-mailing\ncontacting support.\nClosing\nyour account removes the profile from the public registry but does not\nautomatically erase packages published under your account.\nWe may retain\nsome data about you internally even where you close your account.</p>\n<p>npm's unpublish policy\ndetermines when you can erase packages from the npm public registry.\nThe\nunpublish policy strikes a difficult balance between the purpose of\npublishing and hosting packages, others' reliance on what has been made\npublic, and individual rights and freedoms.</p>\n<p>If another user improperly publishes personal data about you, in a\npackage or otherwise, email\nprivacy@npmjs.com.</p>\n<p>Please note that while npm publishes notices about published data\nthat's been erased,\nnpm can't make everyone who has downloaded published package data or\naccount data erase that data on your behalf.\nChoosing a public\nlicense, such as an open source software license,\nmay encourage and allow storage, distribution, and use of package data\nindefinitely.\nNearly all popular open source software licenses actually\nrequire preserving personal data that attributes the software to you,\nsuch as copyright notices, as a condition of permission for the\nsoftware.</p>\nWhat is npm's policy on unpublishing packages?\n<p>Please see our policy on \"unpublishing\" packages or\nour terms of service for more\ninformation on erasing packages].</p>\n<p>If you accidentally publish a package that threatens your privacy, or\ndiscover someone else has published a package that does, email\nprivacy@npmjs.com immediately.\nnpm can and will take down packages in specific, exceptional situations\nto protect you, especially if others violate your privacy.\nUsing npm to\nviolate others' privacy is against our terms of\nservice.</p>\nHow does npm notify others about published data that's erased?\n<p>npm takes a few steps to notify others who may be copying data from the\nnpm public registry that published data has been erased:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>npm publishes new placeholder versions of some erased packages, with\n<code>README</code> files that mention the package has been erased, and why.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>npm's registry APIs,\nspecial software services that others use to copy data from the\nnpm public registry, send update messages about packages that have\nbeen erased.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nWhat happens if npm merges with or is bought by another company?\n<p>We may transfer to another entity or its affiliates or service providers\nsome or all information about you in connection with, or during\nnegotiations of, any merger, acquisition, sale of assets or any line of\nbusiness, change in ownership control, or financing transaction.\nWe\ncannot promise that an acquiring party or the merged entity will have\nthe same privacy practices or treat your information the same as\ndescribed in this Policy.</p>\nWhat are npm's information practices regarding information belonging to children?\n<p>npm's site and services are intended for users age sixteen and older.\nnpm does not knowingly collect information from children.\nIf we discover\nthat we have inadvertently collected information from anyone younger\nthan the age of 16, we will delete that information.</p>\nWho can I contact about npm and my privacy?\n<p>You may email us directly at privacy@npmjs.com\nwith the subject line \"Privacy Concerns.\" You may also contact our Data\nProtection Officer directly.</p>\n<p>Our United States HQ:</p>\n<p>GitHub Data Protection Officer<br>Attention: npm Data Protection<br>88 Colin P.\nKelly Jr.\nSt.<br>San Francisco, CA 94107<br>United States</p>\n<p>or our EU Office:</p>\n<p>GitHub

Conduct</em>).</p>\n<p>npm permits use of npm trademarks per the policy at\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/policies/trademark.</p>\nUse of npm Open Source\n<p>Subject to these Terms, npm grants you permission to use npm Open\nSource.\nThat permission is not exclusive to you, and you cannot transfer\nit to anyone else.</p>\n<p>Your permission to use npm Open Source entitles you to do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You may search for, download, publish, and manage packages of\ncomputer code (<em>Packages</em>) in the Public Registry, and otherwise\ninteract with the Public Registry, via the command-line tool\npublished by npm at https://www.github.com/npm/npm (the <em>CLI</em>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may search for, download, publish, and manage Packages

as any permission you\nmay have to use Paid Services, are subject to the following conditions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use npm Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may not use npm Services after npm says you may not, such as by\ndisabling your Account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You must use npm Services only in accordance with \"Acceptable Use\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may access and use data about the security of Packages, such\nas vulnerability reports, audit status reports, and supplementary\nsecurity documentation, only for your own personal or internal\nbusiness purposes.\nYou may <em>not</em> provide others access to, copies\nof, or use of npm data about the security of Packages, directly\nor as part of other products or services.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAcceptable Use\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You will abide by the\nCode of Conduct and the\nDispute Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not submit material to npm as a package or in any other\nform that violates npm's <em>Acceptable Content</em>, described below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not disclose information that you do not have the right to\ndisclose, such as confidential information of others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not copy or share any personally identifiable information of\nany other person without their specific permission.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not violate any applicable law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not use or attempt to use another person's Account without\ntheir specific permission.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not buy, sell, or otherwise trade in user names,\norganization names, names for <em>Packages</em>, or any other names\nreserved on <em>npm Services</em>, for money or other compensation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not use <em>npm Services</em>' ability to send e-mail to send\nadvertisements, chain letters, or other solicitations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not automate access to, use, or monitor the Website, such\nas with a web crawler, browser plug-in or add-on, or other computer\nprogram that is not a web browser.\nYou may replicate data from the\nPublic Registry using the Public APIs per this Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not use npm Services to send email to distribution lists,\nnewsgroups, or group mail aliases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not falsely imply that you are affiliated with or endorsed\nby npm.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not operate illegal schemes, such as pyramid schemes, via\nnpm Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not deep-hyperlink to images or other non-hypertext content\nserved by npm Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not remove any marking indicating proprietary ownership\nfrom any material got via npm Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not display any portion of the Website via an HTML IFRAME.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not disable, avoid, or circumvent any security or access\nrestrictions of npm Services, or access parts of npm Services not\nintended for access by you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not strain infrastructure of npm Services with an\nunreasonable volume of requests, or requests designed to impose an\nunreasonable load on IT systems underlying npm Services.\nThis rule\nis intentionally loose, to give npm the flexibility it needs to keep\nnpm Services working for the user community as a whole.\nBut to draw\none clear line, under no circumstances are five million requests to\nnpm Services in a single month-long period by any single individual,\norganization, or group of affiliated companies remotely reasonable.\nIf\nyou have a special need to make lots and lots of requests, our\nsales team can help.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not encourage or assist any other person in violation of\n\"Acceptable Use\".</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAcceptable Content\n<p>Administrators at npm reserve the right to delete content hosted on\nthe npm Services that they deem unacceptable.\nUnacceptable content\ncan take the form of a package, a README file, a user or organization\nname, or any other content submitted to npm Services.\nA few examples\nof unacceptable content:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Content that is illegal, offensive, or otherwise harmful.\nThis includes\ncontent that is harassing, inappropriate, or abusive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Content in violation of law, infringing the intellectual property\nrights of others, violating the privacy or other rights of others,\nor in violation of any agreement with a third party.\nThis includes\ncode that violates a public license for others' work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Content containing malicious computer code, such as computer viruses,\ncomputer worms, rootkits, back doors, or spyware.\nThis\nincludes content submitted for research purposes unless agreed to\nin advance by npm.\nTools designed and documented explicitly to\nassist in security research are acceptable, but proof-of-concept\nexploits are not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Packages that are not functionally compatible with the npm\ncommand-line client.\nFor example, a \"package\" cannot simply be\na PNG or JPEG image, a movie file, or a text document uploaded\ndirectly to the registry.\nUsing the Public Registry as a general purpose database is not allowed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Content that exists only to \"reserve\" a name, whether a package name,\nuser name, or organization name.\nThe\nDispute Policy governs\nhow npm handles such cases of \"squatting\".</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To find out how to report violations of Acceptable Content, refer to the\nCode of Conduct.</p>\nCommercial Content\n<p>The npm Public Registry is about Packages.\nAll manner of\nuseful Packages are welcome, from hobby projects to\ncompetitive products, enterprise infrastructure and tooling\nto the latest fun hack or work of software art.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the npm Public Registry, the Website, and\nimportant conventions like <code>README</code> go beyond just code.\nDevelopers use all of those channels to communicate more\nbroadly about code, who is developing it, why, and how.</p>\n<p>That communication is important, and welcome, so long as it\nrespects that the npm Public Registry, the website, and npm\nOpen Source more generally remain neutral.\nYou are free to\nuse npm Open Source for commercial projects, to advance your\ncareer, and for other business purposes.\nBut you may not\nleverage content or system conventions to make the npm\nPublic Registry, Website, or CLI put business before code.</p>\n<p>These kinds of commercial content are generally acceptable\nin <code>README</code> files and other documentation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Credits, acknowledgments, attributions, and other\nrecognitions of contributions to Packages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information on how to pay, donate to, and otherwise\nsupport Package development, Package developers, and\nPackage steward organizations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logos from, and links to, organizations developing,\nstewarding, or sponsoring Package development.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information on paid products and services related to\nPackages, such as enhanced versions, add-ons, commercial\nlicense terms, training, integration, or support.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These kinds of commercial content generally <em>aren't</em>\nacceptable:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<code>README</code>, <code>package.json</code>, or other content displaying\nadvertisements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Packages that display ads at runtime, on installation,\nor at other stages of the software development\nlifecycle, such as via npm\nscripts.\nPackages\nwith code that can be used to display ads are fine.\nPackages that themselves display ads are not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Packages that function primarily as ads, with only\nplaceholder or negligible code, data, and other\ntechnical content.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These examples are just examples.\nnpm will continue to\napply its judgment when deciding what content is acceptable.\nnpm will continue to expect you to apply your own judgment\nwhen choosing what you share and how.\n</p>\nEnforcement of Acceptable Use\n<p>npm may investigate and prosecute violations of this Agreement to the\nfullest legal extent.\nnpm may notify and cooperate with law enforcement\nauthorities in prosecuting violations of this Agreement.</p>\nYour Account\n<p>You must create and log into an Account to access features of some npm\nServices, including npm Open Source.</p>\n<p>To create an Account, you must provide certain information about\nyourself, as required by the account creation form on the Website or the\nCLI.\nIf you create an Account, you will provide, at a minimum, a valid\nemail address.\nYou will keep that email address up-to-date.\nYou will\nnot impersonate any other individual.\nYou may delete your Account at any\ntime by contacting support.</p>\n<p>You will be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether\nauthorized by you or not, until you either close your account or give\nnpm notice that the security of your Account has been compromised.\nYou will notify npm immediately if you suspect the security of your\nAccount has been compromised.\nYou will select a secure password for your\nAccount.\nYou will keep your password secret.</p>\n<p>npm may restrict, suspend, or terminate your Account according to the\nCopyright Policy, if npm reasonably believes that you are in breach of\nthese Terms, or if npm reasonably believes that you have misused npm\nServices.</p>\nYour Content\n<p>Nothing in this Agreement gives npm any ownership rights in intellectual\nproperty that you share with npm Services, such as your Account\ninformation or any Packages you share with npm Services (<em>Your\nContent</em>).\nNothing in this Agreement gives you any ownership rights in\nnpm intellectual property provided via npm Services, like software,\ndocumentation, trademarks, service marks, logotypes, or other\ndistinguishing graphics.</p>\n<p>Between you and npm, you remain solely responsible for Your Content.\nYou\nwill not wrongly imply that Your Content is sponsored or approved by\nnpm.\nnpm will not be obligated to store, maintain, or provide copies of\nyour content, except per the Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>npm may remove Your Content from npm Services without notice if npm\nsuspects Your Content was submitted or used in violation of \"Acceptable\nUse\", as well as per the Copyright Policy.</p>\n<p>Your Content belongs to you.\nYou decide whether and how to license it.\nBut at a minimum, you license npm to provide Your Content to users\nof npm Services when you share Your Content.\nThat special license\nallows npm to copy, publish, and analyze Your Content, and to share\nits analyses with others.\nnpm may run computer code in Your Content to\nanalyze it, but npm's special license alone does not give npm the right\nto run code for its functionality in npm products or services.</p>\n<p>When Your Content is removed from npm Services,\nwhether by you or npm, npm's special license ends when the last copy\ndisappears from npm's backups, caches, and other systems.\nOther\nlicenses, such as open source licenses, may continue after Your Content\nis removed.\nThose licenses may give others, or npm itself, the right to\nshare Your Content with npm Services again.</p>\n<p>Others who receive Your Content via npm Services may violate the terms\non which you license Your Content.\nYou agree that npm will not be liable\nto you for those violations or their consequences.</p>\nFeedback\n<p>npm welcomes your feedback and suggestions for npm Services.\nYou agree\nthat npm will be free to act on feedback and suggestions you provide\nwithout further notice, consent, or payment.\nYou will not submit\nfeedback or suggestions that you consider confidential or proprietary.</p>\nIndemnity\n<p>You will indemnify npm, its officers, directors, employees,\nrepresentatives, and agents, and hold them harmless for, all liability,\nexpenses, damages, and costs from any third-party claims, demands,\nlawsuits, or other proceedings alleging that Your Content, your use\nof npm Services, or both, violate the intellectual property right of\na third party, this Agreement, or applicable law.\nYou will not settle\nany such proceeding without the prior written consent of npm.\nnpm will\nnotify you of any such proceeding it becomes aware of.</p>\nDisclaimers\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Use of npm Services is at your sole risk.\nnpm Services are provided\non an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis.\nnpm

terminate this Agreement at any time with notice\nto the other.</p>\n<p>On termination of this Agreement, your permission to use npm Open\nSource, as well any permission you may have to access Paid Services\nunder additional terms, also terminate.</p>\n<p>The following provisions survive termination of this Agreement: \"Your\nContent\", \"Feedback\", \"Indemnity\", \"Disclaimers\", \"Limits on
