3152, "name": "Staff Code of Conduct", "url": "https://www.weasyl.com/policy/scoc", "xpath": "/html/body/div/div[3]", "text": " Staff Code of Conduct I.\nStaff-User Interaction <p>All staff members, regardless of rank, are expected to treat all members of the community with respect.\nIf a staff member is having difficulty dealing with any user to a point where they are unable to do their job effectively, it is suggested that the matter be brought to the attention of the Directors so that responsibility of the matter may be reassigned.\nThis may occur for a number of reasons, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The staff member knows the user personally and cannot function as an unbiased mediator.</li>\n<li>The user is being overtly rude to the staff member.</li>\n<li>The staff member is unsure of how to handle the situation and desires input from the rest of the staff.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Staff members are reminded to remain impartial in their positions.\nBribery, favoritism, coercion, and other such forms of biased and unbecoming conduct are strictly prohibited.\nIf a staff member feels their judgment may be clouded or otherwise impaired while working, they are expected to fully relinquish authority of the situation to another member of staff.</p>\n<p>All user information is confidential, and all interactions dealing with a user's account or personal information may only occur between the user in question and staff.\nStaff members will not give out information to third parties, including infraction information, ban reasons, IP addresses, or account activity details, without explicit permission from the user.\nHowever, any official requests sent from state or federal authorities will meet legal compliance from all staff.</p> II.\nInteraction Amongst Staff <p>All staff members are all encouraged to communicate with each other openly and fully, and to act with the utmost professionalism around their peers.\nStaff members may not reverse the decisions of other staff members without first discussing it with the staff member in question or the rest of the staff first.\nIf a conflict between any staff members arises, we urge those parties to bring that matter before the rest of the staff so the matter may be settled.\nIf the matter cannot be sorted out, all parties will be asked to take a temporary or permanent leave from the staff, depending on the nature of the dispute.</p>\n<p>In the event of a departmental dispute in which a department member disagrees with the actions or verdict of the department head, and the staff member feels the action may be detrimental to the site, the Directors may be called in to vote on the ruling.\nThe Directors' decision will be passed by a majority vote of greater than one-half of the Director team, and the Directors are free to choose to uphold the department head decision, or enact their own verdict.\nThe Directors may also act on their power to discipline staff members based on majority ruling if it is called for by the situation.</p>\n<p>If a staff member believes that they will not be around for an extended period of time, they are required to give the rest of the team an advance warning.\nFor security reasons, staff accounts found to be inactive for longer than two weeks will be temporarily removed from staff positions until the account owner returns and is ready to continue working.</p> III.\nRepresenting the Site <p>Staff are required to remain professional when dealing with issues publicly on the site as well as other sites.\nThis means that staff should not harass or defame other sites while being associated with Weasyl, as well as not deriding aspects of Weasyl itself.\nIf a staff member has issues with a policy or aspect of the site, they are asked to handle the issue privately in staff areas.</p>\n<p>Although staff are asked to remain professional while performing their duties, it is not required while they are using the site for their enjoyment.\nWe here at Weasyl wish for the site to be as open and fun as possible, and we want our staff to be able to enjoy the site themselves.\nAs long as the staff members follow the policies of this document and all other site policies, they are free to behave as they wish in regard to their own personal enjoyment of the site.</p> IV.\nSite Liability &amp.\nSecurity <p>Due to the nature of the content allowed on this site, we require all staff to be 18 years of age or older.\nWe recognize that age is not a reliable indicator of maturity.\nhowever, all staff must be able to legally view and respond to reports dealing with adult content.</p>\n<p>Any staff member partaking in illegal activities which put the site at risk will be immediately terminated.\nThis includes admitting to crimes in which the site must inform the police, as well as using site resources to provide or ask users to provide them with pirated copyrighted content.</p>\n<p>Staff members are forbidden from performing their duties while under the influence of any mind- altering substances.\nIf there is any indication that a staff member is operating under the influence, they will be temporarily locked out of their account.\nPrescription drugs are permissible, although we require that they seek approval from the rest of the staff before performing their duties if they affect a staff member's performance.</p>\n<p>All staff are expected to maintain proper account security.\nThis includes creating a secure password and making sure the email linked to their admin account is also secure.\nIf a staff member's account is compromised, they will be temporarily removed from staff and/or their account will be temporarily locked until the issue is resolved.\nIf the staff feels the affected member will continue to be a security risk, they may vote to have them removed from staff.</p>\n<p>In addition to user information, content from staff areas of the site are also confidential.\nThis includes staff forums, reports, site code, account information, and all other information privy to staff members only.\nStaff found leaking privileged information without proper authorization will be removed from their position, and possibly the site depending on the nature of the leak.</p> V.\nPromotions <p>Staff promotions will be initiated by the Directors when space becomes available for the appropriate positions or if a staff member has performed exceptionally in their duties.\nA user will be brought up for review and the voting members will be given time to state their reasons for or against the promotion.\nModerators will be promoted to admin status after the admin and Director staff vote.\nAdmins will be promoted to Director status after a vote from the Directors.</p>\n<p>Each member of the voting group will cast one vote.\nA decision will be passed with a majority vote of greater than two-thirds.\nIf the decision obtains between one-half and two-thirds of the possible votes, the topic will be discussed again and the staff will vote once more.\nAfter the second discussion and vote has taken place, a majority vote of of greater than one-half will pass the action.</p> VI.\nDisciplinary Action <p>Each infraction of site policy by a staff member will be treated on a case-by-case basis.\nIn the event that a staff member breaks any site rules, all relevant parties will be brought into a discussion with the Director team.\nAny staff member wishing to give input into a situation may contact the Director team privately so that their views may be taken into account.\nAfter considering all available relevant information, the Directors will determine a suitable punishment, including, but not limited to, demotion, temporary or permanent loss of status, or temporary or permanent removal from the site.\nA vote to enact the determined action must reach a majority of greater than one-half of the Directors.\nOwners may override any vote, but this will be reserved for only extreme circumstances related to the legal liability of the site.</p>\n<p>If a moderator is found to have broken site policy and requires demotion, they will be removed from staff.\nIf a Director requires disciplinary action, they may not take part in the vote concerning which actions will be taken.</p> ", "created_at": "2020-11-24 08:12:27.413149", "updated_at":

Upload Rules A.\nRight to Submit <p>Weasyl respects the rights of artists with regard to the distribution of their original works.\nas such, there are two types of artwork that you may upload: artwork that you have created, and artwork that has been created by others for you.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Original Content Submissions:</strong> If you are a creator of a particular work, whether you created it individually or in collaboration with others, you automatically hold the rights to its distribution.\nContent of this type belongs in your submissions gallery.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Weasyl Collections Feature:</strong> Weasyl has a collections feature.\nThe feature makes it possible for the original creator of a work to offer a submission to another Weasyl user, so that that work will appear in both galleries.\nThe use of the collections feature <em>is optional!</em> If you have permission from the original creator and you do not wish to use the Weasyl collections feature, you are welcome to upload it to your own gallery, providing: the work has been created by someone else for you.\nor features you, your character(s), or intellectual property.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tracing and Plagiarism:</strong> You may incorporate the work of others into new works.\nhowever, the use of borrowed content must either abide by fair use or you must obtain permission from the copyright holder.\nThe submission will be removed if it meets neither of these requirements.\nIf it does meet these requirements, you must still cite the content\u2019s source in the submission description.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Proper Citation:</strong> If you are uploading a submission that was made for you by another person, you must cite the name of the original creator in the submission\u2019s description.\nIf the creator was an anonymous contributor, please state so in the description.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Copyright and Trademark:</strong> The creator of the content of a submission holds the copyright and rights to its distribution.\nunless the content is trademarked by someone else, is considered harassment, or is otherwise a violation of Weasyl policy, the submission will not be removed.\nFor further information, see our Copyright Policy.</li>\n</ol> B.\nAccurately Describing Content <ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Ratings</strong>\n<p>Content ratings should be made based on the context of your submission and its intended audience, as well as on the content of descriptions, tags, and comments supplied by the uploader.\nWe ask that you please rate your content appropriately.\nFor more information on rating your content, please see our Ratings Guidelines.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>General</strong>\n<p>Content categorized as General is appropriate for all audiences of all ages.\nIt may contain at most very mild themes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Mature (18+.\nNO sexually explicit content)</strong>\n<p>Content categorized as Mature may contain imagery, themes, or material that is not suitable for minors.\nHowever, such content must not contain graphic depictions of sexual content, sexual acts, or sexual arousal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Explicit (18+.\nwith sexually explicit content)</strong>\n<p>An extension of the Mature rating for content containing graphic depictions of sexual content or sexual acts.\nThis may contain overt sexual acts or signs of sexual arousal.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tagging</strong>\n<p>Weasyl\u2019s tag system is an essential tool for users to find what they\u2019re looking for, making it important for uploaders to add relevant tags to their work.\nWhen submitting artwork, we ask that you supply at least two tags that describe the submission.\nProper tagging also benefits you as an uploader by helping to increase exposure to your work.</p>\n<p>Because it\u2019s possible that an uploader might miss something, users have the ability to add additional tags to others\u2019 works.\nUsers found to be abusing this ability (e.g.\nadding harassing or irrelevant tags) may have their right to tag others\u2019 works revoked.\nLikewise, uploaders removing relevant tags without good reason may be subject to moderation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Custom Thumbnails</strong>\n<p>While using a portion of the actual submission is not required when creating its thumbnail, tricking users into viewing sexually explicit or otherwise unanticipated content by applying a misleading thumbnail is prohibited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Streaming</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Videos and streams that utilize the Streaming Now feature must represent a creative effort from the broadcaster.</li>\n<li>Only the artist who is streaming may promote the stream via the Streaming Now feature.</li>\n<li>Streams featuring movies, television shows, or other copyrighted content are prohibited from use of the Streaming Now feature.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Critique</strong>\n<p>The critique feature is for artists who are actively seeking artistic critique of their work.\nUsers may utilize the Critique feature only for content created in part or in whole by them.\nFurthermore, the critique feature should only be used when the creator is actively seeking critique and improvement on the content flagged for critique.\nItems flagged for critique that the uploader did not create will have the flag removed.</p>\n<p>Abuse of this feature (e.g.\nusing it for advertising purposes, on items made for you, or to otherwise keep items on the front page) will result in the removal of certain site privileges.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> C.\nProhibited Upload Material <ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Offensive Content:</strong> Submissions should avoid expressing bigoted or hateful material (e.g.\nracist, sexist, homophobic, etc.) to the extent possible without compromising the artistic integrity of the piece.\nMaterial that appears intended for the sole purpose of provoking hostile responses is not permitted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Minors in Sexual/Mature Situations:</strong> Submissions and other uploaded content must not contain characters who are or are depicted as being under the age of eighteen present in sexual situations, whether or not they are directly involved.\nAdditionally, minors may not be depicted with unacceptable nudity.\n\"Depicted as being under the age of eighteen\" can mean one of two things: <ul>\n<li>The character is referred to or implied as being under 18, whether in a visual or written piece, or;</li>\n<li>The character in question has small child- or infant-like proportions (excepting stylized depictions of adults that incorporate childlike proportions, e.g.\n\u201cchibi\u201d).\nCanon is taken into consideration.\nhowever, if the character has the appearance of being under 18 or is not depicted \u201caged up\u201d, the submission may still be removed.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>Unacceptable nudity for the purposes of this article entails both of the following: <ul>\n<li>Genitals, buttocks, and/or mammaries with nipples are viewable.</li>\n<li>Not depicted using non-detailed nudity or cartoon nudity.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>Furthermore, photographs must not contain any improperly clothed minors regardless of the situation depicted.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Seizure-Inducing Images:</strong> Do not upload any avatars, banners, profile images, or submissions that feature rapidly flashing lights, colors, or rapid movement, as this may induce seizures in some users.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Avatars, Banners, and Profile Pictures:</strong> Do not upload an avatar, banner, or profile picture that is not suitable for all audiences, as such content is accessible to everyone.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Duplicates/Similar Content Posting:</strong> It is prohibited to upload any exact duplicates or over three (3) submissions of considerable similarity, with no discernible or apparent difference between them.\nSimilar submissions should be posted in collage format to save bandwidth and avoid flooding users\u2019 inboxes with large amounts of similar submissions.\nThis rule applies to character submissions and journals as well.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Character Generator Submissions:</strong> Content in a user\u2019s \"Submissions\" gallery created using a generator program for most or all of the content in a submission is not permissible.\nHowever, the use of a generator to create content in a user\u2019s \"Characters\" gallery is permissible, so long as the content complies with the rest of the Weasyl Guidelines.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Adoptables, Auction, and Raffle Reminders:</strong> It is acceptable to post reminder submissions, however any reminder may only be posted one time every 24 hours.\nThere is no limit on the amount of individual auctions a user can have open at one time.\nUploading a reminder, deleting it, and re-uploading it multiple times in 24 hours or less is considered a violation.\nIn addition, any submission that falls under this rule must be tagged with \"reminder\".</li>\n</ol> II.\nCategory Specific Rules A.\nVisual Art <ol>\n<li>Must not be improperly rotated, blurry, or show a portion of the scanner bed.</li>\n<li>Using pre-existing images and sprites for the purposes of a comic is allowed only with the use of stock images or with permission from the image creator.</li>\n<li>Art memes (such as questionnaires or \"draw in the blank\" submissions) are acceptable as long as the user completing them does so using original content that they created.\nImage macros (existing images to which a textual caption has been added) and (de)motivational posters are not permitted as submission uploads unless they contain imagery that was created by the user submitting them.</li>\n<li>Submissions that have been heavily referenced or contain material that does not belong to the submission's author (e.g free-to-use items such as stock images, or material for which permission has been granted for use) are permitted so long as the original sources are cited.\nHowever, stock images by themselves, with little or no original content, are not permitted.</li>\n<li>Submissions comprised primarily of words written in an image file are prohibited from visual art submissions, unless the arrangement of the text is important to the artistry of the piece.\nThese items should be composed as literary submissions or journal entries.</li>\n</ol> B.\nPhotography <ol>\n<li>Must not be excessively blurry, grainy, under- or overexposed (too dark or bright to discern anything), or rotated improperly, unless important to the artistry of the piece.</li>\n<li>Must not depict the use of illegal drugs, child abuse, animal abuse, human or animal injury or gore, bodily waste or fluids, or illegal acts or items.\n<ul>\n<li>Stage

Mature or Explicit categories (exact category depends on the content, as per the Ratings Guidelines).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Must not contain pornographic depictions of any sex acts.</li>\n<li>Must not feature exposed or clearly defined genitalia, or exposed mammaries with nipples or areolae, even if the image has been altered so as to obscure them.</li>\n<li>The presence of animal genitalia in photographs is permissible only if it is an incidental appearance and not related to the main focus of the image.</li>\n<li>Must not feature sex paraphernalia such as sex toys or gear.</li>\n<li>Must not be for the purpose of simply showing yourself, something that you own, or something you have stumbled across unless effort has been taken to render the subject in an artistic or educational manner.</li>\n<li>Must not focus on an electronic display in which the content could otherwise be captured with a screenshot.</li>\n</ol> C.\n3D Modeling <ol>\n<li>Submissions that are wholly comprised of content you made yourself are permissible, so long as the submissions also meet the rest of the criteria of the Community Guidelines and Ratings Guidelines.</li>\n<li>If a submission contains pre-existing 3D models or objects, at least one of the following conditions must be met: <ul>\n<li>The user must obtain permission from the original creator(s), unless the copyright has been waived.</li>\n<li>The user must have altered the model in some way as to be significantly different from the original, such as through reskinning or modelling the mesh further.</li>\n</ul> Regardless, the source of those items must be cited somewhere in the submission itself or its description, including stating which pre-existing materials have been added or modified.</li>\n</ol> D.\nScreenshots <ol>\n<li>Screenshots can be uploaded for one or more of the following three purposes: <ol>\n<li>Showing off a user interface for a shell, website, or program that you created.</li>\n<li>Displaying a 3D model or scene that you created or modified, as long as it complies with the rules laid out in II.C.\nabove.</li>\n<li>Showcasing a drawn-on screenshot from a creation of your own or another website, so long as the illustrations are for the purpose of criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research, and so long as they meet the visual art standard.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Screenshots uploaded for the purpose of view-acquiring contests are not permitted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Screenshots that are largely/completely comprised of content from a video

with character generators as well.</li>\n</ol> E.\nWriting <ol>\n<li>Writing must not contain excessive typographical or formatting errors, and submissions should be reviewed for spelling and grammatical errors before they are posted.\nAny submission where technical errors impede the work as a whole will be removed.</li>\n<li>Quotations from poetry, song lyrics, or other works are permitted only if the user has obtained permission from the original creator(s), unless copyright has been waived, or the usage complies with current U.S.\nfair use laws.</li>\n<li>The Literature

mind.</li>\n<li>Must not sample clips longer than 30 seconds.\nThe full length of the clip is considered, rather than the length of time it is looped for.</li>\n<li>Audio clips may not focus on the sounds of sexual activity, bodily waste or functions as the main component of the submission.</li>\n</ol> G.\nVideo <ol>\n<li>Video submissions must not be incredibly blurry, misaligned, overexposed,

"text": " Copyright Policy Copyright and Your Weasyl Experience <p>Weasyl respects the intellectual property and rights of all creative people across the world.\nWe require that our members do the same and ask that members help us in building an environment that facilitates members to create freely and without fear of copyright infringement.</p> Copyright Infringement <p>Simply put, copyright infringement occurs when you use someone else's creative work without first acquiring the proper permission to do so.\nFor example, these include (but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uploading to the internet content that is not yours without the original creator's permission</li>\n<li>Using a creative work commercially without express permission</li>\n<li>Copying a creative work in part or whole (this includes adapting a creative work across mediums)</li>\n<li>Incorporating a creative work into your own without sufficiently altering the work or providing original idea</li>\n</ul> Avoiding Copyright infringement <p>Creating in its entirety something on your own and through your own talents and imagination is the easiest way to avoid infringing on someone's copyright.\nSaid creation should be \"original\" in the sense that you yourself are responsible for the creative work without referencing or copying anyone else's work in part or whole.</p>\n<p>If you wish to use or have used the work of another person in your creation, be sure to acquire explicit permission and/or licensing prior to placing your work in a public medium.\nFailure to do so would result in Copyright Infringement.</p> Items Capable of Being Copyrighted <p>Nearly any and every creative work is considered copyright by default.\nThere does not need to be the presence of a copyright statement in order for something to be considered copyrighted.\nIf there is no written notice, you should assume the work is protected.</p>\n<p>Just because something is located in a public space or has been made publicly available does not mean that it falls under public domain or free for use.\nYou should only believe something to be public domain or free for use when it is explicitly stated as such.</p> Copyright Versus Trademarks <p>Copyrights and Trademarks are not the same thing.\nCopyrights apply to creations and creative works.\nTrademarks only apply to brand names, slogans, logos, and other monikers identifying a company, corporation, or entity.</p>\n<p>Copyrights offer protection to the owner against unauthorized use of their work.\nTrademarks offer protection to the owner against unauthorized use of their distinguishing items, specifically against things like false advertising, misrepresentation, and impersonation.</p>\n<p>Characters are considered an identifying item, much like a logo or name, and thus <em>cannot be copyrighted</em>.\nThey can only be trademarked.</p>\n<p>You do not need to officially register for a trademark or copyright in order to be given protection.\nhowever, officially registering a trademark or copyright grants the owner much greater legal protection.\nThis includes but is not limited to the right to sue in a federal court, presumed exclusivity of use, official notice to the public, and official public record.\nUnregistered trademarks and copyrights are subject to far greater burdens of evidence in order to be permissible in court.</p>\n<p>\n<sup>TM</sup> denotes an unregistered trademark.\n<sup>SM</sup> denotes an unregistered service mark (a trademark for items lacking a physical body, such as a sound byte).\n\u00ae denotes a registered trademark or service mark.\nPlease be aware that unauthorized use of \u00ae can result in penalties.\nIn order to use the \u00ae symbol, you must register your trademark with the appropriate regulating body (e.g., USPTO for the U.S.).</p>\n<p>\u00a9 denotes a copyright, unregistered or otherwise.\n<em>A work need not possess this symbol in order to be protected by copyright</em>.</p> Precautions <p>When dealing with copyrights, there are some common misconceptions.\nPlease be aware of the following items:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Regardless of how much or how little you use a particular work or material in your own creation, it is still considered to be copyrighted and thus requires the owner's permission to be used.\n</li>\n<li>Regardless of where you acquired the work, it again is considered copyrighted and requires permission.\n</li>\n<li>Crediting the proper owner does not absolve you of copyright infringement.\nPermission is still required.\nTo note, you should always credit the proper owner, even if you have obtained permission to use their work.\n</li>\n<li>Not using something commercially also does not make it free for use.\nPermission is still required.\n</li>\n<li>Even if others are using it without permission, it is still copyright infringement.\nPermission is still required.\n</li>\n<li>So long as the original work is recognizable, it is considered copyrighted, and thus permission is still required.\n</li>\n<li>While a character in a pose (as a whole) can be copyrighted, the character itself cannot.\nThe pose by itself cannot, unless it is referenced in such a way that it is immediately traceable to the original work from which is was derived.</li>\n<li>The original author of a piece of work retains all rights to the work unless these rights are explicitly sold, transfered, or otherwise relinquished.\nFor example, commissioning work from an artist does not give the commissioner rights to the art except in the instance where a prearranged and clearly defined agreement between the artist and commissioner has been established to the contrary or the artist decides to sell or surrender these rights after creation.</li>\n</ol> If You Commit Copyright Infringement <p>When Weasyl becomes cognizant of any submission that infringes upon the copyrights of another entity, we will immediately delete it.\nThis is a legal requirement that we willfully fulfill with all due haste.\nYou will not receive any warning nor will you receive any opportunity to rectify the situation.\nAny copyright owner following the procedures in this Copyright Policy can require Weasyl to remove his or her copyrighted content.\nIf your work has been removed for copyright infringement, you may still be liable for damages should the owner decide to sue.</p>\n<p>If you believe that a submission on Weasyl infringes upon your copyright you may either report the submission using our internal reporting system or send us a copyright notice via email.</p>\n<p>If you are found to repeatedly upload infringing content, your account will banned.\nIf you are found to be deliberately misrepresenting the copyright work of another as your own, you will be banned immediately.</p>\n<p>If you believe that one of your submissions was removed in error, you may contact Weasyl or file a Counter-Notice.</p> Fair Use <p>\"Fair Use\" is the idea that some public and private uses of copyrighted works should not require the permission of a copyright owner.\nSuch circumstances are rare, difficult to analyze under the law, and often require the help of expert legal advice.\nWe heavily recommend you talk to your own lawyer if you want to know more about fair use as it relates to your own work.\nIf it ends up that your use isn't considered fair use, you may be liable for very serious monetary damages.</p>\n<p>To learn more about fair use please go here, here, and here, or speak directly to your lawyer.</p> Claims Regarding Copyright Infringement <p>Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512), Weasyl has implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed infringements.\nWeasyl has also designated an agent to receive notices of claimed copyright infringements.\nTo file a copyright infringement notification with Weasyl, the copyright owner or an agent acting on his or her behalf will need to send a written communication that includes the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>\n<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.\nIn this regard, please provide URLs when you identify the location of the material.</li>\n<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.</li>\n<li>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>\n<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In some circumstances, in order to notify the subscriber, account holder or host who provided the allegedly infringing content to which Weasyl has disabled access, Weasyl may forward a copy of a valid Notice including name and email address to the subscriber or account holder, or may forward a copy of a valid Notice (with personally identifiable information removed) to Chilling Effects (https://www.chillingeffects.org) for publication.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Under Section 512(f) of the DCMA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.\nConsult your legal counsel or see Section 512(c)(3) of 17 U.S.C.\nto clarify or confirm the requirements of the notice.</strong>\n</p> Counter-Notification <p>If you believe that a notice of copyright infringement has been improperly submitted against you, you may submit a Counter-Notice, pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\nYou may complete the Counter-Notice Regarding Claim of Copyright Infringement form, or otherwise provide a written communication which contains:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your physical or electronic signature </li>\n<li>Identification of the material removed or to which access has been disabled </li>\n<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that removal or disablement of the material was a mistake or that the material was misidentified.\n</li>\n<li>Your name and telephone number, and a statement that you consent with the jurisdiction of the Federal District court (i) in the judicial district where your address is located if the address is in the United States, or (ii) for any judicial district for which Weasyl may be found, if your address is located outside the United States, and that you will accept service of process from the Complainant submitting the notice or his/her authorized agent.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.</strong>\n</p> Designated Copyright Agent <p>Weasyl's Agent for Notice of claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement can be reached
