manage your email accounts by offering you a tool that cleans your mailbox and automatically deletes your newsletters.\nThis document concerns the use of Cleanfox only and cannot have the purpose or effect of restricting or substituting other existing documents such as the user data protection policy and the cookie policy.\nThe fact that Cleanfox is free of charge depends on our ability to finance the service independently of any payment requested from users.\nThis means that its business model is based on the creation, from transactional data recovered from your email account, of anonymised data which we offer for sale for statistical purposes to economic operators.\nto enable them to improve their products and services and refine their market knowledge.\nFoxintelligence undertakes not to disclose to the latter any personal data that relates to you and informs you that it does not use your personal data for targeted advertising purposes.\n</p> 2.\nPURPOSE <p> The purpose of these general terms of use is to inform you about how Cleanfox works, the rules to be obeyed, and the guarantees that you benefit from when using it.\nThese general terms create a mechanism whereby the following rights granted to each party are offset against each other: - the right for the user to benefit from the email account cleaning service free of charge, - the right for Foxintelligence to extract data in transactional emails received by the user in order to offer anonymised data for statistical purposes for sale.\n</p> 3.\nDEFINITIONS <p> The following definitions are intended to aid your understanding of these general terms: </p>\n<p> - \u00ab Cleanfox \u00bb: a service made available free of charge to the user by Foxintelligence via the Web, IOS, Huawei or Android which offers him/her an automatic tool that deletes newsletters received in his/her email account(s).\n</p>\n<p> - \u00ab User \u00bb: means any Internet user who has installed Cleanfox and

prospecting message (newsletter) or provide help of any kind (support email) to the user, from which data is extracted by Foxintelligence for the purposes of creating anonymised data for statistical purposes.\n</p> 4.\nDURATION <p> These general terms shall enter into force from the time when they are accepted by the User upon creation of his/her Cleanfox account and until it is finally closed.\n</p> 5.\nENFORCEABILITY <p> These general terms shall be enforceable upon acceptance by the user when downloading the Cleanfox service and signing up for it.\nAny registration with Cleanfox implies prior and unconditional acceptance of these general terms, which you are invited to read carefully.\nIf you do not agree to them, we request that you delete your Cleanfox account.\nPlease note that the applicable general terms are always the latest version accessible via Cleanfox and that you cannot enforce any previous general terms of use against us.\nIf you are a minor, you shall be regarded as having received permission from your parents or any person holding parental authority before you installed Cleanfox.\n</p> 6.\nSIGNING UP FOR CLEANFOX <p>To use Cleanfox, you must first sign up for the service on the website or www.cleanfox.io or the application Cleanfox with a valid personal email address.\nThe account creation process involves the following stages:</p>\n<p>- Stage 1: you fill in your email address.\nOnly email addresses provided on a personal basis by ordinary email services (Gmail, Live, Hotmail, Outlook, iCloud, Orange, Yahoo, MSN, etc.) will be recognised, excluding addresses that include professional domains.</p>\n<p>- Stage 2: you must read and agree to these general terms and the Cleanfox user data protection policy and agree to give Foxintelligence access to your emails and so that you can benefit from the Cleanfox service.\n(We use only your transactional and promotional emails and never any personal email).\nBy validating the registration, you confirm the synchronisation of Cleanfox with your email address.</p>\n<p>- Stage 3: for Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, Live, MSN, Yahoo, Icloud.\nfor other email providers, go directly to stage 6: to make sure that it is really you who has connected to Cleanfox, you must go through the two-step authentication process, which increases the security of the connexion to your account.</p>\n<p>For Gmail, Yahoo, Icloud: you will receive a code sent to your mobile phone, by a text message, a call or by a notification via the Android system or the Gmail app for iPhone.</p>\n<p>For Hotmail, Outlook, Live, MSN?: your will receive a code by email to a secondary address, by text message or a notification on your smartphone via the application Microsoft Authenticator.\nWe will display a tailored help page to you in order to help you to complete this stage.</p>\n<p>- Stage 4: for Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, Live, MSN, Yahoo, Icloud.\nfor other email providers, go directly to stage 6: you must create an application password, i.e.\na single-use password generated by your email provider for your first login to Cleanfox.\nOn the app, you can either choose a manual configuration (you do all the steps yourself) or a automatic configuration (Cleanfox does it for you).</p>\n<p>- Stage 5: only for Gmail: you must activate the IMAP protocol from your email account.\nWe will display a tailored help page to you in order to help you to complete this stage.\nAs on the prior stage, you can either choose a manual or automatic configuration.</p>\n<p>- Stage 6: For Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, Live, MSN, Yahoo, Icloud, you must log-in with the application password created on stage 4.\nFor other email providers, you must log-in with your usual password.</p>\n<p>- Stage 7: now that your registration is complete, Cleanfox starts synchronising your email account in order to isolate newsletters as per the procedure set out hereinafter.\nBecause the purpose of our service is to avoid receiving unwanted emails, we have decided not to send you an email confirming that you have installed Cleanfox.</p>\n<p>You may add or delete an email account at any time using the functionality provided for this purpose.\nAdding email accounts will enable you to clean them simultaneously using the same user registration.</p> 7.\nLOGIN DETAILS <p> To sign up for Cleanfox, you identify yourself with your email address and, depending on which email service you use, either the password associated with your email account or the automatically-generated single-use application password.\nYou must check that these login details, i.e.\nyour email address and password where the latter is required, are correct, up to date and complete, and carefully obey the rules laid down by your email service in terms of your selection and updating of login details.\nAny use of Cleanfox with your account will be attributed to you.\nThis means that you have sole responsibility for keeping and maintaining the confidentiality of your login details and the acts and conduct of any person who uses your account, even without your knowledge.\nTherefore, we cannot be held liable for any permanent deletion of newsletters from your account or in the event of any unlawful or fraudulent use of Cleanfox.\n</p> 8.\nEMAIL ACCOUNT CLEANING FUNCTION <p> The email account cleaning service consists of Cleanfox firstly identifying your received newsletters by means of tools that target the subjects and addresses of emails in order to make a full list of them.\nSecondly, Cleanfox presents this list of newsletters to you and you may then choose, for each of them, to carry out one of the following actions: </p>\n<p> - keep it in your inbox.\n</p>\n<p> - delete it, which means keeping the subscription to the newsletter for the future and putting newsletters received so far in the trash can.\n</p>\n<p> - delete it and activate automatic deletion of all newsletters sent subsequently by the same sender.\n</p>\n<p> Cleanfox never deletes newsletters permanently, they are moved to the trash can, which enables the user to delete them manually or automatically according to his/her email account settings.\n</p> 9.\nSTATISTICS CREATION FUNCTION <p> In exchange for the free provision of the email cleaning service, we use the transactional data extracted from your email account to produce anonymised data for statistical purposes for various economic operators.\nFirstly, we use techniques to filter subjects and email delivery addresses to identify transactional emails, which excludes any personal communication that you have received.\nOnce they have been identified, we use a data extraction tool which enables us to extract the relevant transactional data from each of them, i.e.\nthe data that classifies the transaction.\nThis raw data is then enriched with artificial intelligence techniques which enable us to obtain further information about purchases made, but they cannot have the purpose or effect of identifying you in any way, and Foxintelligence uses tested pseudonymisation techniques at this stage.\nThis structured data is used to draw up statistical study reports for various economic operators.\nAt this stage, data is fully anonymised and it is therefore impossible for you to be identified again.\n</p> 10.\nLACK OF ACCESS TO YOUR EMAIL <p> We access your email account for the sole purposes of identifying newsletters to enable you to delete them on the one hand, and identifying your transactional emails in order to extract from them the data that enables us to produce statistics on the other hand.\nIn the context of this access, we guarantee to you that our teams do not go through your email accounts freely.\nOn the contrary, we use tools to filter email subjects and delivery addresses which enable us to identify transactional emails so that we can then, without accessing them as such, extract from them the relevant data giving details of the transaction performed.\nWe are therefore able to guarantee that we respect the confidentiality of correspondence: firstly, we do not access any personal email that concerns you, and secondly, we do not extract any data from such emails.\nOn a residual and occasional basis, a limited part of our teams may access your transactional emails in order to develop and improve our tools which filter emails and extract relevant transactional data.\n</p> 11.\nSTATISTICS SECTION <p> In the \u00ab Statistics \u00bb section which can be accessed from your Cleanfox account, you can view statistics concerning the number of emails deleted and newsletters you decided to automatically delete and the number of online purchases that you have made.\n</p> 12.\nSUSPENSION AND CLOSURE OF ACCOUNT <p> You can close your account at any time by following the procedure stated in the FAQ accessible on the website www.cleanfox.io.\nIn your account settings, you should select the email address with which you created your Cleanfox account and click on \u00ab Delete this email account \u00bb.\nClosure of your account for any reason ends the synchronisation between your email account and Cleanfox and loss of the benefit of the service offered through it.\nIf it identifies a proven breach by you of these general terms, Foxintelligence reserves the right to suspend your account at any time, temporarily or permanently, without giving notice or formal notice of default.\n</p> 13.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY <p> Installing and using Cleanfox does not result in any transfer of any kind to the user of intellectual property rights to Cleanfox or its content.\n</p>\n<p> The Cleanfox service and all of its components, including trademarks, drawings, models, images, text, photos, logos, software, programs, graphic charters, domain names, icons, slogans, designs or any other information or medium displayed or named on Cleanfox, without this list being exhaustive, are the exclusive property of Foxintelligence and are protected by the copyright, trademark, patent and any other intellectual or industrial property right that they are recognised as having under current laws.\nIn all cases, we grant you a simple worldwide right to use Cleanfox for personal purposes for a period limited to the period for which Cleanfox is installed on your terminal, which will be revoked when you stop using it.\n</p>\n<p> The user shall therefore refrain from any conduct or act which may directly or indirectly infringe Foxintelligence's intellectual property rights.\n</p>\n<p> The user shall therefore refrain strictly from reproducing, representing, using, adapting, altering, reconstructing, modifying, translating, offering for sale, performing or obtaining unauthorised access to all or part of Cleanfox and/or the aforementioned components without having obtained our explicit prior authorisation.\n</p>\n<p> The user acknowledges that any use of the aforementioned components which is contrary to these general terms would constitute an infringement which is a criminal offence under the Intellectual Property Code.\nFoxintelligence reserves the right to take legal action against any person who fails to comply with this prohibition.\n</p> 14.\nSECURITY <p> Foxintelligence shall make its best efforts, in accordance with industry practices, to make Cleanfox secure and protect it from any fraudulent intrusion or cyberattack whatsoever, and the protection and security measures implemented are of course appropriate to address the risks affecting your data and privacy.\nHowever, in view of the exponential nature of technological advances, you acknowledge that Cleanfox is not immune to unforeseeable events affecting the Internet and its vulnerabilities and that no service is infallible.\n</p>\n<p> If a security breach is detected, we may, at our sole discretion and without notice, suspend Cleanfox in whole or in part for an indefinite period or take any measure necessary to protect your data and the service.\nYou are invited to inform us by email at the address contact@cleanfox.io of any information that may help us to prevent or reduce the potential risks of security breaches affecting Cleanfox and your data.\n</p> 15.\nPERSONAL DATA <p> Foxintelligence acts in accordance with personal data protection regulations, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation, the updated French Data Processing and Freedoms Act, and the recommendations of EDPB.\nFor more information about how your data is processed, you can refer to the personal data protection policy for users of Cleanfox by

of these cookies and the settings options for them, you can refer to our cookie policy by clicking here.\n</p> 17.\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY <p> In its provision of Cleanfox, Foxintelligence is subject to a best-endeavours obligation.\nYou acknowledge that you are the sole and only person with responsibility for your use of Cleanfox.\n</p>\n<p> You declare that you know and accept the characteristics and limitations of the Internet, operating systems and electronic communication networks and acknowledge that Cleanfox is subject to the unforeseeable events that are associated with them and the proper operation of your terminal and third-party websites and services of newsletter senders.\n</p>\n<p> You also acknowledge that because Cleanfox relies on access to your email account, the Cleanfox service would be unable to operate if this access became impossible for any reason.\nHowever, we cannot be liable for any impossibility of accessing or malfunctioning of your email account, you would have to go back to your email service provider.\n</p>\n<p> We use the best-performing tools to identify the newsletters stored in your email account, but in view of technological advances and the wide range of ways in which senders of emails name them, we cannot be held responsible for errors in identifying a newsletter.\nWe therefore invite you to check the contents of your inbox and your trash can regularly.\n</p>\n<p> In accordance with industry practices, we make our best efforts to provide a high-quality, functional and pleasant service, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, subject to force majeure events, possible breakdowns or maintenance interventions necessary for the proper running of the service.\n</p>\n<p> Consequently, we give no guarantee of continuity in relation to the use of Cleanfox and we cannot be held liable for failures, slowdowns, interruptions or saturation of the Internet connection or, in general, unavailability of the service, for any reason whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p> Cleanfox is provided free of charge excluding the cost of an Internet subscription from a telephony operator.\nUnder no circumstances can we be held liable for any additional costs resulting from the use of the service, for any reason whatsoever.\n</p> 18.\nAGREEMENT IN RELATION TO PROOF <p> Agreements, clicks or other evidence of your activity and decisions taken in your Cleanfox account shall be kept in reasonable conditions of security and shall therefore be regarded as proof of communications between us.\nAs such, this provision must be regarded as an agreement in relation to proof.\n</p> 19.\nNO WAIVER <p> If we do not take action in relation to a breach by you, this cannot be construed for the future as a waiver by us of our right to take action to obtain compensation for the breach.\n</p> 20.\nNULLITY <p> If one or more provisions of these general terms is/are found to be void or declared as such pursuant to a law or regulation or as a result of a decision by a court with jurisdiction which has become final, the other provisions shall retain all of their force and effect.\n</p> 21.\nUPDATES TO THE GENERAL TERMS <p> We reserve the right to amend these general terms at any time so that they take account of improvements to Cleanfox, the addition of new functionalities or any updates justified by any regulatory changes.\n</p>\n<p> No prior notice of updates to the general terms which have no effect on your rights and obligations will be given, you may read the applicable version in Cleanfox.\n</p>\n<p> If an update to the general terms entails a change in your rights and obligations, a new version of the general terms will be communicated to you, and you will be required to agree to it within thirty (30) days after they are posted online.\nIn order to do this, you must either continue to use the service or stop using it, and if you do not deregister for the service after the new general terms are communicated, they will be deemed to have been accepted.\n</p> 22.\nAPPLICABLE LAW AND COURT WITH JURISDICTION <p> These general terms are governed by French law.\nThe same applies to substantive and procedural rules, regardless of the places where fundamental or subsidiary obligations are performed.\nThe French courts have jurisdiction to consider any dispute in connection with these general terms for the use of Cleanfox.\n</p> 23.\nCONTACT DETAILS <p> For any queries with regard to the use of Cleanfox, you may contact Foxintelligence at the following address:

Foxintelligence publishes Cleanfox, a free service which makes it easier for you to manage your email accounts by offering you a tool that cleans your mailbox and automatically deletes your newsletters.\n</p>\n<p> In exchange for this free service, the transactional data extracted from the email accounts of users enables us to offer anonymised data to various third parties (businesses, non-profit organizations, schools, and universities) so that they can improve their products and services and refine their market knowledge.\n</p>\n<p> We guarantee to you in this regard that we do not disclose to these third parties any personal data that relates to you, and the anonymisation tools that we use are tested and do not enable you to be identified subsequently in any way.\nYou are also informed that we do not use any of your data for targeted advertising purposes.\nTo enable Cleanfox to work properly, we must carry out some processing of its users' personal data.\nWe therefore act as a data controller, in that we determine the means and purposes of the processing of your data.\n</p>\n<p> As such, we undertake to comply with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nArticle 12 also requires us to inform you of the characteristics of the processing that we carry out with your data and the rights that you have in relation to it.\n</p> 2.\nPURPOSE <p> The purpose of this Cleanfox user data protection policy is to fulfill our obligation to be transparent and provide information by making you aware of all of the information required by the GDPR.\n</p> 3.\nRESPECT FOR YOUR PRIVACY <p> We access your email account for the sole purposes of identifying newsletters so that you can delete them on the one hand, and identifying your transactional emails in order to extract the data that enables us to offer anonymized data for statistical, research, investment, or educational purposes.\n</p>\n<p> Under no circumstances do we access the contents of your personal emails.\nWith regard to transactional emails, we extract data in them without accessing them, unless we update our filtering and data extraction tools, in which case only a limited part of our teams may access these emails.\n</p>\n<p> Please also note that we anonymise all personal data that relates to you to offer anonymized data for statistical research, investment or educational purposes for sale to various third parties (businesses, non-profit organizations, schools and universities).\n</p>\n<p> Since anonymisation is an irreversible process that prevents any subsequent identification, anonymised data is no longer regarded as personal data.\n</p> 4.\nDATA PROCESSED <p> The data concerning you that we may process is as follows: </p>\n<p> - identity and identification (surname, first name, date of birth, automatically generated ID, referral code associated with each user), </p>\n<p> - contact details (email address(es) provided in order to create the Cleanfox account and to be cleaned) </p>\n<p> - transactional data concerning your online-purchases (information about the item(s) concerned, payment type, delivery address, billing address if different, order number, user's consumption history) </p>\n<p> - technical data (identification data, connection data, acceptance data and, where applicable, location data).\n</p> 5.\nORIGIN OF DATA <p> We collect your data from: </p>\n<p> - data that you provide to us directly when you create your Cleanfox account, </p>\n<p> - data generated automatically from our services in order to identify you and make your access to Cleanfox secure (application password, user ID) </p>\n<p> - enriched data generated from our services by means of machine learning, data science and crawling tools in order to obtain additional information about your buyer profile (sex, town) and transactions carried out, not all enriched data is personal as not all of it can identify you or make you identifiable.\n</p> 6.\nLEGAL BASIS <p> The legal basis of the processing carried out by Foxintelligence under this policy is to fulfill the general terms of use of Cleanfox, which were agreed to by the user when creating his/her Cleanfox account.\n</p> 7.\nPURPOSES <p> We process your personal data for the following purposes: </p>\n<p> - managing your registration with Cleanfox, </p>\n<p> - providing the cleaning service for your email accounts, </p>\n<p> - managing the relationship and interactions with you, </p>\n<p> - dealing with requests to add or delete an email account associated with Cleanfox, </p>\n<p> - dealing with your requests to delete your Cleanfox account, </p>\n<p> - improving our services and audience measurements and, where applicable, satisfaction surveys, </p>\n<p> - producing anonymised data which are offered for sale to third parties for statistical, research, investment or educational purposes </p> 8.\nRECIPIENTS <p> The GDPR defines data recipients as individuals or corporations to whom/which personal data is communicated, regardless of whether they are a data controller or processor.\n</p>\n<p> In this regard, recipients of your data, who have our permission or legal authority to access it, can be internal or external: </p>\n<p> - internal recipients are members of our staff who are authorised to process your data according to their respective skills.\n</p>\n<p> - external recipients are our processors (e.g.\ndata host), or authorised services responsible for auditing (auditors), the civil service, the judicial authorities and law officers as part of their role, where appropriate.\n</p> 9.\nSTORAGE PERIOD <p> Your data is processed for a limited period which we decide in the light of the legal and contractual restrictions on us and, failing this, according to our needs.\n</p>\n<p> We apply the following storage periods: </p>\n<p> - if your account is deleted: immediate deletion of your data.\n</p>\n<p> - if you are inactive without deleting your account: 3 years from the most recent activity in your account or the most recent contact with you.\n</p> 10.\nYOUR RIGHTS <p> You have the following rights with regard to your personal data: </p>\n<p> - a right to ask us to confirm that data which concerns you is being processed, to access this data and to request a copy of it (right to access and copy).\n</p>\n<p> - a right to have any data concerning you which is inaccurate or obsolete corrected (right of rectification).\n</p>\n<p> - a right to ask for your data to be erased when you no longer wish to use Cleanfox (right to erasure).\n</p>\n<p> - a right to receive data concerning you which you have communicated to us in a structured, widely-used and machine-readable format (right to portability).\n</p>\n<p> - a right to give instructions in relation to the processing of your data if you die (post-mortem right).\n</p>\n<p> However, you are informed that you do not have a right to restrict or object to the processing of your data as the requirements for these rights to be exercised as laid down in the applicable regulations are not met in this case.\n</p>\n<p> The right to erasure is exercised automatically when you delete your Cleanfox account, as this results in immediate and automatic deletion of your personal data, unless you instruct otherwise.\n</p>\n<p> With regard to the right to data portability, you have a functionality in Cleanfox which enables you to exercise it and recover all of the data that you provided to us when you signed up for Cleanfox.\n</p>\n<p> Lastly, in the \u00b0\u221eSettings\u00b0\u00b1 section of your Cleanfox account, we give you a right to opt out of being among the group of users whose transactional data we use to produce anonymised data for statistical, research, investment or educational purposes for our clients.\n</p>\n<p> The other aforementioned rights must be exercised exclusively by you in writing, either by email to contact@cleanfox.io or by mail to the address Foxintelligence 1 rue de Metz 75010 Paris.\n</p>\n<p> If we have any doubts about your identity, we reserve the right to ask you to provide proof of your identity, which will be deleted immediately after your identity has been verified.\n</p> 11.\nPROCESSING <p> The GDPR defines a processor as any individual or corporation who/which processes personal data on a data controller's behalf.\n</p>\n<p> If we decide to enlist any processor of our choice to process your data, we will ensure that the latter honours his/her/its obligations under the GDPR and will undertake to sign a written contract with him/her/it which will require him/her/it to perform the same obligations that we fulfil ourselves in relation to data protection.\nWe also reserve the right to carry out an audit of our processors in order to ensure that they are fulfilling their obligations.\n</p> 12.\nSECURITY <p> We take the technical and organisational measures that we deem appropriate to combat unauthorised destruction, loss, alteration or disclosure of personal data in an accidental or unlawful manner.\n</p>\n<p> These measures include: </p>\n<p> - managing permissions and restrictions of data access rights, </p>\n<p> - using secure identification processes such as the application password to synchronise the user's email account and Cleanfox, </p>\n<p> - using tested data pseudonymisation and anonymisation techniques.\nAnonymisation is mandatory prior to any communication of data for statistical, research, investment or educational purposes to various third parties (businesses, non-profit organizations, schools and universities) </p>\n<p> - implementing back-up measures, </p>\n<p> - implementing encryption measures (private keys), </p>\n<p> - implementing traceability measures for each database.\n</p>\n<p> If a processor is used, we undertake to make him/her/it contractually subject to security guarantees through appropriate technical and organisational measures.\n</p> 13.\nDATA BREACH <p> In the event of a data breach, we undertake to report it to EDPB in the manner stipulated by the GDPR.\n</p>\n<p> If the breach poses a high risk to you, we undertake to warn you about it if you are affected and to give you the necessary information and recommendations.\n</p> 14.\nDATA PROTECTION OFFICER <p> We have appointed a responsible for data protection, Mr Louis BALLADUR, whom you may contact at the following address for any queries concerning your data:
