of others and follows the requirements set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) and other applicable laws.\nIt is Mushroom\u2019s policy to terminate membership privileges of any Registered User who repeatedly infringes copyright upon prompt notification to Mushroom by the copyright owner or the copyright owner\u2019s legal agent.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, if you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Services in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide our Copyright Agent with the following information: (a) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest.\n(b) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed.\n(c) a description of the location on the Services of the material that you claim is infringing, such as a URL.\n(d) your address, telephone number and email address.\n(e) a written statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.\nand (f) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner\u2019s behalf.\nContact information for Mushroom\u2019s Copyright Agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement is as follows:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Copyright Manager</p>\n<p>The Base Holding Company</p>\n<p>3470 Middlefield Road</p>\n<p>Palo Alto, &nbsp;CA &nbsp;94306</p>\n<p>Phone: 2035702236</p>\n<p>Email: dmca@mushroom.gg</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mushroom\u2019s Actions Upon Receipt of Notifications of Claimed Infringement.\nIf Mushroom receives a complete notification from a rights holder or someone acting on their behalf claiming that content on a channel infringes the rights holder\u2019s copyright, Mushroom generally notifies the applicable Registered User.\nAt the same time, we will generally remove or disable access to recorded or other content containing the claimed infringing material.\nWe may suspend an Account if the claimed infringement is continuing at the time we receive the rights holder\u2019s notification.</li>\n<li>Mushroom\u2019s Actions Upon Receipt of Counter-Notifications.\nIf Mushroom receives a complete counter-notification from the applicable Registered User, Mushroom generally notifies the claimant who submitted the original notification.\nAt the same time, we may restore recorded content containing the claimed infringing material.\nDisputed notifications generally will not qualify for a strike under our Repeat Infringer Policy (discussed in more detail below), unless and until the dispute has been resolved by the applicable Registered User and the rights holder.\nPlease note that Mushroom may not be able to reinstate certain material or access to it due to factors such as the passage of time or the format in which the material was broadcast or stored.</li>\n<li>Mushroom\u2019s Actions Upon Receipt of Retractions.\nIf Mushroom receives a retraction from a rights holder or someone acting on their behalf, we may restore recorded content containing the claimed infringing material and the disputed notification will not qualify for a strike under our Repeat Infringer Policy (as provided by Section 11.7 (Repeat Infringer Policy)).\nPlease note that Mushroom may not be able to reinstate certain material or access to it due to factors such as the passage of time or the format in which the material was broadcast or stored.</li>\n<li>How to Submit a Counter-Notification.\nIf you are a Registered User and a notification of claimed infringement has been submitted against Your Content, we encourage you to review the details we have provided and consider your options.\nIf you believe that the notification, and any action Mushroom has taken as a result, was sent due to a mistake (for example, you believe your actions qualify as fair use under U.S.\nlaw) or misidentification, then you may send us a counter-notification.\nTo send a counter-notification, please provide all of the following information: (a) URL(s) where the material that was the subject of the notification of claimed infringement appeared before it was identified, removed, or access to it was disabled.\n(b) name of the claimant who submitted the notification.\n(c) your Mushroom username, if any.\n(d) your full legal name.\n(e) your email address.\n(f) your full postal address.\n(g) your phone number.\nand (h) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you have a good faith belief that the material identified in the notification was identified, removed, and/or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification.\nYou also have the option to explain why you believe there was a mistake or misidentification.\nCounter-notifications that include all of the information above should be sent to Mushroom\u2019s Copyright Agent as identified in Section 11.1 (Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement).\nKeep in mind that failure to provide this information could result in Mushroom being unable to take action in response to your counter-notification.</li>\n<li>How to Submit a Retraction.\nIf you are a Registered User who has received a notification of claimed infringement, you can seek a retraction by reaching out to the rights holder or agent who sent the notification directly.\nMushroom will honor retractions of notifications from the party that originally submitted the notifications.\nIf you are a rights holder or agent who submitted a notification that you wish to retract, please contact Mushroom\u2019s Copyright Agent as identified in Section 11.1 (Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement) with the following information: (a) the date of your original notification.\n(b) the copyrighted work(s) allegedly infringed.\n(c) the URL(s) where the allegedly infringing material could be found.\nand (d) a signature.</li>\n<li>Repeat Infringer Policy.\nMushroom will terminate a Registered User\u2019s access to the Services if such Registered User is determined by Mushroom to be a \u201crepeat infringer\u201d of copyrighted works on the Services.\nUnder our policy, a Registered User will be considered a repeat infringer if they accrue three copyright strikes.\nFurthermore, we may in appropriate cases and at our sole discretion, limit access to the Services and/or terminate the Accounts of any Registered User who blatantly and egregiously infringes the intellectual property rights of others, whether or not repeat infringement has occurred.\nRegistered Users generally earn a strike when Mushroom receives a complete notification of infringement and does not receive a complete counter-notification regarding the alleged infringement or a retraction of the notification.\nStrikes are not permanent, but rather are associated with an Account for enough time for Mushroom to determine whether the Registered User is engaging in repeated infringement such that termination is necessary under this policy.\nWhen determining whether Registered Users are repeat infringers under this policy, we take into consideration complete notifications of claimed infringement from rights holders, complete counter-notifications from Registered Users, retractions from rights holders, and other relevant factors and circumstances.\nMushroom may also ask the complainant and/or Registered User for more information where we think it\u2019s necessary to fairly apply our Repeat Infringer Policy.\nIf a relevant court rules that a Registered User is an \u201cinfringer\u201d or \u201crepeat infringer\u201d on Mushroom, we will take that ruling as conclusive under our Repeat Infringer Policy.\nTo provide judicial determinations showing that a Registered User is an infringer, or a repeat infringer, on the Services, please forward it to our Mushroom\u2019s Copyright Agent as identified in Section 11.1 (Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement) with \u201ccourt ruling regarding infringer/repeat infringer\u201d in the subject line.\nMushroom personnel will review the submission and may contact the complainant and/or Registered User to verify the court ruling and understand its scope.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>MONITORING AND ENFORCEMENT.\nMushroom reserves the right to:&nbsp;(a) remove or refuse to post any of Your Content for any or no reason in our sole discretion.\n(b) take any action with respect to any of your Content that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such Content violates the Agreement, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or could create liability for Mushroom.\n(c) take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Services.\nand/or (d) terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Services for any or no reason, including without limitation, any violation of this Agreement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If Mushroom becomes aware of any possible violations by you of the Agreement, Mushroom reserves the right to investigate such violations.\nIf, as a result of the investigation, Mushroom believes that criminal activity has occurred, Mushroom reserves the right to refer the matter to, and to cooperate with, any and all applicable legal authorities.\nMushroom is entitled, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, to disclose any information or materials on or in the Services, including Your Content, in Mushroom\u2019s possession in connection with your use of the Services, to (i) comply with applicable laws, legal process, or governmental request.\n(ii) enforce the Agreement, (iii) respond to any claims that Your Content violates the rights of third parties, (iv) respond to your requests for customer service, or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Mushroom, its Registered Users or the public, and all enforcement or other government officials, as Mushroom in its sole discretion believes to be

access, the Services or any other Mushroom community, is discontinued by Mushroom due to your violation of any portion of the Agreement or for conduct otherwise inappropriate for the community, then you agree that you shall not attempt to re-register with or access the Services or any Mushroom community through use of a different email address or otherwise.\nIn the event that you violate the immediately preceding sentence, Mushroom reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately take any or all of the actions set forth herein without any notice or warning to you.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>INTERNATIONAL USERS.&nbsp;The Services can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to Services and Content that are not available in your country.\nThese references do not imply that Mushroom intends to announce such Services or Content in your country.\nThe Services are controlled and offered by Mushroom from its facilities in the United States of America.\nMushroom makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations.\nThose who access or use the Services from other countries do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.</li>\n<li>DISPUTE RESOLUTION.\nPlease read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) carefully.\nIt requires U.S.\nusers to arbitrate disputes with Mushroom and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp;You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any products sold or distributed through the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with Mushroom, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (a) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify, and (b) you or Mushroom may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.\nThis Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.\n</li>\n<li>Arbitration Rules and Forum.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\nTo begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to our registered agent, Corporation Service Company, 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.\nDisputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys\u2019 fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS\u2019s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.\nall other disputes shall be subject to JAMS\u2019s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.\nJAMS\u2019s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.\nIf JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.\nIf the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS\u2019s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Mushroom will pay them for you.\nIn addition, Mushroom will reimburse all such JAMS\u2019s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Authority of Arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator shall have exclusive

Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Mushroom.\nThe arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant

applicable law, the arbitral forum\u2019s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.\n</li>\n<li>Waiver of Jury Trial.\nYOU AND MUSHROOM HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.\nYou and Mushroom are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 15.1 (Applicability of Arbitration Agreement) above.\nAn arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.\nHowever, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.\n</li>\n<li>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.\nALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this Section\u2019s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California.\nAll other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.\n</li>\n<li>30-Day Right to Opt

have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.\nOpting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</li>\n<li>Severability.\nExcept as provided in Section 15.5 (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</li>\n<li>Survival of Agreement.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Mushroom.</li>\n<li>Modification.&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Mushroom makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Mushroom at the

Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</li>\n<li>Severability.\nIf any portion of the Agreement is held invalid or
