you are required to open a Tenant.\nIn order to do that you must complete the registration process by providing us with current, complete and accurate information as prompted by the applicable

any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security.\nPerimeter 81 will not be liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge.\nHowever, you could be held liable for losses incurred by Perimeter 81 or another party due to someone else using your account or password.\nYou may not use

yearly basis (the \u201cSubscription Plan\u201d).\nThe price for each respective Subscription Plan is based on the length and features of such Subscription Plan (the \u201cPrice\u201d).\nThe Subscription Plans and the applicable Price thereof are subject to change from time to time by Perimeter 81, without liability to Perimeter 81 or any prior notice required.\nAny additional and/or future services may not be included in the Price, at Perimeter 81\u2019s sole discretion.</p>\n<p>The Subscription Plan Term will begin at the moment of cleared payment and end at the end of the Billing Cycle of the Subscription Plan.\nAny reversal of payment will result in the immediate termination of the Subscription Plan Term and void any credits and/or discounts and/or any commitments provided by Perimeter 81.</p>\n4.4 Means of Payment:\n<p>Once you shall choose your Subscription Plan as above, and in consideration thereof, you shall be required to choose a method for payment from any of several third-parties payment processors that are external to our Site (such as payment via credit card, ACH, or others) (the \u201cThird Party Payment Processors\u201d).\nAll payments are

Processors of your choosing.</p>\n4.5 Tax\n<p>It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make, and it is your responsibility to collect, report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.\nPerimeter 81 is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction.\nSales tax, Value Added Tax and other taxes may be added to your Subscription Plan payments to the extent applicable (as determined by Perimeter 81).</p>\n<p>In the event that you are required to deduct or withhold taxes of any kind from payments you make pursuant to a Subscription Plan, such withheld amount shall be grossed up and incurred solely by you, and the amount paid by you to the Company on account of your Subscription Plan shall equal the amount which would have been received by the Company had such payment been made free of such tax deduction or withholding.</p>\n4.6 Term\n<p>\n<strong>Automatic Renewal</strong>.\nYour Subscription Plan will automatically be renewed for successive terms on the applicable Billing Cycle (monthly or annual), unless you cancel your Subscription Plan by following the Subscription Cancellation Process within your Tenant in advance of the renewal date (\u201cCancellation\u201d).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Perimeter 81 may from time to time, increase fees or cancel offered Subscription Plans to enter into effect upon the subsequent billing cycle, in such event Perimeter 81 will provide you at least 30 days\u2019 written notice of such price increase and offer you the option to cancel the Subscription Plan prior to such billing cycle.</p>\n<p>Billing Cycles start at the beginning of the month and end at the last day of the last month of your Subscription Plan.\nIf you purchased a Subscription Plan in the middle of the month, you will be charged for a prorated amount for the first cycle on the day of the purchase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Co-Term.\n</strong>Should you elect to purchase the right to use additional features or add additional Users for an existing Subscription Plan (an \u201cAdditional Order\u201d) during the term of such Subscription Plan, the initial term of such Additional Order shall be pro-rated to concur with the existing Subscription Plan so that the renewal or expiry of the Subscription Plan and the Additional Order shall take effect on the same date.\nApplicable fees shall be pro-rated in accordance with the remaining term of the existing Subscription Plan.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n4.7 Cancellation.\nRefund.\nPolicy.\n<p>If you are a new user and have canceled your Subscription Plan by following the Cancellation process within the first thirty (30) days following the first invoice for the Service, you shall be entitled to receive a full refund following such cancellation by contacting us at&nbsp;support@Perimeter81.com.&nbsp;Otherwise, all payments made according to this Terms of Service are final and Perimeter 81 will not reimburse or refund any payments for any reason.\nShould your Tenant be hacked, you will not be refunded for any losses, even if the loss of control results in the deletion of your Tenant.\nIf you are using our Service through our App, any refunds are also subject to the Usage Rules of the applicable store from which you have purchased our App (i.e., Google Play or App store, as the case may be).<br>Should you, by any means or way, revoke or cancel any of your payments to Perimeter 81, Perimeter 81 shall be allowed to supply the third-party clearing or payment service any information about such transaction.\nincluding, but not only, your email address, your IP address and activity pursuant to such denied transaction.</p>\n<p>You hereby commit to paying in full any unpaid invoices that were issued prior to the Subscription Plan Cancellation.\nCanceling your Subscription Plan will not void any outstanding payments for the Subscription Period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In case you and/or your Users are using our Service through our App, you may opt-out of the Service at any time, by uninstalling our App from your device/s.\nHowever, please note that opting-out shall not automatically cancel your Subscription Plan (and/or entitle you to receive a refund), and the Services would still be available for use by you and/or your Users until the end of your Subscription Plan.</p>\n4.8 The Service \u2013 General Provisions\n<ul>\n<li>You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Service, and any
