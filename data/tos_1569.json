used site-wide.\nCookies are used for authentication and session data only.\nSite cookies are first-party, HTTP only and secure.</p> Information we collect <p>The data that is collected and stored by Feedbin are all the things you would expect that are necessary to run the service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Feed data</strong>: Feedbin is an RSS reader, so its primary purpose is to keep track of the things you are subscribed to.\nFeedbin also keeps track of which articles you have and have not read so it can display the read/unread status of articles.\nIf you star an article, Feedbin saves that too.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Email address</strong>: When you sign up, Feedbin asks for your email address and password.\nProviding an email address will result in the best experience.\nThings like password resets and email receipts depend on a valid email address.\nHowever if you would prefer not to provide an email address, then you don't have to.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Password</strong>: Your password is stored as a bcrypt hash.\nIt's an industry standard for storing passwords.\nIt means that even in the event that someone did obtain the bcrypt value, it would be very hard to derive your actual password from it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Billing information</strong>: If you choose to subscribe, your billing information is sent directly to Stripe, a leading online payments platform.\nBilling information is not stored by Feedbin for your security.\nYou can read more about their privacy policy and security practices.</li>\n</ul> Services <p>There are a number of services that can be configured to work with Feedbin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Twitter</strong>: If you subscribe to Twitter feeds through Feedbin, Feedbin will store read-only tokens to be able to retrieve Twitter data on your behalf.\nFeedbin cannot tweet or change your account or read your direct messages with the level of access Feedbin requests.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sharing Services</strong>: Some of the optional sharing services (Evernote, Instapaper, Pinboard, Tumblr, Micro.blog, Pocket) require Feedbin to store authentication data for them.\n</li>\n</ul> Information Usage <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.\nWe do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Feedbin\u2018s functionality.\nWe may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements.\nto exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.\nto investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies.\nor to protect our rights and property.\nIn the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or
