infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party and pay any damages finally settled or awarded in a trial to the third party with respect to any such claim, provided that UpCloud is notified promptly in writing of the claim and given sole control of the defense and all related settlement negotiations in relation to the claim as well as reasonable assistance and necessary authorisations from Customer to defend or settle the claims on behalf of Customer.\nAt any time, if UpCloud reasonably deems that any part of the Service infringes the intellectual property rights of any third party, UpCloud has the right at its own expense to (i) modify/replace the Service to eliminate the infringement in such a manner that the modified Service complies with this Agreement, or (ii) procure to Customer a right to use the Service.\nIf none of the aforementioned alternatives are reasonably possible, UpCloud shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and UpCloud shall refund to Customer the prices paid for the Service by Customer less the price corresponding the time Customer has been able to use the Service in accordance with this Agreement.\nUpCloud shall, however, not be liable for any infringement or claim thereof in the event the claim (i) is made by any affiliates of Customer.\n(ii) has resulted from Customer\u2019s or Customer\u2019s

Users.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> We will defend you against any claim that our services infringe on someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights, as long as you have followed these rules.\nIf you receive such a claim, please notify us as soon as possible so that we can assist you with it.</small>\n</p>\nCustomer Data.\n<p>Customer data shall mean all Customer\u2019s data that a Customer or another party acting on Customer\u2019s behalf generates in or submits to the Service (\u201cCustomer Data\u201d) or the data Customer submits to a third-party service or platform which might be accessed by the Service, subject to and on the basis of the permissions or consents Customer has granted.\nCustomer agrees that UpCloud does not assume any liability or responsibility in

inappropriate data to the Service.\nFor clarity, UpCloud is not responsible and shall not be held liable for any Customer Data, nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any Customer Data.\nAside from the rights specifically granted herein, Customer retains ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the Customer Data.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> Any data uploaded to or generated on your cloud servers are yours and yours only.\nWe cannot be held responsible for it and we refrain from applying our opinions and values towards it, as long as it\u2019s not illegal or breaking our terms of service.\nIn additional, we promise to keep your personal data safely and privately stored.</small>\n</p>\nData Processing.\n<p>In order to provide the Service, UpCloud may process personal data on behalf of the Customer as a data processor for the purposes of providing the Service.\nUpCloud processes certain personal data also as a data controller.\nSuch personal data includes, inter alia, data of the Customer\u2019s contact persons, invoicing details and other personal data of Customer\u2019s contact persons which UpCloud processes in order to maintain the customer relationship.\nThe requirements relating to the personal data UpCloud processes as data controller are set out in our Privacy Policy available on UpCloud\u2019s website.\nIn this section, \u201cPersonal Data\u201d refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person the Customer enters into the Service and UpCloud processes on behalf of the Customer in the course and within the scope of providing the Services.\nIn connection with the use of the Service, the Customer may transfer various data to UpCloud for processing on behalf of the Customer.\nSuch data might include Personal Data.\nThe Customer shall be considered as the sole data controller and UpCloud as the sole data processor with respect to such data.\nThe following terms and conditions set forth in this section concern the data processing activities of UpCloud as a data processor with respect to the Personal Data it processes on behalf of the Customer.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> We collect and process certain personal data (contact, billing and behavioural) in compliance with GDPR to better be able to provide you with our services.\nThis does not include any personal data you store on your cloud servers, which are not accessible by us and under your sole discretion.</small>\n</p>\nGeneral requirements relating to processing of Personal Data.\n<p>The Customer shall be responsible for the lawful collection, processing and use, and for the accuracy of the Personal Data, as well as for preserving the rights of the individuals concerned.\nIf and to the extent legally required, the Customer shall inform the individuals concerned regarding the processing of their Personal Data by UpCloud, and shall obtain their consent if necessary.\nThe Personal Data processed by UpCloud on behalf of the Customer may include e.g.\nPersonal Data of the Customer\u2019s employees and end-customers, such as contact details of the aforementioned data subjects.\nThe Customer acknowledges that due to the nature of the Service, UpCloud cannot control and has no obligation to verify Personal Data the Customer transfers to UpCloud for processing on behalf of the Customer when the Customer uses the Service.\nThe Customer ensures that the Customer is entitled to transfer the Personal Data to UpCloud so that UpCloud may lawfully process the Personal Data on behalf of the Customer in accordance with this Agreement.\nUpCloud shall not use Personal Data for any purpose other than that of rendering and providing the Service and will not assert liens or other rights over, or sell or disclose the Personal Data to any third parties, without the Customer\u2019s prior written approval.\nUpCloud shall process Personal Data in accordance with this Agreement and documented instructions from the Customer.\nThe Customer\u2019s instructions must be commercially reasonable, compliant with applicable data protection laws and consistent with this Agreement.\nUpCloud shall not be obliged to verify whether any instructions given by the Customer are consistent with applicable laws, as the Customer is responsible for such compliance verification of its instructions.\nHowever, if UpCloud detects that any instruction given by the Customer is non-compliant with the requirements of any data protection legislation applicable to UpCloud\u2019s operations, UpCloud shall inform the Customer in writing.\nUpCloud and the Customer shall comply with the EU Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (\u201cRegulation\u201d) and any applicable European or foreign data protection laws as amended, as well as data protection authorities\u2019 orders and guidelines.\nUpCloud and the Customer shall implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the Personal Data within their area of responsibility, in order to safeguard the Personal Data against unauthorised or unlawful processing or access and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.\nSuch measures include where necessary and appropriate, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons the following measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>access right controls to systems containing Personal Data;</li>\n<li>the pseudonymisation and encryption of Personal Data;</li>\n<li>the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;</li>\n<li>the ability to restore the availability and access to Personal Data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;</li>\n<li>a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> If you collect or process any personal data using our services, you are required to follow the General Data Protection Regulation.</small>\n</p>\nUpCloud\u2019s assistance obligations.\n<p>To respond to requests from individuals exercising their rights as foreseen in applicable data protection law, such as the right of access and the right to rectification or erasure, the Customer shall primarily use the corresponding functions of the Services, such as the UpCloud Control Panel.\nUpCloud shall provide the Customer with commercially reasonable assistance, without undue delay, taking into account the nature of the processing.\nUpCloud shall further provide the Customer with commercially reasonable assistance in ensuring compliance with the Customer\u2019s obligations to perform security and data protection assessments, breach notifications and prior consultations of the competent supervisory authority, as set out in the applicable data protection law, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to UpCloud.\nIn case such assistance requires extensive measures from UpCloud, the Customer shall pay additional reasonable remuneration to UpCloud for handling such assistance requests.\nIn addition, UpCloud shall, and shall procure that its personnel (including its subcontractors\u2019 personnel) shall:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>only process Personal Data in accordance with the Customer\u2019s written instructions and not for UpCloud\u2019s own purposes;</li>\n<li>ensure that individuals processing Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> You can exercise your right to view, modify, or delete your personal data through the UpCloud control panel.\nIn cases where you collect and process any personal data, we can help you to ensure compliance with GDPR.\nPlease note that extensive work may include additional costs.</small>\n</p>\nTransfers of Personal Data.\n<p>The Customer accepts that UpCloud may have Personal Data processed and accessible by its subprocessors outside the Customer\u2019s country of domicile to provide the Service.\nIn case the processing is subject to any EU data protection law and Personal Data is transferred from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) to a subprocessor for processing in any country outside the EEA that is not recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, UpCloud provides for appropriate safeguards by standard contractual clauses, adopted or approved by the European Commission and applicable to the processing by the non-EEA subprocessor or by any other appropriate safeguard as foreseen under Regulation.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> If we need to transfer your personal data to another country outside the EU we\u2019ll ensure the data remains secure.</small>\n</p>\nAudits.\n<p>The Customer shall have the right to audit the facilities and processing activities of UpCloud under this Agreement to examine the level of protection and security provided for Personal Data processed under this Agreement and to assess the compliance of UpCloud with the terms and conditions relating to Personal Data set out herein.\nEach Party shall bear its own costs for any such audit.\nWhere an audit may lead to the disclosure of business or trade secrets of UpCloud or threaten intellectual property rights of UpCloud, the Customer shall employ an independent expert to carry out the audit, and the expert shall agree to be bound to confidentiality to UpCloud\u2019s benefit.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> You have the right to audit our personal data protection and security processes.\nIf the audit would contain confidential information, you will need to employ an independent expert to do the audit.</small>\n</p>\nSubprocessors.\n<p>General authorization.\nThe Customer gives its general authorization to allow UpCloud to involve UpCloud\u2019s affiliated companies and other subcontractors as subprocessors to process Personal Data in connection with the provision of the Service, to the extent such appointment does not lead to non-compliance with any applicable law or UpCloud\u2019s obligations under this Agreement.\nUpCloud ensures that the involved subprocessors are properly qualified, will be under a data processing agreement with UpCloud, and comply with data processing obligations similar to the ones which apply to UpCloud under this Agreement.\nUpCloud shall be liable towards the Customer for the processing of Personal Data carried out by UpCloud\u2019s subprocessors.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> We might use third-parties that need to process your personal data to provide you with our services.\nIn such case we\u2019ll make sure they secure your data according to the same requirements as we do.</small>\n</p>\nChange of subprocessor.\n<p>UpCloud is free to choose and change its subprocessors.\nUpon request, UpCloud shall inform the Customer of subprocessors currently involved.\nIn case there is a later change of subprocessor (addition or replacement), UpCloud shall notify the Customer of such change.\nIn case the Customer objects such change of subprocessor on reasonable grounds, the Customer has the right to request change of the subprocessor.\nIf UpCloud is not willing to change the subprocessor the Customer has objected, the Customer shall have the right to terminate the Service and this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> We can change partners when needed.\nYou can ask about our current partners that might process your personal data and we\u2019ll let you know if they change in the future.</small>\n</p>\nBreaches.\n<p>UpCloud shall, without undue delay after having become aware of it, inform the Customer in writing about any data breaches relating to Personal Data and any other events where the security of Personal Data processed on behalf of the Customer has been compromised.\nUpCloud\u2019s notification about the breach to the Customer shall include at least the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>description of the nature of the breach;</li>\n<li>name and contact details of UpCloud\u2019s contact point where more information can be obtained;</li>\n<li>description of the measures taken by UpCloud to address the breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> We\u2019ll inform you of any security breach where your personal data might have been compromised.</small>\n</p>\nDeletion and return of Personal Data.\n<p>UpCloud shall not take any action to intentionally erase any Personal Data processed on behalf of the Customer, without the Customer\u2019s explicit request.\nPersonal Data shall be processed under this Agreement until the Customer has ceased to use the Service.\nWithin a reasonable time after the termination or expiry of this Agreement, or after the Customer has permanently ceased to use the Service, UpCloud shall permanently delete Personal Data from its storage media, except to the extent that UpCloud is under a statutory obligation to continue storing such Personal Data.\nOn the Customer\u2019s request, UpCloud shall confirm the deletion in writing.\nThe obligation to delete Personal Data shall not apply to Personal Data contained in regular back-up copies of comprehensive datasets from which the individual deletion of Personal Data would not be possible without significant efforts or costs.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> We will delete your personal data if requested, to the extent we are allowed to, and confirm it to you in writing.</small>\n</p>\nConfidentiality.\n<p>The Parties may exchange confidential information during the performance of this Agreement.\nConfidential information shall mean any information which is marked as confidential or which should be understood as confidential, irrespective of its form of storage or disclosure.\nAll confidential information shall remain the property of the disclosing Party and the receiving Party shall keep confidential and refrain from using such confidential information otherwise than for the purposes of this Agreement, during the term of this Agreement and after the termination of this Agreement.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, any information of or relating to a Party or that Party\u2019s personnel, suppliers, contractors, customers or end-users, which information is obtained or detected by the other Party or processed or generated in the course of providing or receiving the Service shall be deemed confidential information of that Party.\nEach Party shall promptly upon termination of the Service cease using confidential material and information received from the other Party and use reasonable means to destroy such material.\nEach Party shall, however, be entitled to retain the copies required by law or regulations.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> We will keep any confidential information we have exchanged between each other secured, and we expect you to do the same.</small>\n</p>\nIntellectual Property Rights.\n<p>All intellectual property rights to and in the Service as well as intellectual property rights pertaining thereto, are exclusive property of UpCloud or its licensors with all rights reserved.\nAll intellectual property rights to the content uploaded into the Service by or on behalf of the Customer will remain the exclusive property of the Customer or its licensors.\nCustomer agrees not to resell the Service or redistribute or transfer the Service.\nAll intellectual property rights relating to the provision of the Services, including suggestions for improvements made by the Customer, will remain the exclusive property of UpCloud or its licensors.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> You retain your rights to any data uploaded onto our services and we retain the rights to our intellectual property.</small>\n</p>\nLimited Warranty.\n<p>UpCloud will offer service level compensations to the Customer in accordance with the SLA.\nIn all other respects the Service is provided on \u201cas-is\u201d and \u201cas-available\u201d basis, and UpCloud will not give the Customer any warranty or guarantee, express or implied, for the Service, including but without limitation to warranties of merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, performance, or non-infringement.\nThe parties expressly note that the Service is not designed to be error-free or uninterrupted and therefore they are neither intended nor fit for purposes that require fail-safe performance.</p>\n<p>\n<small>\n<strong>tl;dr</strong> We offer compensation for interruptions to our services according to our Service Level Agreement but cannot provide any warranty or guarantee.</small>\n</p>\nLimited Liability.\n<p>UpCloud will not be liable for indirect damage or consequential damages caused to the Customer.\nUpCloud\u2019s total aggregate liability under or in connection with this Agreement shall be limited to the aggregate Service Fee paid by the Customer for the Service for the last six (6) months preceding the occurrence for which damages are claimed.\nThese limitations will not apply to damage caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence.\nIn order to be valid and enforceable, all claims for damages must be made within 30 days from

operating environment of the Services only within the limits of the user instructions.\nThe Customer may not use the Services in any way that causes security risks to the Service or interferes with the operation of the Services.\nFor example, UpCloud considers the following actions to be disruptive on the operation of the Services:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Intentional or careless use of the Services in excess of a typically expected server load, such as continuosly high CPU or I/O use rate</li>\n<li>Intentional or careless configuration of servers that enables unauthorized third party access or
