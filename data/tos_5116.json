<p>Support for Changelog is provided by sending an email to editors@changelog.com, or submit an issue on GitHub.</p> Access to your data What personal data do we collect and why? <p>We collect the following personal data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not collect your address or credit card information directly.\nSee the question \"Who can see my credit card number?\" below.</p>\n<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive.\nSuch addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that your browser must be enabled to accept cookies from changelog.com in order for you to use Changelog.</p>\n<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.</p> Who can see my password? <p>No one.\nWe never store your password unencrypted, so no one can read it.</p>\n<p>It is your sole responsibility to keep your user name, password and other sensitive information confidential.\nIf you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you shall notify Changelog immediately.</p>\n<p>If you forget your password, we send you a secure link via email that lets you reset it.</p> Who can see my credit card number? <p>No one at Changelog.\nWe use the very trustworthy and secure Stripe payment service.\nRead Stripe's Terms of Service to learn more about their security measures.\nIn short, they encrypt your credit card information.</p> Our commitment to children's privacy <p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.\nFor that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p> How can I access or correct my information? <p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in to Changelog site you have access to and visiting the settings pages.</p> What are the guidelines Changelog follows when accessing my data? <ul>\n<li>We restrict access to customer data to only senior members of Changelog, and never to outside contractors</li>\n<li>We only do it in response to a customer support question</li>\n<li>We only do it in order to debug and fix the issue</li>\n<li>We never make changes to anything unless explicitly requested by a site owner</li>\n<li>We never ever ever share what we see with other customers or the general public</li>\n<li>We might give access to US authorities if requested in writing.\nWe'll try not to, but we don't have the resources to fight the government.</li>\n</ul> How is my data protected from another customer's data? <p>All of our customers' data resides in the same database.\nWe use software best practices to guarantee only people who you designate as viewers of your data can access it.\nIn other words, we segment our customer data via software.\nWe do our best and are very confident we're doing a good job at it, but, like every other web software that hosts customer data in the same database, we cannot guarantee a highly sophisticated hacker cannot access other people's data.</p> How are you protecting my data from hacker attacks? <p>All of our servers are highly physically secured at DigitalOcean's data centers.\nWe also have our own practices in place, which follow the industry's best practices.\nWe keep our servers always up to date with security fixes, have one-click ways to take down servers should they become infected/compromised and to create and deploy new clean ones.</p> What should I do if I find a security vulnerability in Changelog? <p>If you have discovered a security concern, please contact us immediately using our contact form.\nWe'll work with you to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern.\nWe consider correspondence sent through our contact form the highest priority, and work to address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Please act in good faith towards our users' privacy and data during your disclosure.\nWe won't take legal action against you or administrative action against your account if you act accordingly: White hat researchers are always appreciated.</p> Intellectual Property Rights Who owns Changelog materials? <p>Changelog materials are all the information, data, documents (e.g.\nwhite papers, press releases, datasheets, FAQs,

discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p> Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information <p>Certain visitors to Changelog choose to interact with it in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information.\nThe amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction.\nFor example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Changelog.com to provide a name and email address.\nThose who engage in transactions with Changelog \u2013 by purchasing a Pro membership, for example, are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.\nIn each case, Changelog collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Changelog.\nChangelog does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.\nAnd visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p> Aggregated Statistics <p>Changelog may collect statistics about the behavior of our visitors.\nFor instance, we track views and clicks on a post to determine usage and engagement.\nChangelog may display this information publicly or provide it to others.\nHowever, Changelog does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p> Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information <p>Changelog discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Changelog's behalf or to provide services available at Changelog's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.\nSome of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country.\nby using Changelog's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.\nChangelog will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.\nOther than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Changelog discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Changelog believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Changelog, third parties or the public at large.\nIf you are a registered user of an Changelog website and have supplied your email address, Changelog may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Changelog and our products.\nWe primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.\nIf you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.\nChangelog takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p> Cookies <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nChangelog uses cookies to help Changelog identify and track visitors, their usage of Changelog website, and their website access preferences.\nChangelog visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Changelog's websites, with the drawback that certain features of our website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p> Business Transfers <p>If Changelog, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Changelog goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nYou acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Changelog may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p> Ads and Sponsorships <p>Ads and Sponsorships appearing on Changelog may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.\nThese cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.\nThis information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.\nThis Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Changelog and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p> Privacy Policy Changes <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and in our sole discretion.\nWe encourage our visitors to watch this repository on GitHub to track changes to this document, our Privacy Policy.\nYour continued use of this
