as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, as applicable, to the United States in reliance on Privacy Shield.\nEveryAction has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this statement and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit here or view our certification here.\nFor purposes of enforcing compliance with the Privacy Shield, EveryAction is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal Data Collection and Use</strong>.\nEveryAction provides online platforms and tools that our customers use to operate aspects of their businesses or organizations.\nThese include platforms and tools for charitable or political campaign giving, managing and organizing political or social advocacy campaigns, political campaign finance compliance, social engagement and community building, data visualization, integration and analytics, and platforms for building websites and applications.\nIn providing these platforms and tools, EveryAction processes data our customers submit to our services or instruct us to process on their behalves.\nWhile EveryAction's customers decide what data to submit, it typically includes information about their constituents, publicly available voter files, employees or volunteers, donation and outreach history, and users of online platforms or tools, such as contact information, purchases, and billing information.\nEveryAction processes data submitted by customers for the purpose of providing EveryAction's online services to our customers, which may require EveryAction to access the data to provide the services, to correct and address technical or service problems, or to follow instructions of an EveryAction customer who submitted the data, or in response to our contractual requirements.\nEveryAction's Privacy Policy located here provides a fuller description of the categories of data that we may receive in the United States, the purposes for which we use that data, and the measures we take to safeguard that personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Transfers to Third Parties</strong>.\nEveryAction uses certain third-party service providers to assist us in providing our services to our customers, such as performing database monitoring and other technical operations, assisting with the transmission of data, and providing data storage services.\nThese third-party service providers may access, process, or store personal data.\nWe take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third-party service providers process personal data in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations, including restricting their access, use, or disclosure of personal data.\nUnder certain circumstances, we may be liable for the failure of our third-party service providers to meet their obligations in their handling of personal data and we are found to be responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Compelled Disclosures</strong>.\nUnder certain circumstances, we may disclose your personal data in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\nTo the extent permitted, EveryAction will inform its relevant customer or prospective customer before making such disclosure and provide it with a reasonable opportunity to object to such disclosure.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access Rights</strong>.\nYou may have the right to access the personal data that we hold about you and to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield.\nThese access rights may not apply in some cases, including where providing access is unreasonably burdensome or expensive under the circumstances or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access.\nBecause EveryAction personnel have limited ability to access data our customers submit to our services, if you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, please submit a written request to the contact information provided here including the name of the EveryAction customer who submitted your data to our services.\nWe will refer your request to that customer and will support them as needed in responding to your request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Questions or Complaints</strong>.\nYou can direct any questions or complaints about the use or disclosure of your personal data to us here.\nWe will respond within 45 days of receiving your communication.\nIf you are unsatisfied with the resolution of your complaint, you may contact the EU data protection authorities, the UK Information Commissioner, or the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner for further information and assistance.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>.\nFor any complaints that cannot be resolved with EveryAction directly, EveryAction has chosen JAMS as an independent recourse mechanism to facilitate alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services including binding arbitration.\nYou may have the option to select binding arbitration for the resolution of your complaint under certain circumstances, provided you have taken the following steps: (1) raised your compliant directly with EveryAction and provided us the opportunity to resolve the issue and (2) raised the issue through the relevant data protection authority and allowed the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce an opportunity to resolve the complaint at no cost to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes to

information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative, which may vary based on the nature of your request.</li>\n<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.</p>\n<p>Making a verifiable Consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\nHowever, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.</p>\n<p>We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable Consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the

you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>\n<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt of the verifiable Consumer request.\nThe response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.\nFor data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically a .csv file.</p>\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable Consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Non-Discrimination.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates

available by that integrator.\nWe are not responsible for third-party integrators and in no case are such integration providers our sub-processors.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Compliance with Legal Obligations.</em>\n</strong> We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party if (i) we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements), (ii) to enforce our agreements and policies, (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our services and products, (iv) to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (v) to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.\nIf EveryAction is required by law to disclose any Personal Information, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of the disclosure requirement, unless prohibited by law.\nFurther, we may object to requests we do not believe were issued properly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Business transfers.</em>\n</strong> If we go through a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, data we gather from you may be part of the assets transferred or shared in

above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.\nHowever, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.\nIn certain cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you.</p>\n<p>If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of

offline.\nThese measures vary based on the sensitivity of the Personal Information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.\nWe also take measures to ensure service providers that process Personal Information on our behalf also have appropriate security controls in place.</p>\n<p>Please note that no service is completely secure.\nWhile we strive to protect your data, we

Frameworks, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission.\nIn certain situations, we may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>\n<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge to you) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.\nUnder certain conditions, more fully described in our Privacy Shield Statement (available here) and on the Privacy Shield website (here) you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>\n<p>In certain circumstances, we may rely on the European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses, involving transfers of Personal Information from Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and EEA to the United States.</p>\n<strong>\n<em>Retention of Your Personal Information</em>\n</strong>\n<p>Details regarding how long your Personal Information may be stored on our systems will depend on whether you are a Customer, Visitor, or Contact.\nGenerally, we will only retain your Personal Information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected or placed into our systems.\nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing, here is an overview of how long we hold on to Personal Information in a form that can be used to identify you:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Customers.</em>\n</strong> As an EveryAction Customer, we will retain these records for as long you instruct.\nIn some cases, use of extended storage may cost more.\nIf you later instruct us to delete those records, we will do so.\nPlease note that it may take 30 days or longer for the data to be completely removed from all systems.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Visitors.</em>\n</strong> Generally, we retain your Personal Information for only as long as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.\nhowever, certain Visitors to our Customer's donation or giving webpages may have their Personal Information stored through the use of a cookie up to 10 years to allow prepopulating of web forms on the same or other Customer donation or giving webpages.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Contacts.</em>\n</strong> If the EveryAction Materials enable a Customer to store records of your Personal Information contained within its data, and that Customer chooses to do so, then we will retain this data for as long our Customer instructs, subject to applicable law.\nYou should direct requests seeking further information relating to retention of your Personal Information to the relevant Customer to address.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Deletion Request.</em>\n</strong> If you are a Customer or Visitor and you
