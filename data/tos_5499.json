for commercial purposes, such as selling or renting such lists to other businesses for their direct marketing purposes.\n<em>We</em> may send you offers and promotions for <em>our</em> products, programs, and events, or those that we think may be of interest to you, and you may opt-out or unsubscribe from such offers by either following the instructions provided in our communications to you or changing your preferences in your account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you have separately joined one of our affinity groups, such as Scouting Alumni &amp.\nFriends, you may receive as a benefit of membership targeted offers and promotions for products and services from carefully selected third parties.\nYou may exercise your choice to not receive such offers or promotions at any time by following the third party\u2019s opt-out procedures or contacting us at the address listed below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Tracking Technologies</u>.\nWe use cookies to track user activity on our websites and online services, but we do not collect personal information about your online activities over time as you move across other websites and online services.\nWeb browsers can transmit Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) signals that indicate that a user does not wish to have activity tracked.\nCurrently, no universally accepted standard exists for how to interpret such signals, and we do not respond to Do Not Track signals.\nThus, whether or not you have turned on your DNT setting should not affect your experience or interaction with our websites or online services.\nLearn more about Do Not Track.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Children\u2019s Privacy</strong>\n<p>Digital privacy is a component of BSA\u2019s commitment to youth protection and safety.\nAs such, we do not collect the personal information of children under the age of 13 unless a child\u2019s parent or legal guardian provides it to us through the online membership registration process or a child provides it to us to enter a contest or promotion.\nIn any event, consistent with the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), a parent may review or have deleted their child\u2019s personal information, and prohibit its further collection or use.\nIf you have a request in relation to the personal information of your child below the age of 13, please send an email to privacy@scouting.org.</p>\n<p>For contests and promotions, we typically require only the information necessary for a child to enter, such as first name (to distinguish among family members) and his or her online contact information.\nWe will only use the child\u2019s online contact information to enter him or her into the contest or promotion and contact him or her once when the contest ends.\nIf a contest or sweepstakes asks the child to submit his or her own created content with the entry and that content contains the child\u2019s personal information, then we will either pre-screen the submission to remove any personal information or seek parental consent by email for the collection.\nTo facilitate delivery of the contest\u2019s prize, we may ask a child at the time of entry to also provide her or her parent or legal guardian\u2019s online contact information, which we will only use to notify the parent or legal guardian if the child wins the contest or promotion.</p>\n<p>Our sites and applications that are age-gated are not intended for use by children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 through those sites and applications.\nIn the unlikely event we discover that we have collected personal information from a child other than as described in this section, we will either delete the information immediately or promptly seek the parent or legal guardian\u2019s consent to use the information.</p>\n<strong>Data Security, Integrity and Retention</strong>\n<p>The security, integrity and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us.\nWe have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect guest information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification.\nFrom time to time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and methods.\nPlease be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.\nWe will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>\n<strong>Changes</strong>\n<p>From time to time, we may change this privacy policy to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes.\nWe will provide notice to you if these changes are material, either by direct notice or posting an announcement on the websites where this policy is posted, and, if required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent.</p>\n<strong>Comments and Questions</strong>\n<p>If you have a comment or question about this policy or our treatment of your information, you may email us at privacy@scouting.org, write to us at Boy Scouts of America, Attn: Privacy Compliance-Legal Department, 1325 West Walnut Hill Lane, Irving, Texas 75038, or contact our Member Care Center at (972)

Regulation</u>:</p>\n<p>Article 13 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires those who collect personal information from individuals in the European Union to provide certain
