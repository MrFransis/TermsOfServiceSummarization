"/html/body/idguard/div[1]/div[3]/div", "text": "<p>The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies.\nThere are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records).\nHere is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA.<strong>&nbsp;For more information, including information about additional rights, go to&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;or write to:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</p>\n<p>1700 G Street N.W.,</p>\n<p>Washington, DC 20006.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You must be told if information in your file has been used against you.</strong>&nbsp;Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance or employment \u2014 or take another adverse action against you \u2014 must tell you and give you the name, address and phone number of the agency that provided the information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You have the right to know what is in your file.</strong>&nbsp;You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your \u201cfile disclosure\u201d).\nYou will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number.\nIn many cases, the disclosure will be free.\nYou are entitled to a free file disclosure if: a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in a report.\nyou are the victim of identity theft and place a fraud alert in your file.\nyour file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud.\nyou are on public assistance.\nor you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.\nIn addition, all consumers are entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies.\nSee&nbsp;www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore&nbsp;for additional information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You have the right to ask for a credit score.</strong>&nbsp;Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus.\nYou may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it.\nIn some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information.</strong>&nbsp;If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous.\nSee&nbsp;www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore&nbsp;for an explanation of dispute procedures.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information.&nbsp;</strong>Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days.\nHowever, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information.</strong>&nbsp;In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than ten years old.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access to your file is limited.</strong>&nbsp;A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need \u2014 usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord or other business.\nThe FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers.</strong>&nbsp;A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer.\nWritten consent generally is not required in the trucking industry.\nFor more information, go to&nbsp;www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You may limit \u201cprescreened\u201d offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report.</strong>&nbsp;Unsolicited \u201cprescreened\u201d offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on.\nYou may opt out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPT-OUT.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You may seek damages from violators.</strong>&nbsp;If a consumer reporting agency, or in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights.</strong>&nbsp;For more information, visit&nbsp;www.consumerfinance.gov/learnmore.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>States may enforce the FCRA, and many states have their own consumer reporting laws.\nIn some cases, you

UNABLE TO RESOLVE A COMPLAINT YOU MAY HAVE WITH AURA OR AURA\u2019S SERVICE PROVIDER(S) TO YOUR SATISFACTION (OR IF AURA AND/OR AURA\u2019S SERVICE PROVIDER(S) HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITH YOU AFTER ATTEMPTING TO DO SO INFORMALLY), YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND AURA AND/OR AURA\u2019S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT INSTEAD OF IN COURTS OF GENERAL JURISDICTION TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\nARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\nARBITRATION USES A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY, ALLOWS FOR MORE LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT, AND IS SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY COURTS.\nARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD.\nANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nCLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.\nWE WILL PAY ALL COSTS OF ARBITRATION, NO MATTER WHO WINS, SO LONG AS YOUR CLAIM IS NOT FRIVOLOUS.\nHOWEVER, IN ARBITRATION, YOU, ON THE ONE HAND, AND AURA AND/OR AURA\u2019S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES FROM EACH OTHER PARTY TO THE SAME EXTENT AS YOU AND THEY WOULD BE IN COURT.</p>\n<p>You, on the one hand, and Aura and/or Aura\u2019s service provider(s), on the other, agree that any claim or dispute (\"Claim\") between us shall, at the election of any one of us, be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under its rules for consumer arbitrations.\nIt is the parties' intent that this arbitration provision be construed broadly, including that this arbitration agreement includes any Claims by You against Aura or Aura\u2019s service provider(s) as well as their respective corporate affiliates for claims arising out of this Agreement directly related to the services or product/service websites.\nHowever, any disputes or claims you may have which relate to your credit report, or any claims arising out of or relating to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) and/or the FCRA\u2019s state law equivalent(s), are not subject to or governed by this agreement to arbitrate.\nYou agree that, by entering into this Agreement, You, Aura and Aura\u2019s service provider(s) are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nAt your request, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of your arbitration filing fee.\n(The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.\nIf you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly after receiving a written request).\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual Claim.\nYOU, ON ONE HAND, AND AURA AND/OR AURA\u2019S SERVICE PROVIDER(S), ON THE OTHER, AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both You, on one hand, and Aura and/or Aura\u2019s service provider(s), on the other, agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's Claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nIf this specific provision in the preceding sentence is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision in this Section 18 shall be null and void.\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, any party may bring an individual action in small claims court.\nThe parties to this Agreement acknowledge that this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq.\n(\"FAA\").\nJudgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator shall follow substantive law to the extent consistent with the FAA and shall honor any claims or privileges recognized by law.</p>\n<p>The terms of this Section 18 shall survive any termination, cancellation or expiration of this Agreement.</p>19.\nMiscellaneous Provisions<p>Identity theft insurance is governed by a master policy the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.\nThe issuance of the policy is evidenced

Report-Related Disclosures for US Residents<p>This product is not intended as a substitute for consumer reports or other information that may be available to you without charge.\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act you are entitled to obtain one free credit file disclosure annually from each of the three nationwide credit reporting systems (Equifax\u00ae, Experian\u00ae, and TransUnion\u00ae) and you may be eligible for additional free reports under certain circumstances, such as, if you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment, if you are receiving public welfare assistance, if you have reason to believe information in your file is inaccurate as a result of fraud, if you have placed a fraud alert or extended fraud alert on your file, or if you have been subject to an adverse action based in whole or in part on the contents of your consumer report.</p>\n<p>You also may be entitled to free file disclosures under state law.\nMA, VT, CO, MD, ME and NJ permit consumers to obtain one credit file per credit reporting agency per year, free of charge.\nGA permits consumers to obtain two credit files per credit reporting agency per year, free of charge.</p>\n<p>NOTICE TO ILLINOIS RESIDENTS: MANY GOVERNMENT RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE FREE OR AT A NOMINAL COST FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.\nCREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO GIVE YOU A COPY OF YOUR CREDIT RECORD UPON REQUEST AT NO CHARGE OR FOR A NOMINAL FEE.</p>\n<p>The states of MA, VT, CO, NJ, MD and ME permit consumers to obtain one credit report per credit reporting agency per year, free of charge.\nThe state of GA permits consumers to obtain two credit reports per credit reporting agency per year, free of charge.</p>\n<p>This Service is not intended to substitute for any free credit report or disclosure that any credit reporting agency or bureau is required by law to provide to you.\nNeither you nor anyone else has the right to have accurate and current information removed from your credit report.\nIf information in your credit report is inaccurate, you have the right to dispute it by contacting the credit bureau directly.</p>\n<p>VANTAGESCORE 3.0 CREDIT SCORE: VantageScore 3.0, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by the three major nationwide credit reporting agencies, Experian\u00ae, TransUnion\u00ae, and Equifax\u00ae.\nVantageScore 3.0 is used by some but not all lenders.\nHigher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders.\nA lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.</p>\n<p>There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file.\nCredit scores are based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested.\nYour credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies.\nSo your credit scores can vary if the information they have on file for you is different.\nSince the information in your file can change over time, your credit scores also may be different from day-to-day.\nDifferent credit scoring models can also give a different assessment of the credit risk (risk of default) for the same consumer and same credit file.</p>\n<p>There are different credit scoring models which may be used by lenders and insurers.\nYour lender may not use VantageScore 3.0, so don't be surprised if your lender gives you a score that's different from your VantageScore.\n(And your VantageScore 3.0 may differ from your score under other types of VantageScores).\nJust remember that your associated risk level is often the same even if the number is not.\nFor some consumers, however, the risk assessment of VantageScore 3.0 could vary, sometimes substantially, from a lender\u2019s score.\nIf the lender's score is lower than your VantageScore 3.0, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.</p>22.\nTrademark and

to one of our member areas.\nDoing so permits us to understand and accommodate your online preferences and manage your relationship with us.</p>\n<p>We also use various technologies to collect and retain information about visits to our websites and use of our mobile applications.\nOur websites, for example, may use first and third party cookies.\nCookies are small bits of computer code that we or third parties with whom we have a relationship may install on your computer when it accesses our websites.\nWe also may use \u201cweb beacons\u201d (also referred to as \u201cpixel tags\u201d, \u201cclear gifs\u201d or other terms) or similar technologies to collect information such as how long a visitor remains on a particular page.\nCookies make your visit to our websites and mobile applications easier and more convenient.\nWe may use cookies for purposes such as to authenticate users, provide tailored content, to facilitate the display of advertisements, or to determine whether a visitor is unique or has viewed our site before.\nWhile most browsers are set to accept cookies by default, Web browsers typically also have features that permit you to refuse cookies or to alert you before accepting them.\nYour browser manufacturer has information on changing the default setting for your specific browser.\nPlease understand that if you refuse to accept cookies from our websites, you may not be able to use some portions of our websites or our services.</p>\n<p>Our websites and mobile applications also may use various technologies to collect information when someone visits our websites or uses our mobile applications.\nFor example, as you browse one of our websites we may collect information about your visit, but not identifiers such as your name, phone number or e-mail address.\nVia Web server logs, for example, we may monitor statistics such as: the number of people that visit our site, the date and time of the visit, geographic location information about the visitor, which page(s) are visited on our site, from which domain our visitors come (e.g., aol.com, hotmail.com, etc.), and the type of Internet browsers people use to visit our site (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari (for Apple Computers), Mozilla Firefox, etc.).\nWe also may use tools that allow us to monitor which links visitors are using, what content on our site is being viewed, or how a visitor is accessing content through our site.\nWe also may use outsourcing programs, such as Google Analytics, to assist us in analyzing data to better understand traffic to our websites, to tailor our websites and for advertising purposes.\nIf you would like to opt-out of Google Analytics, please&nbsp;click here&nbsp;for additional information and instructions from Google about how to do so.\nAnother one of our service providers is Adobe Marketing Cloud, which collects and uses personal information about our customers in order to help us deliver personalized marketing content.\nYou can opt-out of the collection and use of such information by Adobe by clicking&nbsp;here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may use Google and other third-party advertising companies and advertising

other websites over time in order to provide advertisements on this and other websites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.\nWith Google, for example, we use several Google offerings, including Display Advertising, Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting as part of our online advertising efforts.\nFor more information about how these Google advertising tools work,&nbsp;click here.\nIn addition to the Google Analytics opt-out described in the preceding paragraph, Google also has a mechanism that allows individuals to customize their advertising preferences.\nFor more information, please&nbsp;click here.\nWe may also utilize other third party online advertising technologies for these purposes, such as Bing, Taboola, Outbrain, Facebook and Quora.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This information often is aggregate data or individual information that is tied to a browser or device rather than specific identifiers such as the visitor\u2019s name and address.\nhowever, some of this information might be considered to be personally identifiable under some federal or state laws.\nIf you would like more information about network advertising and to know your choices about not having this information used by third-party advertising companies, please&nbsp;click here.</p>\n<p>We also may use other third-party services, such as Heap, Google Tag Manager, Fullstory, Google Optimize, Forfiti, Impact, Hitpath and Marketo to assist us in analyzing the activity of visitors to our website(s) that rely on cookies and other technologies.\nThese may collect information such as whether you are a returning visitor, without collecting personally identifying information such as your name.\nWe also may use such technologies&nbsp.\nto record images of activity on public pages of our website(s), such as mouse scrolls, clicks and/or keystrokes.\nWe do not, however, record images using Heap or similar technologies inside the member center.</p>\n<p>Some Internet browsers offer what often is referred to as \u201cdo not track\u201d mechanisms for browser users to automatically signal privacy preferences to websites that they visit.\nOur site(s) do not currently respond to do-not-track-signals, but some of our service providers honor these do not track preferences.\nFor additional information, please visit the opt-out links above.\nYou can exercise other choices available to you, including limiting the placement of cookies on your device using your browser\u2019s cookie control features and other choices described in this privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Finally, Intersections websites may include links to websites operated by third parties.\nWe do not control the information,
