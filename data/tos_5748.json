data on how the user uses our Services.\n2) aggregate data on the content with which the user engages.\nWe collect information to provide better Services to you\u2014from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\u2019ll find most useful or which LARK PLAYER videos you might like.\nThe information we collect, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\n</p>\n<p> &nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>You understand and consent that we may provide and share the information to our partners,

thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International

Kong.\nThe number of arbitrators shall be one.\nThe arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>C.\nIf the arbitration clauses above are determined to be totally invalid or non-enforceable, then any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Hong Kong, and you hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the territory and the courts of Hong Kong.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>D.\nYou acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made to the Company under the Terms are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Company for which remedies at law are inadequate.\nThe Company shall therefore be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligation to post any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.\nYou irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>3.User

configuring your information technology, computer programs, and platform to access our Services.\nYou should use your own virus protection software.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Severability.\nIf any court of

legal import.\nUpon the Company\u2019s request, you will furnish the Company with any documentation, substantiation, or releases necessary to verify your compliance with the

Action Waiver.&nbsp;Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiffs, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d).\nThe parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum.\nIf the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration.\nAny claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nThe parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.\nIf this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and the Company each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Third-Party Services and Rights.&nbsp;We use third-party services to
