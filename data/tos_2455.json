"//body//div[@class=\"mxcontent__main__doc\"]", "text": "Matrix Code of Conduct<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Matrix community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour.\nWe are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all, and expect our code of conduct to be honoured.\nAnyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.</p>\n<p>This applies to conversation in the any room in the matrix community (+matrix:matrix.org) and commits and comments relating to any project in the matrix-org github space.</p>\n<p>Our open source community strives to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be welcoming</strong>: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.\nThis includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be considerate</strong>: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others.\nAny decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.\nRemember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be respectful</strong>: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners.\nWe might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be careful in the words that we choose</strong>: Be kind to others.\nDo not insult or put down other participants.\nHarassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren't acceptable.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Try to understand why we disagree</strong>: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time.\nIt is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.\nRemember that we\u2019re different.\nThe strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds.\nDifferent people have different perspectives on issues.\nBeing unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re wrong.\nDon\u2019t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn\u2019t get us anywhere.\nInstead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</li>\n</ul>Definitions<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation</li>\n<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person\u2019s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>\n<li>Deliberate misgendering.\nThis includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person's gender identity.\nYou must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle</li>\n<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like \u201c<em>hug</em>\u201d or \u201c<em>backrub</em>\u201d) without consent or after a request to stop</li>\n<li>Threats of violence, both physical and psychological</li>\n<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm</li>\n<li>Deliberate intimidation</li>\n<li>Stalking or following</li>\n<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>\n<li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>\n<li>Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour</li>\n<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>\n<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>\n<li>Deliberate \u201couting\u201d of any aspect of a person\u2019s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse</li>\n<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not act on complaints regarding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good faith and non-malicious conduct whose object is to ameliorate the conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</li>\n<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as \u201cleave me alone,\u201d \u201cgo away,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not discussing this with you\u201d</li>\n<li>Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts</li>\n<li>Communicating in a \u2018tone\u2019 you don\u2019t find congenial</li>\n<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour or assumptions</li>\n</ul>Diversity Statement<p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all.\nAlthough we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible.\nWhenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it.\nIf someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.</p>\n<p>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability.\nWe will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected\ncharacteristics above, including participants with disabilities.</p>\n<p>Matrix.org and The Matrix.org Foundation takes a position on acceptable behaviour for its community as defined by the CoC, and we will not endorse behaviour which is counter to that.\nMatrix.org does not have a mandate to promote content which is associated with an entity whose position is incompatible with this CoC.</p>Reporting Issues<p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour \u2014 or have any other concerns \u2014 please report it by contacting us via abuse@matrix.org.\nAll reports will be handled with discretion.\nIn your report please include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your contact information.</li>\n<li>Names (usernames and nicks, real names, and/or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.\nIf there are additional witnesses, please\ninclude them as well.\nYour account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.</li>\n<li>The date and time of the incident (or start of incident).</li>\n<li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond.\nIf the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.\nIf the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team.\nWe will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.</p>Attribution &amp.\nAcknowledgements<p>This Code of Conduct is based on the TODO Group's Open Code of Conduct template, but with some modifications.</p>", "created_at": "2021-03-09

English, Not Legalese<p>Most Privacy Policy documents are unreadable.\nThey are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.</p>\n<p>Data protection and privacy are important, and we want you to understand the issues involved.\nFor that reason we decided to use plain English instead as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible.</p>\n<p>When you read 'the Matrix.org homeserver' or 'the Service' below, it refers to the services made available at <strong>https://matrix.org </strong>which store your account and personal conversation history, provide services such as bots and bridges, and communicate via the open Matrix decentralised communication protocol with the public Matrix Network.</p>\n<p>The public Matrix Network is a <em>decentralised</em> and <em>openly federated</em> communication network.\nThis means that user messages are replicated on each participant's server and messages posted to a room are visible to all participants including in some cases any new joiners.\nThis is further explained at 2.3.</p>\n<p>Where you read <em>The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C.</em>, <em>The Matrix.org Foundation</em>, or <em>The Foundation</em>, it refers to the Community Interest Company incorporated on 29 October 2018 to be the neutral custodian of the Matrix protocol: The Matrix Foundation C.I.C., and their agents.</p>\n<p>Where you read <em>Element </em>(trading name of New Vector Ltd.\nand New Vector SARL), <em>Element.io,</em> or <em>we</em>, <em>our</em>, or <em>us</em> below, it refers to the company we created in July 2017 to hire the Matrix core team and support Matrix's development and so run the Matrix.org homeserver: New Vector Ltd., and its French subsidiary: New Vector SARL and their agents.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Matrix protocol is licensed by the Matrix Foundation which makes it available to third parties who set up their own homeserver.\nThis privacy policy does not apply to such Matrix servers run by anyone else - Matrix is an open network like the Web and this agreement only applies to the server (Matrix.org) provided by Element.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Matrix.org is the Data Controller for the Service.\nWe can be contacted as per the details below:</p>\n<p>Email: dpo@matrix.org</p>\n<p>Postal address:</p>\n<p>The Matrix.org Foundation</p>\n<p>c/o New Vector Ltd</p>\n<p>10 Queen Street Place</p>\n<p>London</p>\n<p>United Kingdom</p>\n<p>EC4R 1AG</p>\n<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please send us an email at dpo@matrix.org.</p>1.2 This Is a Living Document<p>This is a living document.\nWith your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.</p>\n<p>If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We're all ears! Email dpo@matrix.org and we'll chat.</p>\n<p>We don't amend this document for any specific users or use case, but if your proposed changes apply to all of our users, we'll be happy to update it for everyone.\nScroll to the bottom to see the history so far.</p>\n<p>We will likely improve this document over time and we will take steps to inform our users about any updates.\nBy continuing to use the Service, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.\nIf updates to this document are ever associated with significant changes to the way we collect our process your data, we will promptly notify you.</p>\n<p>Your access and use of the Service is always subject to the most current version of this document.</p>2.\nAccess to Your Data / Privacy Policy2.1 What is the legal basis for processing my data and how does this affect my rights under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)?2.1.1 Legal Basis for Processing<p>Element processes your data under a Legitimate Interest basis of processing, to provide our Service to you in an efficient and secure manner and to ensure the legal compliance and proper administration of our business.\nEssentially, this means that we process your data only as necessary to deliver the Service and for internal administration purposes, and in a manner that you understand and expect.\nWe also carry out processing that is necessary to provide our Service to you under our Matrix.org Homeserver Terms and Conditions and processing that is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.\nWhere consent is required by law in relation to certain processing, we will ask for your consent.</p>\n<p>We process your information for the purposes of providing our decentralised, openly-federated and end-to-end encrypted communication Service, getting in touch with you, responding to your requests, working with our suppliers to deliver the Service and enabling its features, ensuring the security of our Service, developing, fixing and improving our Service, administering our business and complying with the law.</p>\n<p>The nature of the Service and its implementation results in some caveats concerning this processing, particularly in terms of GDPR Article 17 <em>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)</em>.\nWe believe these caveats (discussed in the section below in detail) are in line with the broader societal interests served by providing the Service.</p>\n<p>In situations where the interests of the individual appear to be in conflict with the broader societal interests, we will seek to reconcile those differences guided by our policy.</p>2.1.2 Your Rights as Data Subject<p>You have rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you.\nSome of these only apply in certain circumstances.\nSome of these rights are explored in more detail elsewhere in this document.\nFor completeness, your rights under GDPR are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The right to be informed</li>\n<li>The right of access</li>\n<li>The right to rectification</li>\n<li>The right to erasure</li>\n<li>The right to restrict processing</li>\n<li>The right to data portability</li>\n<li>The right to object</li>\n<li>Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We may ask for proof of identity before responding to your request.\nFor more details about these rights, please see the guidance provided by the ICO.\nIf you have any questions or are unsure how to exercise your rights, please contact us at dpo@matrix.org.</p>2.1.3 Right to Erasure<p>You can request that we forget your copy of messages and files by instructing us to deactivate your account (using a Matrix client such as the Element chat app) and selecting the option instructing us to forget your messages.\nWhat happens next depends on who else had access to the messages and files you had shared.</p>\n<p>Any messages or files that were only accessible by your account will be deleted from our servers within 30 days.</p>\n<p>Where you shared messages or files with another registered Matrix user, that user will still have access to their copy of those messages or files.\nApart from state events (see 2.1.3.1 below), these messages and files will <em>not</em> be shared with any unregistered or new users who view the room after we have processed your request to be forgotten.</p>\n<p>State events are processed differently to non-state events.\nState events are used by the Service to record, amongst other things, your membership in a room, the configuration of room settings, your changing of another user's power level and your banning a user from a room.\nWere we to erase these state events from a room entirely, it would be very damaging to other users' experience of the room, causing banned users to become unbanned, revoking legitimate administrator privileges, etc.\nWe therefore share state events sent by your account with all non-essential data removed ('redacted'), even after we have processed your request to be forgotten.\nThis means that your username will continue to be publicly associated with rooms in which you have participated, even after we have processed your request to be forgotten.\nWe are actively working on a solution to work around this restriction and allow you to be fully forgotten while maintaining a high quality experience for other users.\nIf this is not acceptable to you, please do not use the Service.</p>2.1.3.1 Exceptional Erasure<p>As described above, erasing a state event may result in our needing to erase the entire conversation at the same time.\nDeciding whether to take this drastic step will require a balancing exercise to be carried out at the time of the request, and will depend on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the nature of the Personal Data that the user is requesting to be erased;</li>\n<li>how many other users would have their fundamental rights and freedoms put at risk if the Right to Erasure were to be exercised</li>\n<li>to what degree these other users would have their fundamental rights and freedoms put at risk if the Right to Erasure were to be exercised</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Personal Data contained in a state event is usually limited to the username, the timestamp and the conversation in which the state event was issued.\nState events only represent that a user participated in a given conversation at a given time.\nIt is rare that this data is sensitive enough to warrant its erasure given the drastic impact this will have on other users.</p>\n<p>Each case will be decided based on the factors listed above.\nIn most situations we will not erase state events.\nIn extreme situations, where not erasing state events will place people at material risk of harm, we may choose to erase state events or remove the entire conversation.</p>2.1.3 Data Portability<p>Under GDPR you have a right to request a copy of your data in a commonly-accepted format.\nIf you would like a copy of your data, please send a request over Matrix to dpo@matrix.org.\nIn the future we will provide a better interface for this!</p>2.2 What Information Do You Collect About Me and Why?<p>\n<strong>The information we collect is purely for the purpose of providing your communication service via Matrix.\nWe do **</strong>not*<strong>* profile users or their data on the Service.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Be aware that while we do not profile users on the Service, third party Matrix clients may gather usage data.\nThe Element app (the Matrix client provided by Element) optionally gathers opt-in anonymised usage data in order to improve the app.\nThis data is retained for not longer than 13 months.\nFor more details on how your data is processed by Element, please review its privacy policy.</p>2.2.1 Information you provide to us:<p>We collect information about you when you input it into the Service or otherwise provide it directly to us.</p>2.2.1.1 Account and Profile Information<p>We collect information about you when you register for an account.\nThis information is kept to a minimum on purpose, and is restricted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Username</li>\n<li>Password</li>\n<li>Display Name (if you choose to provide one)</li>\n<li>Your email address (which we may mandate to mitigate abuse)</li>\n<li>Your verified telephone number (if you choose to provide it)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your username and password is used to authenticate your access to the Service and to uniquely identify you within the Service.</p>\n<p>Your password is stored until you change it or your account is deactivated (see 2.5 for details on how passwords are handled securely).\nYour username is stored indefinitely to avoid account recycling.</p>\n<p>Your email address is used for account verification purposes.\nYou can delete your email from your account after you have registered and verified, if you so wish.\nAlternatively, your email address may be used for the purposes described below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will also use your email address to let you reset your password if you forget it, and to optionally send you notifications about missed messages from users trying to contact you on Matrix;</li>\n<li>We may also send you infrequent urgent messages about platform updates.</li>\n</ul>2.2.1.2 Content you provide through using the Service<p>We store and distribute the messages and files you share using the Service (and across the wider Matrix ecosystem via federation) as described by the Matrix protocol and according to the access rules configured within the system.\n<strong>Storing and sharing this content is the reason the Service exists.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This content includes any information about yourself that you choose to share.</p>2.2.1.3 Information you provide through purchases in the Matrix Foundation Shop<p>The Matrix.org Shop is an online store at which you can purchase Matrix.org-branded merchandise, such as stickers or tee-shirts.\nAll proceeds go to The Matrix.org Foundation.\nData you provide for this purpose is processed under Performance of Contract.\nThis means that we process your data for the purposes of fulfilling orders you make from us, getting in touch with you, responding to your requests, working with our suppliers to deliver the Service and enabling its features, ensuring the security of our Service, developing, fixing and improving our Service, administering our business and complying with the law.</p>\n<p>The information we collect is purely for the purpose of taking payments for merchandise and shipping your purchases to you.\nWe do <strong>not</strong> profile users or their data on the Service.</p>We may need your personal information to establish, bring or defend legal claims.\nFor this purpose, we will retain your personal information for the statutory recommended 7 years after the date it is no longer needed by us for any of the purposes listed under How we use your information above<strong>.</strong>2.2.1.3.1 Information you provide to us:<p>We collect information about you when you input it into the Service or otherwise provide it directly to us.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name and contact details</li>\n<li>Delivery address</li>\n<li>Purchase information</li>\n<li>Payment details (handled by a third party provider, not visible to Matrix.org Foundation employees)</li>\n</ul>2.2.1.3.2 Information we collect automatically as you use the service:<p>Your IP address is logged when you access the Service.\nThis data is used in order to mitigate abuse and debug operational issues.\nOur logs are kept for not longer than 180 days.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2.1.3.3 Third-parties</strong>\n</p>BigCartel<p>We have selected BigCartel to provide our shopfront.\nBy purchasing from our shop, the following details will be shared with BigCartel:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your purchase details</li>\n<li>Your name and contact details</li>\n<li>Your delivery address</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is BigCartel's Privacy Policy</p>Stripe<p>We use Stripe to handle payment processing.\nBy purchasing from our shop, the following details will be shared with Stripe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your payment details</li>\n<li>Your purchase value</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Stripe takes care of all payment processing, so The Matrix.org Foundation and its employees will never see your payment details.</p>\n<p>Here is Stripe's Privacy Policy</p>Royal Mail<p>We use Royal Mail Click &amp.\nDrop to generate shipping labels.\nBy purchasing from our shop, the following details will be shared with Royal Mail Click &amp.\nDrop:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your name and address</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is Royal Mail's Privacy Policy</p>2.2.2 Information we collect automatically as you use the Service:Device and Connection Information<p>Each device you use to access the Service is allocated a (user-configurable) identifier.\nWhen you access the Service, we record the device identifier, the IP address it used to connect, user agent, and the time at which it last connected to the service.</p>\n<p>This information is gathered to help you to manage your devices - you can view and manage the list of devices by connecting to the Service with a Matrix client such as the Element app.</p>\n<p>Currently, we log the IP addresses of everyone who accesses the Service.\nThis data is used in order to mitigate abuse, debug operational issues, and monitor traffic patterns.\nOur logs are kept for not longer than 180 days.\nOnce Matrix is out of beta we will consider implementing log minimisation.</p>2.3 What Information is Shared With Third Parties and Why?2.3.1 Sharing Data with Connected Services<p>We may share your information when working with our suppliers in order to provide the Service.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Matrix.org homeserver is a <em>decentralised</em> and <em>open</em> service.\nThis means that, to support communication between users on different homeservers or different messaging platforms, your username, display name and messages and files are sometimes shared with other services that are connected with the Matrix.org homeserver.</p>2.3.1.1 Federation<p>Matrix homeservers share user data with the wider ecosystem over federation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you send messages or files in a room, a copy of the data is sent to all participants in the room, including (depending on room settings) participants who join the room in future.\nIf these participants are on remote homeservers, your username, display name, messages and files may be replicated across each participating homeserver.</li>\n<li>We will forget your copy of your data upon your request.\nWe will also forward your request to be forgotten onto federated homeservers.\nHowever - these homeservers are outside our span of control, so we cannot guarantee they will forget your data.</li>\n<li>Federated homeservers can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Access control settings are shared between homeservers, as well as any requests to remove messages by \"redactions\", or remove personal data under GDPR Article 17 <em>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)</em>.\nFederated homeservers and Matrix clients which respect the Matrix protocol are expected to honour these controls and redaction/erasure requests, but other federated homeservers are outside of the span of control of Element, and we cannot guarantee how this data will be processed.\nFederated homeservers can also be located in any territory, and will be subject to the local regulations of that territory.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3.1.2 Bridging</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some Matrix rooms are bridged to third-party services, such as IRC networks, Twitter or email.\nWhen a room has been bridged, your username, display name, messages and file transfers may be duplicated on the bridged service where supported.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It may not be technically possible to support your management of your data once it has been copied onto a bridged service.</li>\n<li>Bridged services can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and regulations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Access control settings, requests to remove messages by \"redactions\" or remove personal data under GDPR Article 17 <em>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)</em> are shared to bridging services, which are expected to honour them to the best of their ability.\nBe aware that not all bridged networks or bridges support the necessary technical capabilities to limit, remove or erase messages.\nIf this is not acceptable to you, please do not use bridged rooms.</p>Integration Services (Bots and Widgets)<p>The Matrix.org homeserver provides a range of integrations in the form of Widgets (miniature web applications accessed as part of a Matrix Client) and Bots (automated participants in rooms).\nBots and Widgets currently have access to all the messages and files in any room in which they participate, although we are adding a more sophisticated access control system.</p>Transfers of your Data<p>If you use our Service your data will be transferred outside of the EU to other homeservers and services connected with matrix.org as this is necessary to provide the Service to you.\nBy the very nature of our Service, such transfers will occur regularly and we have no control over the safeguards adopted by third party recipients.</p>\n<p>Where we engage suppliers to process your data outside the EU we will ensure that appropriate safeguards such as the standard contractual clauses are in place.</p>2.4 Sharing Data in Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws.\nEnforcement of Our Rights<p>In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to</p>\n<p>(a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,</p>\n<p>(b) protect the security or integrity of our products and services (e.g.\nfor a security audit),</p>\n<p>(c) protect Element and our users from harm or illegal activities, or</p>\n<p>(d) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the serious bodily harm of any person.</p>2.5 How Do You Handle Passwords?<p>We never store password data in plain text.\ninstead they are stored hashed (with at least 4096 rounds of bcrypt, including both a salt and a server-side pepper secret).\nPasswords sent to the server are encrypted using SSL.</p>\n<p>It is your sole responsibility to keep your user name, password and other sensitive information confidential.\nActions taken using your credentials shall be deemed to be actions taken by you, with all consequences including service termination, civil and criminal penalties.</p>\n<p>If you become aware of any unauthorised use of your account or any other breach of security, you must notify Element immediately by sending an email to security@matrix.org.\nSuspicious devices can be deleted using the User Settings management tools in a Matrix client such as https://riot.im/app, and users should manage good password hygiene (e.g.\nusing a password manager) and change their password if they believe their account is compromised.</p>\n<p>If you forget your password (and you have registered an email address) you can use the password reset facility to reset it.</p>\n<p>You can manage your account by using a Matrix client such as https://element.io/app</p>\n<p>We will never change a password for you.</p>2.6 Our Commitment to Children's Privacy<p>We never knowingly collect or maintain information in the Service from those we know are under 16, and no part of the Service is structured to attract anyone under 16.\nIf you are under 16, please do not use the Service.</p>2.7 How Can I Access or Correct My Information?<p>You can access all that we collect about you by using any compatible Matrix client (such as https://element.io/app) and managing your User Settings.\nYou can download a copy of all your data as per section 2.1.3.</p>2.8 Who Can See My Messages and Files?<p>In unencrypted and encrypted rooms, users connecting to the Matrix.org homeserver (directly or over federation) will be able to see messages and files according to the access permissions configuration of the relevant room.\nThis data is stored in the format it was received on our servers, and can be viewed by New Vector engineers (employees and contractors) under the conditions outlined below.</p>\n<p>In encrypted rooms, the data is stored in our databases but the encryption keys are stored only on your devices or by yourself.\nUsers can optionally backup an encrypted copy of their keys on the Service to aid recovery if they lose all their keys and devices.\nThis key backup is encrypted by a recovery key that only the user has access to.\nThis means that nobody, even Element engineers (employees and contractors) can see your message content in our database, and if you lose access to your encryption keys you lose access to your messages forever.</p>\n<p>We use HTTPS to transfer all data.\nEnd-to-end encrypted messaging data is stored encrypted using AES-256, using message keys generated using the Olm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets.</p>2.9 What Are the Guidelines Element Follows When Accessing My Data?<ul>\n<li>We

to prevent unauthorised access to user data;</li>\n<li>We never share what we see with other users or the general public.</li>\n</ul>2.10 Who Else Has Access to My Data?<p>We host the majority of the Service in UpCloud data centres.\nHere's UpCloud's privacy policy.\nUpCloud controls physical access to their locations.</p>\n<p>We host some Services in Mythic Beasts data centres.\nHere\u2019s

business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</p>\n<p>If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by us about our users will be one of the transferred assets.</p>2.12 How Is My Data Protected from Another User's Data?<p>All of our users' data for the Service currently resides in the same database cluster which is due to the nature of our Service.\nWe use software best practices to guarantee that only people who you designate as viewers of your data can access it.\nIn other words, we segment our user data via software.\nWe do our best and are very confident we're doing a good job at it, but, like every other service that hosts their user data on the same database, we cannot guarantee that it is immune to a sophisticated attack.</p>2.13 What Should I Do If I Find a Security Vulnerability in the Service?<p>If you have discovered a security concern, please email us at security@matrix.org.\nWe'll work with you to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern.\nWe consider correspondence sent to security@matrix.org our highest priority, and work to address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Please act in good faith towards our users' privacy and data during your disclosure.\nWhite hat security researchers are always appreciated.</p>3.\nMaking a Complaint<p>We try to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal information.\nFor this reason, we take any complaints we receive about this very seriously.\nWe encourage people to bring it to our attention at dpo@matrix.org if they think that our collection or use of information is unfair, misleading or inappropriate.\nWe would also welcome any suggestions for improving our procedures.</p>\n<p>If you want to make a complaint about the way we have processed your personal information to the supervisory authority, you can

Terms and Conditions<p>Please read this document carefully before accessing or using this service!</p>1.\nIntroduction1.1 English, Not Legalese<p>Most Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable.\nThey are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.</p>\n<p>We decided to use plain English as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible.\nSome sections still have room for improvement - we plan to tackle these over time.</p>\n<p>When you read \u2018the matrix.org homeserver\u2019 or \u2018the Service\u2019 below, it refers to the services made available at <strong>matrix.org</strong> which store your account and personal conversation history, provide services such as bots and bridges, and communicate via the open Matrix decentralised communication protocol with the public Matrix Network.</p>\n<p>Where you read <em>New Vector</em>, <em>New Vector Ltd.</em> or <em>we </em>or<em> us</em> below, it refers to the company we created in July 2017 to hire the Matrix core team and support Matrix\u2019s development and so run the matrix.org homeserver: New Vector Ltd., and its French subsidiary: New Vector SARL and their agents.\n<strong>This agreement does not apply to Matrix servers run by anyone else - Matrix is an open network like the Web and this agreement only applies to the server (matrix.org) provided by New Vector Ltd.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If this agreement is not acceptable, please use a Matrix server provided by someone else!</p>\n<p>Contact Information:</p>\n<p>Email: support@matrix.org</p>\n<p>Postal

whether you are accessing content federated from the matrix.org homeserver to another Matrix homeserver, or are just browsing rooms as an unauthenticated guest, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.</p>\n<p>If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, please use a Matrix server provided by someone else and refrain from accessing content federated from this server.</p>1.3 This Is a Living Document<p>This is a living document.\nWith your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.</p>\n<p>If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We\u2019re all ears! Email support@matrix.org and we\u2019ll chat.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t amend this document for any specific users or use case, but if your proposed changes apply to all of our users, we\u2019ll be happy to update it for everyone.\nScroll to the bottom to see the history so far.</p>\n<p>We will likely improve this document over time.\nBy continuing to use the Service, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.</p>\n<p>Your access and use of the Service is always subject to the most current version of this document.</p>1.4 Breach of Terms<p>If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use the Service automatically terminates.\n</p>\n<p>We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Service at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.\n</p>\n<p>If you think we removed your access by mistake, send an email to support@matrix.org and we\u2019ll give you our reasoning.</p>2.\nSupport<p>Support for the matrix.org homeserver is provided on a best effort basis by New Vector Ltd - however, support is often available from the wider Matrix Community in the public Matrix Support rooms (as listed in the +matrix:matrix.org community).</p>\n<p>Queries sent to support@matrix.org will be addressed on a best-effort basis by the paid team.\nPhone support is not provided.</p>\n<p>We love Matrix and will support our users as much as we can, but we are also a small team and value our work/life balance.\nThis means that although we\u2019ll try our best, we do not provide 24/7 support.</p>3.\nIntellectual Property Rights<p>\n<em>Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads like legalese - this will be improved in later revisions of this document.</em>\n</p>3.1 Who Owns the IP of My Messages and Files?<p>We do not claim intellectual property rights over rooms, message content or files uploaded to the

objectionable.</p>4.\nReliability4.1 Do You Guarantee That The Service Will Be Accessible at All Times?<p>In short, we do not.\nLike all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet.\nWe do not offer contracted SLA for availability of the Service and your data.</p>\n<p>We monitor the Service closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email, push notifications and phone calls) when the matrix.org homeserver is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that New Vector Ltd.\nshall not be liable for any failure to store your materials on the matrix.org homeserver at any time.</p>5.\nApp Developers<p>We encourage you to write software that uses the Matrix Protocol and interfaces with the Service! </p>\n<p>The Matrix Protocol and our implementation will change over time, and we may change or deprecate APIs or behaviour for any feature of the Service from time to time - it is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to or via our Service are compatible with then-current APIs for the Service.\nWe will always try to inform you of any changes with reasonable notice so you can adjust your Application, but we are under no obligation to do so.</p>\n<p>Provided that you comply with the terms of this Agreement and our policies and procedures, you may use the Service to execute Applications owned by you.\nYou are solely responsible for your Applications, including any data, text, images or content they contain.</p>6.\nPlay Nice Clauses<p>\n<em>Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads like legalese - this will be improved in later revisions

" Understand how your data is used <p> The Matrix protocol is designed with your privacy and data sovereignty in mind.\nBecause it is a decentralised, federated service with cryptographically-validated message integrity, there are a few important things to know before you use the Service.\n</p>\n<p> This Service (via the Matrix homeserver hosted at https://matrix.org) is run and managed by New Vector Ltd, the company formed in July 2017 to hire the Matrix core development team.\n</p> Federation <p> Services using the Matrix protocol rely on Matrix homeservers which share user data with the wider ecosystem over federation.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> When you send messages or files in a room, a copy of the data is sent to all participants in the room.\nIf these participants are registered on remote homeservers, your username, display name, messages and files may be replicated across each participating homeserver.\n</li>\n<li> We will forget your copy of your data upon your request.\nWe will also forward your request onto federated homeservers.\nHowever - these homeservers are outside our span of control, so we cannot guarantee they will forget your data.\n</li>\n<li> Federated homeservers can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and regulations.\n</li>\n</ul> Bridging <p> Some Matrix rooms are bridged to third-party services, such as IRC networks, twitter or email.\nWhen a room has been bridged, your messages and media may be copied onto the bridged service.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> It may not be technically possible to support your management of your data once it has been copied onto a bridged service.\n</li>\n<li> Bridged services can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and regulations.\n</li>\n</ul> Integration Services (Bots and Widgets) <p> The matrix.org homeserver provides a range of integrations in the form of Widgets (web applications accessed as part of the Matrix Client webapp) and Bots (automated participants in rooms).\nBots and Widgets have access to the messages and files in rooms in which they participate.\n</p> Forgetting your Data <p> You can request that we forget your data if you deactivate your account.\nEach user in a Matrix conversation receives their own copy of all messages and files in that conversation (similar to email), so we ensure data is forgotten by ensuring that your data is not shared further and is not visible to future users.\nOnce all users\u2019 copies have been forgotten the messages and files will be deleted from the matrix.org homeserver database.\nFor full details, please see the full privacy notice.\n</p>\n<p> If you remove (redact) a message, the message content will no longer be accessible to users.\nRedactions only remove message content, your display name and avatar - your username will still be visible.\nFederated homeservers and some matrix clients may not honour the redaction request.\n</p> Legal Basis for Processing <p> New Vector processes your data under Legitimate Interest.\nThis means that we process your data only as necessary to deliver the Service, and in a manner that you understand and expect.\n</p>\n<p> The Legitimate Interest of our Service is the provision of decentralised, openly-federated and (optionally) end-to-end encrypted communication services.\nThe processing of user data we undertake is necessary to provide the Service.\nThe nature of the Service and its implementation results in some caveats concerning this processing, particularly in terms of GDPR Article 17 Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten).\nWe believe these caveats are in line with the broader societal interests served by providing the Service.\nThese caveats are discussed in detail in the full privacy notice, but the most important restriction is that your username will still be publicly associated with rooms in which you have participated even if you deactivate your account and ask us to forget your data.\n</p>\n<p> In situations where the interests of the individual appear to be in conflict with the broader societal interests, we will seek to reconcile those differences in accordance with our policy.\n</p>\n<p> If any of the above are unacceptable to you, <b>please do not use the Service.</b>\n</p>\n<p> Please review the full privacy notice and code of conduct before using this Service.\n</p>\n<p> Please review the terms and conditions before using this Service.\n</p>\n<p> You must be at least 16 years old to use this Service (https://matrix.org)
