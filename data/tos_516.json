Resolution Summary: <p>Our customer-service department can resolve most customer concerns quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction.\nPlease contact us via email to legal@wb.com so that we may attempt to resolve the dispute informally.\n<strong>In the unlikely event that you're not satisfied with customer service's solution (or if Warner has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction</strong>.</p>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nUnless expressly limited by this Dispute Resolution provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\n<strong>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis.\nclass arbitrations and class actions are not permitted</strong>.\nFor any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration.\nMoreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to at least the same extent as you would be in court.</p>\n<p>In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), we will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator\u2019s award if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what we have offered you to settle the dispute.</p> ARBITRATION AGREEMENT <p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Claims Subject to Arbitration: <p>Warner and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims

only individualized relief, so long as the action remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\n<strong>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action</strong>.\nThis Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li> Pre-Arbitration Notice of Disputes: <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice to Warner should be sent by certified mail to: General Counsel, Warner Bros.\nEntertainment Inc., 4000 Warner Blvd., Burbank, CA 91522(\u201cNotice Address\u201d).\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d).</p>\n<p>If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by us or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or us is entitled.\nYou may download a form to initiate arbitration at: adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li> Arbitration Procedure: <p>The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), as modified by this arbitration provision, and will be administered by the AAA.\n(If the AAA is unavailable, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties or by the court.) The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration are for the court to decide.\nThe arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.\nUnless we and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nExcept as provided in subsection (F) below, the arbitrator can award the same damages and individualized relief that a court can award under applicable law.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li> Arbitration Fees: <p>After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000 in value.\n(The filing fee currently is $200 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.\nIf you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) We will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.\nIf, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously paid that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nIn addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at greater than $75,000 (either to you or to us), the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li> Alternative Payment: <p>If you initiated arbitration in accordance with the notice requirements above in subsection (B) and the arbitrator issues an award in your favor that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then we will pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 (\u201cthe alternative payment\u201d), whichever is greater.</p>\n<p>If we did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you will be entitled to receive the alternative payment if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.\nIn assessing whether an award that includes attorneys' fees or expenses is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer, the calculation shall include only the portion of the award representing attorneys' fees or expenses that you reasonably incurred pursuing the arbitration through the date of our settlement offer.</p>\n<p>Although under some laws we may have a right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if we prevail in an arbitration, we agree that we will not seek such an award.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li> Requirement of Individual Arbitration: <p>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\n<strong>YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING</strong>.\nFurther, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding.\nIf, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief.\nclass, representative, and private attorney general claims.\nand consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then that claim or request for relief shall be severed , and all other claims and requests for relief shall be arbitrated.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li> Future Changes to Arbitration Provision: <p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) following your use of this Service, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the arbitration Notice Address provided above.\nBy rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> General Terms <ol>\n<li>\n<em>Governing Law and
