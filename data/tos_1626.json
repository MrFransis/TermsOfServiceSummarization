tool from Get Real Health that lets you gather, edit, store and share health data online.\nThe Service is intended for you to store your personal health-related information.\nYou may also be able to access information about other people (such as your family) with their consent and invitation.\nService accounts are not for use by healthcare providers or for any other commercial or non-personal purpose.\nThe Service is capable of providing personalized health guidance for you and your family.\nThe Service is hosted by Us using Microsoft Azure.\nYou should review Microsoft Azure\u2019s terms and conditions of use and privacy policy, which are available on Microsoft Azure\u2019s website.\nThe Service may assist you in assembling health information in a usable format.\nIt is important for you to understand how the information that you submit, review and edit in the Service is used by Us.\n</p>\n<p>The contents of the Service, such as text, graphics, images, personal health information, and other material contained in the Service and all information and data produced by the Service (\u201cContent\u201d) are for informational purposes only.\n&nbsp;The Content is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.\nThe information in your account may not always be accurate or up-to-date and should be viewed by any health care provider as informational only.\nThe Service does not hold records for healthcare providers or other medical or case management purposes.\nFor example, Service records may not be designated record sets as defined under U.S.\nregulations.\nIf a healthcare provider decides to include any data made available from the Service in its records, it should store a copy in its own system.\nIf there is a co-custodian of a record in your account (because one of you invited the other), you acknowledge that the co-custodian has full control over that record and may cancel your access to the record, manage the record is used.\nThe health information and guidance you will receive is automatically generated by the Service, based on information that you enter into or make available to the Service through your Service account.\n<b>This information is not reviewed by a physician, nurse, or other health care provider for your treatment purposes.\n&nbsp;Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.\n&nbsp;You agree that the Service and the information and guidance provided by the Service do not constitute the practice of medicine or any medical, nursing, or other professional health care advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</b> &nbsp;Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read when using the Service.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Signing in to Lydia and Creating an Account</b>\n</p>\n<p>To sign in to the Service, the Service uses a Microsoft authentication service.\nIf you close your Service account or lose your account credentials, you may not be able to access your data.\nBefore using the Microsoft authentication service, we recommend you review the security and privacy commitments offered by Microsoft.</p>\n<p>To create a new Service account, you must provide personal data such as name, date of birth, e-mail address, postal code, and country/region.\nDepending on which features you use, you may be asked for additional information.\nA Service account allows you to manage one or more health records, such as the ones you create for yourself and your family members.\nYou can add or remove data to a health record you manage at any time.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sharing Health Data</b>\n</p>\n<p>A key value of the Service is the ability you have to share your health data with people and services that can help you meet your health-related goals.\nBy default, you are the custodian of any records you create.\nCustodians have the highest level of access to a health record.\nAs a custodian, you can share data in a health record with another person by sending an e-mail invitation through the Service.\nYou can specify what type of access they have (including custodian access), how long they have access, and whether they can modify the data in the record.\nWhen you grant someone access, that person can grant the same level of access to someone else (for example, someone with view-only access can grant another user view-only access).\n<b>Because inappropriate granting of access could allow someone to violate your privacy or even revoke your access to your own records, you should be cautious about granting access to your records.</b>\n</p>\n<p>You can choose to share specific data (or all of the data) in a health record with other services, including participating third party services that you authorize (where available).\nNo service has access to your data through the Service unless an authorized user grants it access through the Service.\nThe Service allows you to control access by accepting or denying requests.\nFor each service granted access, you choose what health information in a specific health record to share and what actions each service may perform on the health information.</p>\n<p>A third party service that you authorize for a record will get the full name associated with your Service account, the nickname of the authorized record(s), and your relationship to that record.\nThe third party service will continue to have access through the Service until you revoke the permission.\nGet Real Health can revoke a third party service\u2019s access to the Service if it does not meet its privacy commitments to Get Real Health.\nHowever, except for applying the access permissions you have granted to third-party services, We do not control or monitor third-party services, and their privacy practices will vary.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Access and controls</b>\n</p>\n<p>You can review, edit, or delete your Service account data, or close your Service account at any time.\nOnly custodians can permanently delete an item.\nWhen you delete a heath record, it is also deleted for all users who had access to it.</p>\n<p>When you close your Service account, we delete all records for which you are the sole custodian.\nIf you share custodian access for a record, you can decide whether to delete the record.\nGet Real Health will wait a limited amount of time before permanently deleting your data in order to help avoid accidental or malicious removal of your health data.</p>\n<p>The Service maintains a full history of each access, change or deletion by users and services, which includes the date, action, and name of the person or service.\nCustodians of records can examine the history of those records.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Email communications</b>\n</p>\n<p>We will use the email address you provide to share invitations you send through the Service, and to send you service notifications, such as email notifications that information is available to add to your Service records.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Collection of Personal and Usage Information</b>\n</p>\n<p>Any data that you enter into the Service (\u201cPersonal Health Information\u201d or \u201cPersonal Information\u201d) is stored in a secure hosted environment.\n&nbsp;The secure hosted environment is located in The Netherlands.\nThe Service does not permanently store any of your data.\nThe Service uses the information that you authorize for access from your Service account to provide you with personalized health information.\n&nbsp;You can review and edit information contained in your Service account using the Patient Portal.\n</p>\n<p>The Service uses personal information collected from You and from CHBase\u2122, a proprietary data repository owned and operated by Us, including Personal Health Information, to provide the Service as described in this policy.\nGet Real Health does not access the Personal Health Information that is stored in the secure hosted environment without your prior permission (for example, for maintenance or support purposes) and is not accessible by third parties without your secret login password information.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may collect information about your interaction with the Service.\nFor example, we may use web site analytics tools the Service to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find the Service, the pages you view within the Service and your browser\u2019s width and height.\nWe also

Information is Stored</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Service stores or \u201ccaches\u201d Personal Information as necessary to provide you the Service.\n</p>\n<p>All of the Personal Information you enter, edit, delete or view in the Service is added to your CHBase account once you click on \u201cSave\u201d or another similar button.\n</p>\n<p>When you click the \u201cSave\u201d button, the cache of information used by the Service is also updated with the new information you added or changed.\nWhen you select that link, the Service updates all the information in the cache with the most current

particular country or region).\nThis aggregated information is not associated with any individual account.\nExcept as set forth in this statement, we will not share your Personal Information and Usage Information in personally identifiable form with any other party without your consent, unless we are required to do so (1) to comply with the law.\n(2) to prevent, report or investigate illegal activity.\nor (3) to protect Our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements).</p>\n<p>\n<b>HIPAA</b>\n</p>\n<p>Get Real Health is not a Healthcare Provider under the definitions
