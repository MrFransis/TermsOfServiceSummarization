is positioned at the Department of Treasury.&nbsp;</p> Privacy policy topics <ul>\n<li>Cookies on IRS.gov</li>\n<li>Report phishing</li>\n<li>Identity theft, fraud &amp.\nscams</li>\n<li>Privacy Impact Assessments</li>\n<li>Taxpayer Bill of Rights</li>\n</ul> Privacy Compliance Privacy and civil liberty impact assessments (PCLIA) <p>A PCLIA is a decision-making tool used to identify and mitigate privacy risks at the beginning of and throughout the development life cycle of a program or system.\nPCLIAs help the public understand what PII the agency is collecting, why it is being collected, and how it will be used, shared, accessed, secured and stored.\nThe PCLIA uses the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs) to assess and mitigate any impact on an individual\u2019s privacy.\nGenerally, a PCLIA is required before a program or system containing PII becomes operational.</p>\n<p>Generally,&nbsp;a PCLIA should accomplish these goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure conformance with applicable legal, regulatory, and policy requirements for privacy.</li>\n<li>Determine the risks and effects.</li>\n<li>Evaluate protections and alternative processes to mitigate potential privacy risks.</li>\n<li>Provide assurance to the public about the protection of privacy and constitutional rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Approved PCLIAs are published on the IRS's&nbsp;Privacy Impact Assessment page unless they are classified.</p> System of records notice (SORN) <p>A System of Records is a group of records under the control of any federal agency from which information is retrieved by a unique personal identifier assigned to an individual.\nA SORN is a formal notice to the public published in the Federal Register that identifies the purpose for which PII is collected, from whom and what type of PII is collected, how the PII is shared externally (routine uses), and how to access and correct any PII maintained by the department or agency.</p>\n<p>A SORN is required when a government agency has a system of records as defined above.\nIn some instances, the agency may have an existing SORN that covers a collection of systems or programs.</p>\n<p>All SORNs are approved by the agency\u2019s Chief Privacy Officer prior to publication and are sent to OMB and Congress for comment.&nbsp.\nAfter, they are published in the Federal Register for thirty days to give the public notice and time to comment.\nA program or system may not become operational until the SORN has been published for&nbsp;30 days.</p>\n<p>All IRS SORNs published in the Federal Register can be found on the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury System of Records Notices webpage.\nThere is a section labeled \u201cExemptions claimed for the system\u201d that lists any exemptions to the Privacy Act at the end of each SORN.</p> Computer matching agreements <p>A computer matching program is required by the Privacy Act for any computerized comparison of two or more automated systems of records, or a system of records with non-federal records, for establishing or verifying eligibility or compliance as it relates to cash or in-kind assistance or payments under federal benefit programs.</p>\n<p>Notices for approved computer matching programs are published in the Federal Register and can be found on the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury Computer Matching Programs webpage.\nThere are exemptions for computer matching agreements for internal systems used for tax administration purposes.</p> Publicly-available privacy reports <p>In accordance with Section 522 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, the Department of the Treasury prepares a report to Congress on an annual basis covering the Department\u2019s activities which affect privacy.&nbsp;These activities include complaints of privacy violations, implementation of section 552a of title 5, 11 United States Code, internal controls, as well as other relevant matters.&nbsp.\nA listing of all publicly available privacy reports can be found at the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury Privacy Act Annual Reports webpage.</p> Privacy Act implementation rules and exemptions <p>Information on IRS Privacy Act Implementation Rules can be found at the Federal Register Privacy Act Implementation for the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury.</p>\n<p>Exemptions to the Privacy Act can be found near the end of each individual SORN, in the \u201cExemptions claimed for the system,\u201d as well as in&nbsp;Treasury Regulation 31 CFR 1.36.</p> IRS Privacy Program Plan <p>Ensuring the IRS preserves and enhances public confidence by properly protecting, retaining and disclosing taxpayer information is the main purpose of the IRS Privacy Program Plan&nbsp;PDF.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The plan provides an overview of the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IRS\u2019s privacy protection responsibilities</li>\n<li>A description of the structure of the privacy program</li>\n<li>Resources dedicated to the privacy program</li>\n<li>Role of the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) and other privacy officials and staff</li>\n<li>Strategic goals and objectives of the privacy program</li>\n<li>Management controls in place or planned for meeting applicable privacy requirements and managing privacy risks</li>\n<li>Information necessary by the agency\u2019s privacy requirements</li>\n</ul> Privacy Act Requests Overview <p>\n<strong>Note: </strong>Federal tax records are exempt from access or&nbsp;amendment.\nTo amend a federal tax record, taxpayers must file Form 1040-X or follow IRS procedures for other changes, such as change of address.</p>\n<p>The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, provides safeguards against unwarranted invasions of privacy by establishing a code of \"fair information practices.\"&nbsp.\nThe principles, commonly referenced as the fair information practice principles (FIPPs), require agencies to comply with statutory norms for collection, maintenance, access, use, and dissemination of records.</p>\n<p>To increase transparency and assure notice to individuals, the Privacy Act requires agencies to publish in the Federal Register notice of modifications to or the creation of systems of records.\nThe term \"system of records\" means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.</p>\n<p>A current listing of the Department's System of Records, along with updated routine uses and claimed exemptions, can be found the on the Treasury Department's System of Records Notices page.</p>\n<p>To further protect the individual, the Privacy Act requires all records which are used by the agency in making any determination about any individual to be maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination.</p>\n<p>The Privacy Act grants individuals increased rights of access to records maintained about them, as well as the right to seek amendment of records maintained about them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>IRS offers routine access to other records through procedures designed to make access quick and easy.&nbsp;If you are working directly with an IRS employee on an open tax case, you can request information from the file directly from them.</p> How to write a Privacy Act request <ul>\n<li>Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) guidelines</li>\n</ul> Privacy Complaints What is a privacy
