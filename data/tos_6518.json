measures implemented by the data exporter in accordance with Clauses 4(d) and 5(c) (or document/legislation):</u>\n</p>\n<p>Description of the technical and organizational security measures implemented by the data exporter</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures with which Personal Data can be processed while denying physical access to IT systems for unauthorised persons (access control):</em>\n</p>\n<p>All of the data exporter\u2019s third-party data centers have strict policies for authorization of access into the facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nEach data center vendor has appropriate policies required by external audits.&nbsp.\nAll of the data exporter\u2019s internal personnel are vetted prior to allowing access to data centers.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures to hinder unauthorised persons from using IT systems and procedures (access control):</em>\n</p>\n<p>All systems level access is based on directory services and role based security.&nbsp.\nAdditional measures are in place such as VPN and other security measures prior to system level access being available, as described below.&nbsp.\nAll end user level access to AcuityAds\u2019 systems is based on role based security.&nbsp.\nShared accounts are not allowed.</p>\n<p>The data exporter undertakes the following actions, among others, to ensure that persons authorised to use the Acuity Platform or access data processing infrastructure can only access the data underlying their access authorization and that stored data or data undergoing processing cannot be read, copied, altered, or removed without authorization.</p>\n<p>The data exporter\u2019s employees access infrastructure components with unique accounts that require strong passwords.&nbsp.\nRemote administration is available only via public key cryptography and password based authentication is not permitted.&nbsp.\nAccess groups have been established to restrict access to only to specific areas that are required for employee responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Customers of the data exporter may be granted access to the AcuityAds console.&nbsp;Access to the AcuityAds console is limited via a user name and a password to the customer\u2019s authorised persons and additionally to equivalently authorised employees of the data exporter.&nbsp.\nLogical infrastructure configuration prevents the access of one customer\u2019s data by another customer.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures to enable persons authorised to use IT procedures to gain exclusive access to the Personal Data that are subject to their access authorisation (access control):</em>\n</p>\n<p>The data exporter employs a centralized access management system to control personnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a limited number of authorised personnel.\nThese mechanisms are designed to grant only approved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration information.\nThe data exporter requires the use of unique user IDs, strong passwords.\nand carefully monitored access lists to minimize the potential for unauthorised account use.\nThe granting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorised personnel\u2019s job responsibilities.\njob duty requirements necessary to perform authorised tasks.\na need to know basis.\nand must be in accordance with the data exporter\u2019s internal data access policies and training.\nApprovals are managed by workflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes.\nAccess to systems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability.\nWhere passwords are employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations), password policies that follow at least industry standard practices are implemented.\nThese standards include password expiry, restrictions on password reuse and sufficient password strength.</p>\n<p>In addition, the data exporter has implemented several security related policies that govern the use of AcuityAds technology and data including rules around acceptable use, data classification, information security, and passwords.&nbsp.\nThe data exporter\u2019s information security officer is Rachel Kapcan.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures to ensure that Personal Data cannot be read, copied, amended or removed by unauthorised persons when the data is transmitted electronically, or when it is being transported, or when it is being stored on data carriers but which allow checks to be made of the destinations targeted when transferring Personal Data using data transmission equipment (routing controls):</em>\n</p>\n<p>Data is encrypted by measures such as SSL.&nbsp.\nPersonal data shall not be transferred outside the scope as authorised under these Clauses, or as otherwise authorised by the data importer.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures that allow retrospective checks to be made on whether Personal Data has been entered into, amended or removed from IT systems, and by whom (input controls):</em>\n</p>\n<p>All data processed in Acuity Platform by an end user of the platform (e.g., CL personnel) is done on a permissions based model, all user accounts are enabled/disabled in accordance with the security policy.&nbsp.\nAll accounts are individual.\nShared accounts are not allowed.\nAudit Trail is kept for user actions and is logged.</p>\n<p>Email and corporate systems access is granted based on directory services and role based security.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures to ensure that Personal Data to be processed on CONTROLLER\u2019s behalf is only processed in accordance with CONTROLLER\u2019s directives (performance controls):</em>\n</p>\n<p>The data importer is a user of the Acuity Platform, therefore setting up of data collection mechanisms, collection of data, verifying data integrity sit with the data importer.\nThe personal data shall only be processed in the manner authorised under these Clauses and all sub processors shall only be employed in compliance with the provisions of these Clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures to ensure that Personal Data is protected against incidental damage or loss (availability controls):</em>\n</p>\n<p>Data is kept in a storage framework with at least three copies natively made and stored.\nAdditionally, the data exporter replicates data between data centers for disaster recovery with ability to restore if needed, although the data exporter will not replicate lat/long or other data points which might be considered sensitive in the EU.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures to ensure that the different purposes for processing data can be identified \u2013 especially for PROCESSOR\u2019s different controllers \u2013 and that data to be processed is processed separately from each other (separation controls):</em>\n</p>\n<p>AcuityAds stores data in a multi-tenant environment on servers owned by AcuityAds.\nThe Services database and file system architecture are replicated between multiple data centers.\nAcuityAds logically isolates data on a per end user basis at the application layer.\nAcuityAds logically separates Customer\u2019s data, including data from different end users, from each other, and data for an authenticated end user will not be displayed to another end user (unless the former end user or administrator allows the data to be shared).\nA central authentication system is used across all Services to increase uniform security of data.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures to ensure availability and resiliency for data and technical operations:</em>\n</p>\n<p>AcuityAds stores data and operates servers in datacenters with robust and redundant power and data storage mechanisms.\nAll deployments are configured with repeatable operating templates, for rapid deployment to a DR region when necessary.\nAll networks are protected by network firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and other industry best practice security measures.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures for regular testing, assessment and evaluation:</em>\n</p>\n<p>AcuityAds regularly reviews system activity rated by security threat level by our intrusion detection platform.\nAcuityAds regularly runs external network scans to ensure operating systems, libraries, and all used software is patched against vulnerabilities.\nAll platform configurations are catalogued within version control and issued via peer-reviewed pull requests to ensure multiple reviewers of each security related change.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Measures for pseudonymization of data:</em>\n</p>\n<p>AcuityAds works with upstream data controllers to ensure no PII enters our system.\nAny e-mail addresses are hashed prior to ingestion into the platform which would render them as pseudonymous personal data by the time they reach AcuityAds\u2019 systems.\nWhere AcuityAds acts to track activity with cookies, the platform will be disabling inbound traffic to our pixel collection from any IP address that the company determines is coming from the EU.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact

use it in relation to the service AcuityAds provides to its customers via our advertising technology platform.\nWho We Are AcuityAds (\u201cAcuityAds\u201d \u201cwe\u201d \u201cour\u201d) is a leading advertising company that provides a technology platform (the \u201cPlatform\u201d) for marketers, offering a powerful and holistic solution for digital advertising across all ad formats and devices to amplify reach and Share of Attention\u2122 throughout the customer journey.\nAcuityAds has developed a proprietary technology platform that enables marketers and agencies to effectively target consumers with digital advertising.\nMost of the internet is offered to users free of charge.\nWeb publishers are able to offer valuable content for free because they are supported by advertising.\nAcuityAds aims to create a better digital experience for web users by allowing advertisers to present relevant advertising content, rather than advertising that is unrelated to users\u2019 interests.\nAdvertisers also benefit because targeted advertising is more effective and better received.<br>\n<br> We offer this privacy policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) because we take your privacy seriously.\nThis Policy outlines our privacy practices with respect to the Acuity Platform.\nIf you want to understand AcuityAds\u2019 privacy practices with respect to our corporate website and information we collect from our customers, please visit our <strong>Corporate Privacy Policy.</strong>\n<br>\n<br> We are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adhere to its Codes of Conduct, as well as the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada\u2019s (DAAC) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.\nWe continuously improve our privacy safeguards in order to help protect information about your browsing activities.\nOverview of the types of data collected by AcuityAds\u2019 platform Personal Data The definitions of personal data vary depending on the laws where you are located.\nFor example, in the European Union (EU), Canada and the U.S.\nState of California, personal data is defined more broadly than in other places and would include both PII (e.g., email addresses and phone numbers) and Pseudonymous Identifiers (defined below).\nIn California, it is sometimes referred to as personal information.\nAcuityAds will explain the different types of personal data and personal information below, and will try to be clear when we\u2019re describing our use of each throughout this Policy.\nAcuity does not knowingly place PII on our advertising Platform, but we do process Pseudonymous Information via the Platform.\nPseudonymous Identifiers AcuityAds also collects pseudonymous identifiers.\nPseudonymous Identifiers help our Platform recognize a particular browser or device, but it doesn\u2019t enable us to know your identity as a natural person.\nThis information helps us collect and make use of other personal data to better understand your interests and preferences.\nThe pseudonymous identifiers include Google Advertising ID, Apple Identifier for Advertisers, Acuity ID and IP address.\nPrivacy practices for our technology platform The Acuity Platform processes data collected across non-affiliated websites and mobile applications pursuant to serving advertisements on behalf of our Clients who are generally businesses seeking to market a product or service.\nWe obtain this information from website and mobile application publishers, connected television devices, advertising exchanges, supply side platforms and other companies which help AcuityAds place bids on ad slots on behalf of our advertisers.\nWe obtain information using one or more of the following tracking techniques or technologies, which are all widely used across the Internet: Cookies A cookie is a small data file stored on your device.\nIn the context of our Platform the AcuityAds cookie often contains a Pseudonymous Identifier that is assigned to your browser the first time it is seen by our Platform.\nOn subsequent interactions with our Platform, we use this Pseudonymous Identifier to, among other things, recognize what advertisements your browser has interacted with previously.\nOur cookies are not used to identify you personally, cannot be used to install malware, viruses or any other harmful software and they cannot access any confidential data on your computer.\nFor more information about cookies in general, please visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.\nPixels Pixels (also known as web beacons) are tiny images embedded in a web page that allow our Platform to infer that you\u2019ve seen on that web page.\nThey also allow us to create, update and read our own cookies.\nAdvertising IDs An Advertising ID (device identification) is another Pseudonymous Identifier associated with a smartphone or similar handheld device.\nAdvertising IDs are accessible by mobile application publishers and can be passed to AcuityAds with an ad request.\nThese Advertising IDs do not enable AcuityAds to identify individuals, but rather can be used to help us run advertising campaigns.\nThey can be used to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same device, and to track a device to show that the device interacted with an ad (i.e.\n\u201cclicked\u201d on it, watched a video ad, or downloaded an application as a result of an advertisement).\nThe information we collect via the platform Using the technologies described above, we collect and use Pseudonymous Identifiers.\nPseudonymous Identifiers are considered personal data in some places like the EU and Canada but they do not allow us to identify you personally.\nTheir primary use for AcuityAds is to help us serve users more relevant ads, count the number of ads served and to understand how you and other Internet users interact with ads.\nThis information is collected when you visit the website or mobile application where one of our ads are served.\nThe Platform collects information about your browser type, operating system, device, and the unique identifier assigned to your device.\nDemographic data such as age range, income level or gender may be collected.\nIn addition, we collect information about your web browsing and app usage, such as the date and time you visited one of our partner\u2019s websites or apps, pages of such websites or apps that you visit, the names or types of mobile apps that you visit, and other data such as page visits, ads shown, ads clicked and conversions over multiple non-affiliated websites and mobile apps for the purpose of creating interest segments to tailor advertising and content is sometimes referred to as \u201cInterest Based Advertising\u201d or \u201cIBA.\u201d We engage in IBA via the Platform.\nWhere we are able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular computer or device belongs to the same user or household as another computer or device, we may link those computers and/or devices with each other.\nWhere we are able to make such inferences, we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across multiple computers or devices.\nThis is sometimes referred to as cross-device advertising, and we generally don\u2019t conduct cross-device advertising on computers or devices located in the EU.\nWe also use other targeting techniques such as leveraging data received by Clients once it is rendered pseudonymous via a privacy-safe third-party service provider.\nSome of the transfers of Pseudonymous Identifiers and other pseudonymous information from The Platform over the past 12 months may be considered a sale under California law.<br>\n<br> We do not use the Platform to collect PII such as your name, postal address, phone number, or email address.\nAnd we don\u2019t collect sensitive information such as social security number or credit card number via the Platform.\nThe data we collect is primarily used to understand your online activity and consequentially provide you with relevant advertisements based on the websites you\u2019ve visited, mobile applications you\u2019ve used and similar data provided by our Clients and third-party data partners.<br>\n<br> The information we collect is used to deliver personalized advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of the ads.\n<br>\n<br> AcuityAds may also collect data that can be used by our Clients and partners and receive certain data from Clients and partners.\nThis data may include whether or not you have visited our Client\u2019s website and/or mobile app, or if you have used a website and/or app that our Client advertises on.\nThe data collected is used to build a consumer profile.\nWe use the data in our algorithm to better understand your interactions online and to pair the right advertisements with the right consumers.\nWith this information we can deliver you more personalized advertisements.\nPotentially sensitive information pertaining to children &amp.\nhealth conditions AcuityAds does not intentionally or knowingly collect information from children under 16 years of age, and does not tailor any segments to children under 16 years of age.<br>\n<br> We do not collect any information regarding specific health conditions that we consider sensitive.\nFor a full list of AcuityAds\u2019 proprietary health-related segments, click here.\nAcuityAds may also utilize health-related targeting data segments provided by third party data companies, but don\u2019t consider any of those segments to be sensitive.\nWe don\u2019t currently use such third party data when serving ads to EU data subjects.\nData Retention AcuityAds retains the web log data for a maximum of 180 days, although we generally don\u2019t retain this data for EU data subjects for more than a few days.\nAfter 180 days, we aggregate the log data so that it does not identify any individual device and retain the aggregate data for up to three years.\nOur cookies are set to expire before one year.\nthis expiration date updates every time you encounter our server.\nSecurity AcuityAds takes reasonable measures to help protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nThis includes but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption.\nNo method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.\ntherefore, while the company strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, it cannot guarantee absolute security.\nChoice Mechanism: Objecting to processing, opting out Many Internet users enjoy receiving relevant advertisements.\nOur algorithm reads your online data and aims to deliver you the most relevant advertising content available.\nThis results in you only seeing ads that match your inferred interests.\nWithout targeted advertising, marketers do not know your consumer preferences and will likely deliver you ads that you are uninterested in.<br>\n<br> It is also important to consider that the websites you use receive substantial payments from marketers to present interest based ads.\nThese increased revenues can improve website content and pass on a reciprocal benefit to you, as the user.\nWithout these revenue websites are more likely to deliver lesser value content.\nAcuityAds has evaluated the benefits of the targeted ads served by our platform against the potential risks to data protection rights and concluded that it is in our legitimate interest to process data via the Platform.\nBrowser based choice mechanisms If you prefer not to receive targeted advertising from AcuityAds, you can object to our processing of browser data by the Platform by clicking here, by visiting the NAI website here, by going to the DAA website , the DAAC website here, or the EDAA website here.\nCalifornia data subjects may opt-out of the \u201csale\u201d of their personal information by clicking the above links.\nAlso, where we receive a request to opt-out of your sale of personal information from a publisher, or SSP we will apply that opt-out request as well.\nIf you opt-out from that processing, AcuityAds will set a cookie on your browser that tells AcuityAds not to tailor ads to your interests \u2013 including IBA and cross-device ads.\nOpting out does not mean you will not be served an ad by AcuityAds, but the ads we serve will be less relevant to your interests.\nPlease note that the opt-out cookie only applies to the computer and browser where it is set.\nAlso, if you delete the opt-out cookie (such as by clearing all cookies on your browser), you will need to renew your opt-out choice.\nEU data subjects receive additional rights as described below.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>To better understand the process of behavioral advertising, please visit:</strong>\n<br> Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d) \u2013 www.networkadvertising.org<br> Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) \u2013 www.aboutads.info<br> Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (\u201cDAAC\u201d) \u2013 www.youradchoices.ca<br> European Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cEDAA\u201d) \u2013 https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ Mobile choice mechanism Opting out on a mobile device:<br> If you are using a mobile device and would like to opt-out of interest-based advertising then please follow this link for instructions on how to opt out across multiple mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android.\nPlease note that the opt-out process is different for each mobile operating system.<br>\n<br> If you reject processing via one of these methods, one of the mobile operating systems will set a cookie on your browser that tells AcuityAds not to tailor ads to your interests \u2013 including IBA ads and cross-device ads.\nOpting out does not mean you will not be served an ad by AcuityAds, but the ads we serve will be less relevant to your interests.\nEU data subjects receive additional rights as described below.\nDisclosure, Onward Transfer We contract with a select group of third-party processors and service providers such as networking and storage providers to allow them to carry out their services for us.\nOther third-party service providers used by Acuity include: a) outsourced computer programmers helping ensure our systems are operating properly.\nb) email marketing providers, c) website and b2b sales analytics providers, d) customer relationship management, contact database vendors, data hygiene vendors, survey vendors and project management software providers, e) customer billing systems partners, f) login authentication providers to ensure that the logins to our systems are working efficiently, g) social media platforms for advertising and marketing purposes, h) auditing, debugging and security vendors.\nThose processors and service providers are contractually obligated to process data only as instructed by AcuityAds.<br>\n<br> Please take note of the following exceptional situations: AcuityAds may be required to disclose information to third parties when obligated to do so by law and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including transfer reasonably intended to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.\nIn the event that AcuityAds sells, merges or transfers all or part of its business, we may transfer visitor information to a third party as part of that transaction.\nDo Not Track A number of industry groups are attempting to develop a Do Not Track (DNT) standard.\nCurrently, the standards regarding the DNT signals and appropriate responses are not consistently defined.\nWhere we can ascertain that a browser being used by a California data subject has enacted DNT, we treat that user as having opted out from AcuityAds\u2019 sale of their personal information.\nAccessing, Changing, Removing Information If you\u2019re located in the EU or California, scroll down to see any the data subject access rights which are available to you with respect to the Acuity Platform.\nCalifornia Data Subjects Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides additional privacy protections for California data subjects and users, including: a) the right to see what data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to know), b) the right to delete the data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to delete) and c) the right to opt-out of the sale of data about you, your computer or device to certain third parties (i.e., the right to opt-out from sales of your information).\nWe do not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the above rights.\nMoreover, we may not be able to honor a right if doing so would violate applicable law.<br>\n<br> The CCPA defines personal information broadly and as such, it includes pseudonymous identifiers such as cookie IDs and mobile advertising IDs.\nYou may access those rights with respect to AcuityAds by sending us an email to privacy@acuityads.com, by calling our California privacy help line at 1-866-6Acuity, or by visiting our data subject access page here.\nAs a California data subject, if you make a subject access request as set out in this policy, you are entitled to see and delete the personal information that we have about you.\nWe will confirm your request within 10 days and make a good faith attempt to fulfill your request within 45 days.\nEuropean Data Subjects The General Data Privacy Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) affords additional rights to EU data subjects.\nThose rights include the right to complain to EU Supervisory Authorities and the right to access, correct and delete certain personal data processed by AcuityAds.<br>\n<br> As described above, with respect to EU data subjects, personal data includes Pseudonymous Identifiers such as an IP address, a mobile advertising ID or a cookie ID.\nWhere AcuityAds is a controller of data (e.g.\nvia our Platform), the legal basis will be both legitimate interest and consent in accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR and depending on the type of information subject to processing and the information we receive from upstream partners.\nWhere we rely upon legitimate interest, we have assessed the processing is not high risk and will not violate fundamental human rights.\nWe process personal data of clients and partners for the performance of our contracts with them in accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR.<br>\n<br> Where AcuityAds receives from an EU data subject a request to cease processing of data via one of the choice mechanisms listed above, AcuityAds will stop all data processing with respect to the opted out browser or device unless such processing is required by law.<br>\n<br> If you believe AcuityAds is processing one of your Pseudonymous Identifiers and wish to exercise your right to access, delete, port or remove such information, please click here to visit our EU data subject access request page.<br>\n<br> For all requests concerning the security of your data, please contact our data protection officer at privacy@acuityads.com.<br>\n<br> If you have a particularly sensitive request, please contact our data protection officer by postal mail, as communication by e-mail can always be flawed by security vulnerabilities.\nRevisions AcuityAds reserves the right to revise its policies and practices periodically.\nIf you would like to keep up to date, please visit this page to find out about any changes.\nWe will post any updates as well as their effective dates on this webpage.\nContacting us If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please contact us:<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Tal Hayek,

Corporate Privacy Policy Effective Date: January 22, 2020 TThis privacy policy outlines what information we collect, how we secure it, and how we use it in relation to operating the AcuityAds website and how manage the business relationships between AcuityAds and our customers.\nWho We Are AcuityAds (\u201cAcuityAds\u201d \u201cwe\u201d \u201cour\u201d) is a leading advertising company that provides a technology platform (the \u201cPlatform\u201d) for marketers, offering a powerful and holistic solution for digital advertising across all ad formats and devices to amplify reach and Share of Attention\u2122 throughout the customer journey.\nAcuityAds has developed a proprietary technology platform that enables marketers and agencies to effectively target consumers with digital advertising.\nMost of the internet is offered to users free of charge.\nWeb publishers are able to offer valuable content for free because they are supported by advertising.\nAcuityAds aims to create a better digital experience for web users by allowing advertisers to present relevant advertising content, rather than advertising that is unrelated to users\u2019 interests.\nAdvertisers also benefit because targeted advertising is more effective and better received.<br>\n<br> We offer this privacy policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) because we take your privacy seriously.\nThis Policy outlines our privacy practices with respect to our corporate website at https://www.acuityads.com/ (the \u201cWebsite\u201d) as well as the types of information we collect from our current and prospective advertising clients (our \u201cClients\u201d).\nIf you want to understand AcuityAds\u2019 privacy practices with respect to our Advertising Platform, please visit our Technology Privacy Policy.\n<br>\n<br> We are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and adhere to its Codes of Conduct, as well as the Digitals Advertising Alliance (DAA) and the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada\u2019s (DAAC) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.\nOverview of the types of data collected by AcuityAds\u2019 platform Personal Data AcuityAds collects personal data in the course of our business.\nThe definitions of personal data vary depending on the laws where you are located.\nFor example, in the European Union (EU), Canada and the U.S.\nState of California, personal data is defined more broadly than in other places and would include both PII and Pseudonymous Identifiers (defined below).\nIn California, it is sometimes referred to as personal information.\nAcuityAds will explain the different types of personal data and personal information below, and will try to be clear when we\u2019re describing our use of each throughout this Policy.\nPersonally Identifiable Information AcuityAds collects personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) when you choose to provide it to us.\nPII is any information that specifically identifies or locates a particular person or entity.\nWe receive and store any PII you provide to us.\nThe types of PII collected may include your name, postal address, telephone number, and email address.\nFor example, you may choose to send PII about yourself in an email, by completing an online form on our Website, or by signing up for our service or e-newsletter.\nYou may also provide us

contact you to respond to your inquiry, to provide the service requested or to maintain your account with us.\nPseudonymous Identifiers AcuityAds also collects pseudonymous identifiers on the Website.\nPseudonymous Identifiers help our Website recognize a particular browser or device, but it doesn\u2019t enable us to know your identity as a natural person.\nThis information helps us collect and make use of other personal data to help the Website function and to allow us to conduct analytics to better understand who is utilizing the Website without needed to know their real world identity.\nPrivacy practices for our website AcuityAds collects PII from our Website when you choose to provide it to us.\nFor example, you may choose to send PII about yourself in an email, or by completing a form on the Website.\nAcuityAds uses this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry.\nOnce collected, AcuityAds will store your PII for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes.<br>\n<br> AcuityAds also collects Pseudonymous Identifiers from visitors to this Website such as a cookie ID and IP address.\nWe also collect information about the pages viewed on

individual browser level.\nFor more information about cookies, please visit DATA RETENTION AcuityAds retains the web log data collected via the Website for a maximum of 180 days, although we generally don\u2019t retain this data for EU data subjects for more than a few days.\nAfter 180 days, we aggregate the log data so that it does not identify any individual device and retain the aggregate data for up to three years.\nOur cookies are set to expire before one year.\nthis expiration date updates every time you encounter our server.\nSECURITY AcuityAds takes reasonable measures to help protect the information we collect from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nThis includes but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption.\nNo method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.\ntherefore, while the company strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, it

www.networkadvertising.org<br> Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) \u2013 www.aboutads.info<br> Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (\u201cDAAC\u201d) \u2013 www.youradchoices.ca<br> European Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cEDAA\u201d) \u2013 https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ DISCLOSURE, ONWARD TRANSFER We contract with a select group of third-party processors and service providers such as networking and storage providers to allow them to carry out their services for us.\nOther third-party service providers used by Acuity include: a) outsourced computer programmers helping ensure our systems are operating properly.\nb) email marketing providers, c) website and b2b sales analytics providers, d) customer relationship management, contact database vendors, data hygiene vendors, survey vendors and project management software providers, e) customer billing systems partners, f) login authentication providers to ensure that the logins to our systems are working efficiently, g) social media platforms for advertising and marketing purposes, h) auditing, debugging and security vendors.\nThose processors and service providers are contractually obligated to process data only as instructed by AcuityAds.\nPlease take note of the following exceptional situations: AcuityAds may be required to disclose information to third parties when obligated to do so by law and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected, or actual prohibited activities, including transfer reasonably intended to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, including but not limited to fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.\nIn the event that AcuityAds sells, merges or transfers all or part of its business, we may transfer visitor information to a third party as part of that transaction.\nDO NOT TRACK A number of industry groups are attempting to develop a Do Not Track (DNT) standard.\nCurrently, the standards regarding the DNT signals and appropriate responses are not consistently defined.\nWhere we can ascertain that a browser being used by a California data subject has enacted DNT, we treat that user as having opted out from AcuityAds\u2019 sale of their personal information.\nAccessing, Changing, Removing Information If you believe we have PII about you (e.g.\nbecause you\u2019re a current or former Client, or you provided PII to receive AcuityAds\u2019 e-newsletters) and you would like to change, suppress or otherwise limit our use of that PII, you may contact us by sending an email containing your request to privacy@acuityads.com.\nFor your protection, we will only implement such requests with respect to the PII associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity and/or obtain more information from you before implementing your request.\nIf you\u2019re located in the EU or California, scroll down to see any additional rights you may have.\nCalifornia Data Subjects Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides additional privacy protections for California data subjects and users, including: a) the right to see what data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to know), b) the right to delete the data we have about you, your computer or device (i.e., the right to delete) and c) the right to opt-out of the sale of data about you, your computer or device to certain third parties (i.e., the right to opt-out from sales of your information).\nWe do not discriminate against you if you exercise any of the above rights.\nMoreover, we may not be able to honor a right if doing so would violate applicable law.<br>\n<br> The CCPA defines personal information broadly and as such, it includes pseudonymous identifiers such as cookie IDs and mobile advertising IDs.\nYou may access those rights with respect to AcuityAds by sending us an email to privacy@acuityads.com, by calling our California privacy help line at 1-866-6Acuity, or by visiting our data subject access page here.\nAs a California data subject, if you make a subject access request as set out in this policy, you are entitled to see and delete the personal information that we have about you.\nWe will confirm your request within 10 days and make a good faith attempt to fulfill your request within 45 days.\nEuropean Data Subjects The General Data Privacy Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) affords additional rights to EU data subjects.\nThose rights include the right to complain to EU Supervisory Authorities and the right to access, correct and delete certain personal data processed by AcuityAds.<br>\n<br> As described above, with respect to EU data subjects, personal data includes Pseudonymous Identifiers such as an IP address, a mobile advertising ID or a cookie ID.\nWhere AcuityAds is a controller of data (e.g.\nvia our Platform), the legal basis will be both legitimate interest and consent in accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR and depending on the type of information subject to processing and the information we receive from upstream partners.\nWhere we rely upon legitimate interest, we have assessed the processing is not high risk and will not violate fundamental human rights.\nWe process personal data of clients and partners for the performance of our contracts with them in accordance with Article 6 of the GDPR.<br>\n<br> Where AcuityAds receives from an EU data subject a request to cease processing of data via one of the choice mechanisms listed above, AcuityAds will stop all data processing with respect to the opted out browser or device unless such processing is required by law.<br>\n<br> If you believe AcuityAds is processing one of your Pseudonymous Identifiers and wish to exercise your right to access, delete, port or remove such information, please click here to visit our EU data subject access request page.<br>\n<br> For all requests concerning the security of your data, please contact our data protection officer at privacy@acuityads.com.<br>\n<br> If you have a particularly sensitive request, please contact our data protection officer by postal mail, as communication by e-mail can always be flawed by security
