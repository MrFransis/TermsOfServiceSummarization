your personal goals.\nIn analyzing the usage of the Services, Lifesum will process certain data for so-called profiling.\nProfiling means processing of your and other users\u2019 personal data to analyze or predict aspects of your use of the Services, behavior and, location in reaching your health goal.\nThe data processed will be user habits where we will track actions taken by you such as when you move between screens, press buttons and take actions on the Services.\nThe purposes of the profiling is to monitor how engaged users are in different features of our Services, find out ways to make the Service more effective (fit for purpose) and vary the features or content to better match your individual usage patterns and preferences.</p>\n<p>The profiling of your data can also be used as the basis for marketing towards other new potential customers on other platforms than the LIFESUM Services, such as other social media platforms.\nPlease note that this so called look-a-like-process of recruiting new customers does not mean that you will receive any marketing.\nNor does it mean that any other third parties will gain access to your data for any other purpose than for LIFESUM to reach new customers, i.e.\nthird party providers (for example social media) will only process your data on behalf of LIFESUM as processors, see further under transfer of data below.</p>\n<p>Lifesum\u2019s processing of your personal data for profiling purposes as described above, does not require any consent as a legal ground to be processed.\nIf this should be the case,
