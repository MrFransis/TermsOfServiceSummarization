paying by credit card, if, for the first time in a billing period, Customer\u2019s usage reaches a total of 50 EUR, DeepL reserves the right to charge the credit card provided by Customer immediately.\nThis serves as a guarantee of payment and occurs only once: Subsequent billing occurs at the end of each billing period, unless the base price and usage costs reach a total of EUR 250 (see Section 9.7).</p>\n</li>\n<li> 9.7 <p>For Products with a variable remuneration, the base remuneration and usage-based remuneration is due at the end of each billing period, as long as it does not exceed EUR 250.\nBase and usage-based remuneration is due in steps of EUR 250 which will be charged to Customer\u2019s credit card once the amount is reached.\nAny remaining amount and any amount below EUR 250 are due at the end of each month.\nCustomer will receive a monthly invoice on the overall monthly remuneration paid.</p>\n</li>\n<li> 9.8 <p>DeepL reserves the right to suspend

<p>DeepL reserves the right to restrict or suspend API features for other reasons than those specified in Section 3.2.4.\nIn such case, DeepL shall inform Customer of the proposed changes with two months\u2019 prior notice in writing (e-mail sufficient).\nFurthermore, DeepL shall grant Customer a reasonable period of at least two (2) months to declare whether or not Customer accepts the proposed changes.\nIf Customer does not give any notice within this period, which shall commence running from the receipt of the notification, the proposed changes shall be deemed as agreed.\nDeepL shall inform Customer of to this legal consequence, i.e., the right of objection, the objection period, and the implications of remaining silent.</p>\n</li>\n<li> 10.5 <p>In the

the Products upon prior written notice (e-mail sufficient).\nNotwithstanding further rights under this Agreement, DeepL shall restore access within a reasonable period of time if the breach does not continue, is no longer imminent, or Customer has provided a binding statement that the breach will not be repeated.\nIn the event of an act with fraudulent intent, DeepL is entitled to suspend Customer's access to the Products immediately and indefinitely.\nCustomer is informed in writing (e-mail is sufficient).\nThe suspicion of fraudulent intent is sufficient.\nFraudulent intent lies in particular in the following cases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The e-mail address used for registration does not exist or is obviously not valid;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The address does not exist or is invalid;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer has registered several times in order to use the service free of charge or Customer still has open payments from other contracts;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer uses a fraudulent, lost, stolen or blocked / inadmissible means of payment;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer has contested or demanded the return of a payment without informing DeepL of a valid reason for contesting or demanding the return.\nThe suspension of Customer\u2019s access will be upheld until Customer informs DeepL of a valid reason.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> 10.6 <p>In case Customer violates the restrictions on using the DeepL API key in certain types of products (Section 8.1.6), utilizes Products with unlimited usage in a way in which they were not intended to (e.g.\naccessing the DeepL Pro Translator in an automatic way) or allows more users to utilize Products than licensed, DeepL reserves the right to disable the access and cancel the Agreement with immediate effect.\nIn this case, Customer will be refunded fees already paid proportionally.</p>\n</li>\n<li> 10.7 <p>For products with a maximum monthly usage cap, DeepL will only allow the contracted number of characters (as described in the Service Specification) to be translated within a billing period.\nOnce the monthly usage limit is reached, Customer will no longer be able to use the Products, unless a Product with a higher number of characters has been purchased (if available).</p>\n</li>\n<li> 10.8 <p>Within the free trial period, Customer and DeepL are allowed to terminate the Agreement at any time with immediate effect.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> 11Right to withdraw from the contract <ol>\n<li>\n<p>If the Customer is consumer in terms of Section 13 German Civil Code (\u201c<i>BGB</i>\u201d) the
