ARBITRATION.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.\nTHE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE

PROCEEDING.\nYOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</p>\n<p>Generally.\nArbitration is a method of resolving a Claim without filing a lawsuit.\n\u201cClaim\u201d means any dispute between you, Company, and/or any involved third party relating to your account, Your Use (defined here), your relationship with Company, or these Terms and Conditions.\nThis includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use of the services, your attempted use of the services, and any act or omission by Company or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the services.\nYou, Company, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim.\nCompany agrees to binding arbitration should it have any Claims against you.\nLikewise, you agree to binding arbitration should you have any Claims against Company.\nBy agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to binding arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to binding arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the \u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16, as amended.</p>\n<p>Exceptions to Binding Arbitration.\nAs an exception to binding arbitration, you and Company both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any claim that is within that court\u2019s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis.\nCompany will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is pending only in that court.\nBinding arbitration also does not apply to disputes concerning trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, copyright infringement or misuse, or trademark infringement or dilution.</p>\n<p>Mandatory Pre-Dispute Procedures.\nYou acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim (subject to the exceptions above) against Company, you will first give us an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute.\nThis includes sending a written description of your problem or dispute to us, including, but not limited to, information or representations related to our services and upon which you rely.\nYou may send the written description by Spark Revenue, 9100 Conroy Windermere Rd., Windermere, FL 34786.\nYou agree to negotiate with Company in good faith about your problem or dispute.\nIf for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 60 days after Company\u2019s receipt of your written dispute, you agree to the dispute resolution provisions below.</p>\n<p>Commencement of Arbitration.\nYou and Company agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (including the mandatory pre-dispute procedures outlined above) and that any proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be barred.\nArbitration Location.\nFor your convenience, the arbitration may be conducted in the federal district where you reside.\nIt may be held by telephone or through written submissions if both you and Company agree.</p>\n<p>Sponsoring Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator.\nYou agree that any Claims shall be resolved by submitting the dispute to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator who is a retired judge or an experienced attorney with experience in the subject(s) of the Claim.\nThe arbitrator shall be chosen from JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the arbitration rules of the selected tribunal shall apply, which can be obtained by calling the selected tribunal.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms and Conditions and this arbitration provision.\nThe arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Company.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Fees.\nCompany shall pay for all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for an arbitration initiated by either party.\nThe parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Award.\nThe arbitrator shall follow substantive law and may order any relief if permitted by law.\nThe arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and punitive damages, so long as they are in accordance with applicable law.\nThe arbitrator may award costs or fees to a prevailing party, but only if the law expressly allows it.\nAlthough Company may have a right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses under some laws if it prevails, Company agrees that it will not seek such an award, unless your Claims are determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous.\nNothing herein shall be construed to limit the arbitrator\u2019s ability to award remedies provided by applicable law.\nAny award rendered shall include a written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA.</p>\n<p>Enforceability.\nThis provision survives your relationship with Company, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer.\nIf the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply.\nIf a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>Miscellaneous.\nFailure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims.\nThis provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Company and shall not be modified except in writing by Company.</p>\n<p>Amendments.\nCompany reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time.\nYour continued use of any Company Website, or use or attempted use of a Company service, is affirmation of your consent to such changes.\nShould the changes to this arbitration provision be material, Company will provide you notice and an opportunity to opt-out.</p>\n<p>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF, USE, OR ATTEMPTED USE OF A COMPANY SERVICE ( WHICHEVER COMES FIRST) BY WRITING TO SPARK REVENUE, 9100 CONROY WINDERMERE RD., WINDERMERE, FL 34786.\nUNTIMELY OPT-OUTS WILL NOT BE VALID AND YOU MUST THEN PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS.</p> 14.\nExclusive Venue for Other Controversies <p>You agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Agreement (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the Supreme Court in New York County, New York, or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.</p> 15.\nRemedies for Company <p>In order to avoid irreparable injury to Company, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of this Agreement, we shall be entitled to seek an injunction and/or other equitable relief restraining such breach.\nNothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting Company from pursuing any other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of monetary damages from you.</p> 16.\nModifications to
