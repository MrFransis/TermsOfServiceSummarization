OF ALL OTHER TERMS.\nIF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO SUCH TERMS.\nIF YOU DO NOT UNCONDITIONALLY AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.</strong>\n</p>Terms of use<p>Welcome to Remind.\nRemind is a messaging platform that helps educators, students, parents and other users send quick, simple messages to any device and for students to gain access to coaching to advance their learning.\nPlease continue reading to learn about the rules and restrictions that govern your use of Remind\u2019s website(s) and all other products, services and applications made available by Remind from time to time (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d).\nThis Agreement includes the terms in this document, as well as Remind\u2019s Privacy Policy, Copyright Dispute Policy, and the Apple Application Terms.\n</p>What this is saying<p>Before using Remind, you need to be at least 18 years old and agree to these terms.\nIf you're under 18, a parent or guardian needs to review and agree to these terms for you.\n</p>Will these terms ever change?<p>We constantly try to improve our Services, so we may update this Agreement as we offer new and improved Services.\nWe may modify this Agreement at any time, but we will do our best to bring this to your attention by posting a notice on the Services or notifying you by email or by some other means.\nIf you don't agree with the new terms, you may reject them but unfortunately you will no longer be able to use the Services.\nYour use of the Services in any way following notification by Remind constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions as modified.\nWe may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features, impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services at any time.\nWe'll provide you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you.\n</p>\n<p>You represent and warrant to Remind that: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>you are at least 18 years old (or, if you are not at least 18 years old, you have your parent's permission to use the Services, and your parent has read and agrees to this Agreement on your behalf).\n</li>\n<li>all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful.\n</li>\n<li>you will maintain the accuracy of such information.\n</li>\n<li>if you're agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to this Agreement on the organization or entity's behalf and bind them to this Agreement (in which case, the references to \"you\" and \"your\" in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).\nYou also certify that you are legally permitted to use and access the Services and take full responsibility for the selection, use of, and access to the Services, including ensuring that you have permission to communicate with anyone you choose to interact with through the Services.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.\n</p>What this is saying<p>We work hard to improve the Remind experience for you, so our terms may change from time to time.\nWe will update you when we make significant changes.\nBefore continuing to use Remind, it will be important to review and agree to any changes.\n</p>Privacy<p>We take the privacy of our users very seriously.\nPlease read our Privacy Policy, located at remind.com/privacy-policy.\nResidents of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), or United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) may read about our additional commitments concerning your privacy by reviewing our pledges to the principles embodied in the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield agreements remind.com/privacy-policy#privacy-shield and how Remind complies with the requirements of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation remind.com/privacy-policy#gdpr.\nRemind also complies with the UK Data Protection Act 2018.\nRemind utilizes Standard Contractual Clauses provided by the EU and approved by the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner's Office to effectuate lawful transfers of the personal data of residents of the EU, EEA, or UK to the United States for processing.</p>What this is saying<p>Another important document to look at is our Privacy Policy, which outlines what personal information Remind collects from you and how we use that information to provide our service.\nWe take extra steps to be able to lawfully transfer the Personal Data of EU, EEA, or UK residents to the US and to comply with the EU\u2019s and UK\u2019s privacy regulation and law.</p>Use by children<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\") requires that online service providers notify parents of children in the United States and obtain their consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13.\n<strong> Remind only collects personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that student's school, district and/or teacher has agreed, via the terms described below, to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services and disclose that personal information to Remind.\n</strong> Except as expressly set forth below, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 13.\nRemind's mechanisms and policies for compliance with COPPA meet or exceed the requirements of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation for the protection of the Personal Data of children.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For children under 13 we may collect a child's name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address or telephone number, and the child's parent's email address.\nWe collect these in order to notify the parent that we may contact the child for the purpose of providing the Services for which the child's teacher, Organizer (as described below) or school administrator has signed up to use.\nNote that if the Remind account of a child under 13 is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, that account has not received a message through the Remind Services in that time), Remind's policy is to delete the personally-identifiable information associated with that child's account.\nWhile we delete the account in these situations, some of the child's data may persist in the files of Remind's agents or service providers for some period of time until it is removed from their systems as well.\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 but only in support of the learning environment.\nFor Remind to collect this type of personal information, a student\u2019s school, district or teacher must agree to obtain parental consent for that child to use the Services, or Remind must obtain that consent.\nThe student\u2019s school, district or teacher may disclose that personal information to us for a legitimate educational interest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are responsible for complying with COPPA in cooperation with Remind, meaning you must obtain consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services or work with Remind to ensure Remind has obtained all necessary consents.\nIf you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you are authorized by your school or district to use the Services.\nYou also represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school or district.\nFor more information on COPPA, please click here.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are a school, district, or teacher providing consent on behalf of parents or guardians, you may be required to provide adequate school credentials and a valid school email address to verify your identity.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we learn we have collected personal information from a student under 13 other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn a student under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.\nIf you believe that a student under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at rmd.me/help.\n</p>What this is saying<p>Remind cares about children's privacy, and complies with COPPA, a law created to protect the privacy of minors.\nWe collect limited information for under-13 users and only if we have parental consent.\nIf we don't have consent from a parent or guardian, we delete the information.\nIf you are a teacher or a school providing consent on behalf of parents, you are also responsible for complying with COPPA.\nYou can learn more here.\n</p>Fees and payment.\nResponsibility for usage charges<p>Access to and use of Remind itself is free, but we do offer additional features that require fees.\nRemind reserves the right to charge fees for certain features.\nWe will notify you when we intend to charge for a service or feature.\nYou will always have the choice whether to use those features.\nIf you continue to use any service or feature after you have been notified of any applicable fees, that use constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased fees.</p>\n<p>Through Remind, you may be able to access and use products or services operated by other individuals or companies who are not employed or controlled by Remind (such as, a payment platform to request and/or make payments).\nIf you use any of these products or services, you must review and agree to the additional terms and conditions and privacy policy, as well as pay any applicable fees required to use those products.\nAny information you agree to provide will be governed by that business' privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Note that, by using the Services, you may receive e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile device, which may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan.\nAny and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility.\nYou should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply to your use of the Services.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we have created additional Plans for schools and districts that want additional features.\nYou may learn about the School and District Plans here: remind.com/plans.</p>What this is saying<p>Remind\u2019s basic service is free right now, and we have no plans to charge users for the basic service.\nWe will charge fees to schools or districts that sign contracts to purchase our School or District Plans.\nYou may choose to use and pay for additional products and services that we or our partners offer.\nWe\u2019ll make it clear when fees are added to Remind.\nWe promise :)</p>Additional terms<p>This Agreement applies to all users of our Services, but there are special terms for you depending on what type of user you are and whether you use the service for free, as do the vast majority of our users, or pay for use of Remind.</p>\n<p>If you are, for example, a student, teammate or parent who is invited to be or added as a member of a class or group by an Organizer, you are a <strong>Participant</strong>.\nIf you are a staff member of a school or school district that has purchased a paid School or District Plan, and have been given administrative rights, then you are a Verified Administrator.\nIf you are a teacher, coach or parent who creates a \u201cclass\u201d or \u201cgroup\u201d of members, then you are an <strong>Organizer</strong>.\nIf you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of an organization, such as a school or school district, club, or team, you are an <strong>Organization</strong>.\nIf you are purchasing an individual account, you are a <strong>Premium Organizer</strong>.\nIf you are retained by Remind to work with students to advance their education, you are a <strong>Coach</strong>.\nYou may not sign up for or use the Services as someone you are not.\nRemind may disable or terminate your account if you do so.\nPlease read on below to find out what

already a member of that class or group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Organizer and other Participants of your class or group may be able to view information (including your personally identifiable information but not personal contact information), as well as your User Submissions (defined below).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are connected to an Organization that has purchased a Plan from Remind, Verified Administrators of the Organization will be able to see and edit your contact information.\nVerified Administrators may be able to add, remove, and/or move you from classes or groups within the same Organization.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are accessing the Services as an <strong>Organizer</strong> (such as a teacher, administrator, parent or other adult creating a class or group) and

Participants and other Organizers to your class or group by distributing \"class codes\" or \"group codes\", and communicate with those users, (in some cases, there may be more than one Organizer per class/group).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may only share class or group codes with Participants and Organizers whom you wish to subscribe to your class/group.\nIf you plan to broadly or publicly publish these codes, you must manage the accuracy of your subscriber lists carefully.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It's your responsibility to maintain and monitor the accuracy of list of Participants for each of your classes or groups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are connected to an Organization on a Remind Plan you may receive additional privileges from a Verified Administrator of your Organization.\nThese privileges may include access to information and User Submissions (defined below) (including personally identifiable information but not personal contact information) of Participants and other Organizers in your class, group or affiliated Organization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are connected to an Organization on a Remind Plan, Verified Administrators of that Organization may be able to join or message members of your class or group, add or update information in your Remind account profile, add, move or remove you from classes or groups affiliated with the Organization, and/or take other actions relating to your access and use of the Services through the Organization.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are an <strong>Organization</strong> (such as a school, school district or club):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information relating to your Organization.\nIf at any time you learn that a user of the Services claims to be affiliated with your organization but is not, in fact, affiliated with your Organization, or of any other inaccuracy relating to your Organization\u2019s information, you will remove that user from your Organization and, if appropriate, notify Remind immediately by visiting rmd.me/help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you purchase an Individual Plan, you are a <strong>Premium Organizer</strong>, which gives you access to premium features, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delivering SMS messages to carriers that are blocked for free users, and</li>\n<li>Delivering messages with extended length.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If

directly with other users affiliated with your Organization,</li>\n<li>access and manage information and User Submissions, and</li>\n<li>\n<p>view the contact information, which will include personally identifiable information, of all Remind users connected with your school or district, as appropriate, and see which of those users received communications from your school or district.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO ANY OF THE ABOVE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE ALL RIGHTS AND HAVE OBTAINED ALL CONSENTS AND AUTHORIZATIONS NECESSARY TO PERFORM SUCH TASKS AND THAT YOU WILL ONLY USE PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE PRIVACY LAWS.\nRemind may use the information you upload to the Services in order to verify Organizers\u2019 and Participants\u2019 affiliations and otherwise to help us provide you with the Services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With respect to all users of Remind, whether you are a Participant, Organizer or Organization, Premium Organizer, Verified Administrator, or Coach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>IF YOU INVITE OR ADD ANYONE TO USE REMIND AND/OR USE ANY FEATURE OF THE SERVICES WHICH REQUIRES SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION OF ANYONE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IF YOU IMPORT CONTACTS FROM YOUR ADDRESS BOOK TO THE SERVICES), YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE OBTAINED FREELY GIVEN, INFORMED CONSENT FROM EACH PERSON TO:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>RECEIVE SUCH INVITATION AND BE ADDED TO THE SERVICES;</li>\n<li>RECEIVE MESSAGES FROM REMIND, OTHER PARTICIPANTS OF THE CLASS OR GROUP, AND OTHERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR CLASS OR GROUP (SUCH AS, ORGANIZERS AND VERIFIED ADMINISTRATORS).\nAND</li>\n<li>PROVIDE THAT PERSON'S PERSONAL INFORMATION TO REMIND.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>What this is saying<p>You have different rights and responsibilities depending on what type of user you are: Organizer, Participant, Organization, Premium Organizer, Verified Administrator, or Coach.\nIn all cases, you need consent from every person you wish to add, invite, or send messages to via Remind.</p>Registration and security<p>As a condition to using Services, you may be required to register with Remind by selecting a password and providing your name and a valid email address.\nYou will provide Remind with accurate, complete, and updated registration information.\nYou may not: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>select or use the name or email of another person with the intent to impersonate that person.\nor </li>\n<li>use a name subject to any rights of any person other than you without appropriate authorization.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remind reserves the right to refuse registration of or to cancel a Remind account in its sole discretion.\nYou will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password.\nYou may not transfer your account to anyone without express prior written consent of Remind.\nViolation of any of the foregoing may result in immediate termination of your account, revocation of your ability to use the Services, and may subject you to state and federal penalties and other legal consequences.\nRemind reserves the right, but will have no obligation, to investigate your use of the Services in order to determine whether a violation of the Agreement has occurred or to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.\n</p>What this is saying<p>The security of your account is very important to us.\nPlease keep your password safe, use your real name and create your own account before using Remind.\n</p>Consent to receive periodic messages<p>As part of the Services, you will receive communications through the Services, including messages that Remind sends you (for example, via SMS, emails, and push notifications).\nWhen an Organizer adds a new Participant to a class or group, that Participant will receive a welcome message, instructions on how to stop receiving messages, and information on how to avoid certain charges by downloading the Remind application.\nRemind may inform Participants who have not replied that they will automatically be removed from the class or group.\nRemind may also send other administrative messages.\nBY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM REMIND AS WELL AS CLASS OR GROUP ORGANIZERS AND PARTICIPANTS, AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH PERSON YOU INVITE AND/OR ADD HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM YOU AND REMIND.\nIf you connect to or use any third party services in conjunction with Remind, you acknowledge and consent to receive notifications and messages from those third party services.\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Remind harmless for and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or in any way related to your breach of the foregoing.\nTo permanently cease receiving SMS text messages, please text @STOPALL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in reply to any SMS message from that class or group,</li>\n<li>to a Remind long-code (a phone number issued by Remind), or</li>\n<li>in the US, to the Remind short code 81010.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information see this link.</p>\n<p>If you are located in Canada, you may opt out of receiving marketing messages (including text messages and emails).\nhowever, you may still receive text message and email communications that are necessary for the Services or otherwise exempt from anti-spam laws.\n</p>What this is saying<p>We're letting you know that you may periodically receive messages from us in addition to other Remind users.\nIt's important that you get prior consent from everyone you invite or add to Remind.\nWe've provided instructions on how to easily unsubscribe and stop receiving messages.\n</p>Consent to receive emergency messages<p>As part of the Services you may receive communications through the Services in the event of an emergency, through SMS (text messages), emails, push notifications, or phone call.\nAn emergency meriting a message shall be determined solely by your teacher, organizer, school or district or any official designated by a school or district, or a government agency.\nBY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS FROM REMIND WHENEVER IT IS DETERMINED THAT CIRCUMSTANCES MERIT THOSE COMMUNICATIONS.\nIF YOU ARE A TEACHER, ORGANIZER, VERIFIED ADMINISTRATOR, SCHOOL OR DISTRICT OFFICIAL YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT EACH PERSON YOU INVITE AND/OR ADD HAS CONSENTED TO RECEIVE COMMUNICATIONS FROM YOU AND REMIND.\nIf you connect to or use any third party services in conjunction with Remind, you acknowledge and consent to receive notifications and messages from those third party services.\nBecause Remind does not control whether to send or not send an emergency notification, Remind is never responsible for your receipt of, or failure to receive an emergency message.\nOften when an emergency is suspected the individuals empowered to determine whether to send an emergency message through Remind may have incorrect or only partial information.\nRemind is not responsible for messages sent erroneously or for the content of any message sent as an emergency message, even when the content of that message contains information that is incomplete, confusing, or erroneous.\nYOU ALONE CAN DETERMINE WHAT, IF ANY, ACTIONS TO TAKE IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY OR IN RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY MESSAGE YOU RECEIVE THROUGH REMIND.\nYOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD REMIND HARMLESS FOR AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LIABILITIES, DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL), LOSSES AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES) ARISING FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO YOUR RECEIPT OF EMERGENCY MESSAGES OR YOUR FAILURE TO RECEIVE AN EMERGENCY MESSAGE.</p>\n<p>While we strongly encourage you not to, you may opt out of receiving emergency messages as SMS text messages or emails, but not phone calls.\nTo permanently cease receiving SMS text messages, please text @STOPALL:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in reply to any SMS message from that class or group,</li>\n<li>to a Remind long-code (a phone number issued by Remind), or</li>\n<li>in the US, to the Remind short code 81010.\nFor more information see this link.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the authorized administrator at your school or district is sharing information from the School Information System with Remind, you will receive emergency messages as phone calls to the phone number you have on record with your school or district.\nYou will receive these phone calls even if you opt out of receiving SMS text messages on Remind.\nYou can opt out of receiving these phone calls only by having the authorized administrator at your school or district remove your contact information from their School Information System.\n</p>What this is saying<p>We are letting you know that in the event of an emergency, determined by those individuals in your school, school district, community or a government official and not Remind, you may receive emergency messages from us in addition to other Remind users.\nWhile Remind provides schools and districts with the ability to send emergency messages through Remind, Remind is neither responsible for your receipt of or failure to receive a message, nor your actions, failure to act or the actions or inactions of others in response to any emergency message.\nWe do not want you to opt out of these messages as your schools or district may wish for you to receive an emergency message.\nHowever, we provided instructions on how to easily unsubscribe and stop receiving SMS text messages and emails.\nTo stop receiving phone calls, you need to talk to your school or district.</p>Content<p>You agree that you may only use the Services in accordance with Remind's Community Guidelines.\n</p>\n<p>All materials displayed or performed or

law.\nYou agree you will abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Services, and will not use, copy, modify, publish, distribute, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purposes whatsoever any Content, third party submissions or other proprietary rights not owned by you: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>without

without Remind's prior written consent, except in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>In the course of using the Services, you may provide information which may be used by Remind in connection with the Services and which may be visible to certain other users.\nAnything you post, upload, share, store or otherwise provide through the Services are, together with any related

your User Submissions for any purpose related to providing and/or improving the Services (however, Remind will only share your personally identifiable information in accordance with Remind's current

Services, the recipients of your message will be able to save, copy, edit and store that message).\nAll information publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated and that Remind will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any Content.\nRemind cannot guarantee the identity of any other users

personally identifiable information, Remind will notify affected users or post a notice on the Services as required by applicable law(s).\n</p>What this is saying<p>Be sure to only share content that belongs to you.\nWe may view and/or use content you post on Remind (for example, format a message you send and display it to the recipients)\u2014but you still own it.\n</p>\n<p>Also, be sure to read our Community Guidelines, which include best practices for how to keep the Remind community safe.\nWe need to work together to ensure Remind is a secure and supportive environment.\n</p>Your

Switzerland or the UK who uses Remind?<p>\n</p>\n<p>Remind complies with the EU GDPR and the UK Information Protection Act 2018 and makes it easy for EU, EEA, Swiss or UK residents to exercise their rights described in that regulation.\nThe purposes for which Remind collects your Personal Data, the categories and specific types of Personal Data we collect, and our practices and policies regarding your Personal Data are described in this Privacy Policy.\nAs discussed throughout this Privacy Policy, Remind makes it easy for you to access, correct, delete, or demand deletion of your Personal Data.\nYou may object to our processing of your Personal data by emailing us, although if you prohibit our processing, it may make some of our Services either impossible to offer or less useful.\nAny of those requests should be sent to privacy@remindhq.com.\nShould you ever wish to leave Remind and take an electronic copy of the Personal Data and information we have collected about you, you may make that request at privacy@remindhq.com.\nIn addition to contacting our Data Protection Officer or the Better Business Bureau, EU individuals may contact the Data Protection Authority of Ireland by

European Union, European Economic Area, Swiss, or United Kingdom Individual?<p>\n</p>\n<p>Remind complies with all applicable privacy laws and regulations that apply to individuals of the EU, EEA, Switzerland, or the UK.\nRemind may lawfully transfer EU, EEA, UK or Swiss individuals' Personal Data, as that term is defined in the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\").\nRemind complies with the principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information transferred from European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.\nRemind has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles and also applies those to the transfers of personal data of individuals from the EEA and UK to the US for processing.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view Remind's certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.\n</p>\n<p>In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles and by extending these Principles to transfers of the personal data of residents of the EEA and UK to the US, Remind commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Information.\nPursuant to the Privacy Shield, Remind remains liable for the transfer of personal data to third parties acting as our agents unless we can prove we were not a party to the events giving rise to the damages.\nEuropean Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Remind at: privacy@remindhq.com.\nRemind is subject to the jurisdiction of the US Federal Trade Commission for any alleged failure of Remind to meet our privacy commitments.\nYou may contact Remind's Data Privacy Officer at any time at privacy@remindhq.com.\n</p>\n<p>Remind has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus, located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit https://bbbprograms.org/programs/all-programs/bbb-privacy-shield/file-a-complaint for more information and to file a complaint.\nThe services of the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD are provided at no cost to you.</p>\n<p>If your Privacy Shield complaint remains unresolved by the above methods, there is a possibility, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms.\nSee Annex I for additional information.</p>What this is saying<p>Remind is legally authorized to send the Personal Data of EU, EEA, UK or Swiss individuals to the US for processing because we have made legally-binding commitments that are enforceable by US government agencies responsible for consumer protection.\nRemind provides you, as an EU, EEA, UK or Swiss individual, both a means of directly contacting Remind to exercise your privacy rights and with a third party dispute resolution service.</p>What does this privacy policy cover?<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Remind collects, uses and discloses information from you and other users who access or use the Services, including our treatment of Personal Information.\nAlso, this Privacy Policy covers Remind's treatment of any Personal Information that our partners share with us, or that you provide to Remind through another third party website or service while using the Services.\nThis policy does not apply to websites, services or practices of companies that we do not own or control, even if they help us operate our Services.\nThird party providers who do help us operate our Services must adhere to privacy and security obligations in a manner consistent with Remind's policies and practices.</p>What this is saying<p>Here's what this policy covers: all information that you provide to us and that we collect while you're using Remind.\nThis policy doesn't cover third party companies that we don't control but who help us operate our service.\nThose third party companies must adhere to privacy and security obligations in a manner consistent with Remind's policies and practices.\nKeep reading, there's more about this later! </p>How is children's Personal Information treated?<p>We have included some information below related to the Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act (\"COPPA\").\nCOPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent and provide notice before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 (\"under-13 users\").\nRemind typically relies on a teacher, school, or school district to obtain verifiable parental consent to provide our services to under-13 users.\nPursuant to COPPA, we may collect an under-13 user's name (first name and last initial), date of birth, email address and/or telephone number in order to operate and provide the Services, and we may collect the under-13 user's parent's (or legal guardian's) email address in order to provide notice to the child's parent or guardian that we may contact the under-13 user for the purpose of allowing access to and use of the Services.\nIf Remind does not receive the parent's email address within a reasonable time period, the under-13 user will not be able to receive any messages and his/her Personal Information will be deleted.\nIf an under-13 user's Remind account is inactive for at least twelve months (meaning, the account has not received a message through the Services in that period of time), Remind's policy is to delete the Personal Information.\nIf we learn we have collected Personal Information from an under-13 user other than pursuant to the above, or if we learn that an under-13 user has provided us Personal Information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible after we have identified it.\nIf you believe that an under-13 user may have provided us Personal Information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at report@remindhq.com.\n</p>\n<p>In order for an under-13 user to gain access to additional features or services, Remind may employ one or more methods approved by the Federal Trade Commission for verifying parental consent.</p>\n<p>While COPPA requires Remind to follow these procedures for under-13 users in the United States, Remind employs the same process to obtain consent for all users under 13 years old.</p>What this is saying<p>Remind collects limited information from children under-13, and we rely on a teacher, school, or district to get permission from each child's parent when collecting this information.\nIf we don't have a parent's email address associated with their child's account, or if the child's account is inactive after some time, we delete the account.\nContact us at rmd.me/help with any questions.\n</p>What information does Remind display or collect?<p>When you use the Services, you may set up your personal profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels as permitted by the functionality of the Services.\nRemind will not display your personal contact information to other users, without your permission.\nIf, however, you utilize Remind in an organization that has paid for a School or District Plan we will share your personal contact information solely with Verified Administrators chosen by your school or district and verified by Remind.\nIf you participate in an educational coaching session with a Coach employed by Remind, we will share sufficient information with the Coach to facilitate your coaching session.\nThe information we gather from users enables us to attempt to verify user identity, allows our users to set up a user account and profile through the Services, and helps us personalize and improve our Services.\nWe retain this information to provide the Services to you and our other users and to provide a useful user experience.\nWhen you update your information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time in case you need to need to go back to that version.</p>What this is saying<p>The information you provide to us by creating an account (or when joining a class or group or purchasing a coaching session) is used to deliver our service to you.\nFor example, we use this information to attempt to verify your identity and help you create an account on Remind.\nWe will not share personal contact information, besides your full name, to other users on Remind without your permission.\nIf you use Remind through your school or district, we will share your contact information with Verified Administrators.</p>Information you provide to us<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly enter on the Services, whether via computer, mobile phone, other wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way.\nWith your express consent, you may be able to upload, import or sync contact information from your mobile device (for example, from your address book) to Remind.\nThis information may include Personal Information such as your name, phone numbers, email addresses, photographs, and, in certain circumstances, your school and/or district, class, group, grades and report card, video that may contain your voice and image, club, team or Organization affiliation (which may be used to validate your account or to provide you with notifications via the Services from a teacher, school and/or district, class, group, club, team or affiliated Organization (\"Notifications\"), or any other information necessary for us to provide our Services.\nFor under-13 users, we collect a name (first name and last initial), date of birth, district, school, class, grades and report card, video that may contain that child\u2019s voice and image, email address and/or telephone number, and that under-13 user's parent's email address to provide notice to the parent regarding the Services.\nYou may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.\nWe use the Personal Information we receive about you to provide you with the Services and also for purposes such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>attempting to authenticate your identity, </li>\n<li>responding to your requests for certain information, </li>\n<li>customizing the features that we make available to you, </li>\n<li>suggesting relevant services or products for you to use, </li>\n<li>improving the Services and internal operations (including troubleshooting, testing, and analyzing usage), </li>\n<li>communicating with you about new features </li>\n<li>and, most importantly, protecting our users, sending emergency messages we are directed to send to you, and working towards making sure our Services are safer and more secure.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may modify or remove your Personal Information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your classes, groups, and/or account information.\nIf an Organizer or a Verified Administrator uploads or adds information about you to your account, you may have to contact and work directly with that Organizer or Verified Administrator in order to modify or remove that information.\n</p>What this is saying<p>The information you provide to Remind is also used to analyze usage and improve our products and services.\nWe don't show or share your Personal Information without your permission except in the few circumstances described here.\nWe may also review account information to protect the safety of our community.\n</p>Information collected automatically<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you use the Services.\nRemind automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including Remind cookie information, the page you requested, and other usage information such as your activity on the Services, the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show).\nNone of this information constitutes Personal Information.\nCertain information that is collected automatically, such as device ID, IP address and phone number, and browsing information that is associated with a user will be treated as Personal Information.\nIn addition, for users who are students, teachers or administrators of schools or districts that contract with Remind for paid Plans, Remind may, with the consent of the Verified Administrator in the school or district, obtain information from a third party Student Information System (SIS) provider, which will include basic directory and class roster information, attendance information, class grades and report cards, and similar information that is Personal Information.</p>\n<p>We also may provide to our partners aggregate information derived from automatically collected information about how our users, collectively, use our site.\nWe may share this type of non-personally identifiable, aggregated statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services as well as Remind.\n</p>What this is saying<p>There is certain information that we gather automatically when you use Remind, such as navigation and cookie information.\nSome of this information is collected and used in an aggregate and anonymized way to help improve our service.\nIf Personal Information is included, we treat it carefully like all other Personal Information.\n</p>Mobile application<p>When users use our mobile application, we automatically collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address, device ID, device type, and what operating system (OS) the user is running.\n</p>\n<p>We collect users' IP addresses whenever they use our mobile application, which provides us with a coarse approximation of the user's location at the city level in order for Remind to, for example: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide Organizers with a geo-specific long-code (i.e., generic phone number with a local area code), </li>\n<li>support features such as school selection, and </li>\n<li>enable other internal measurement and Services features.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also may, with your express consent, request more specific location information in order to provide you with more relevant information (such as nearby classes or relevant groups that you may subscribe to).\nWe will not store or track your device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission.\nWe may also collect location-based information from users as part of providing the Services and in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations for the user's jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>While Remind collects and temporarily stores phone numbers of first-time users under 13 years of age, we will delete the information collected if parental consent is not obtained.\nIf the underage user has signed up for the Services through SMS and then downloaded Remind's mobile application, Remind will have and may use the underage user's phone number: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>to merge the under-13 user's accounts, </li>\n<li>to continue SMS delivery services, and/or </li>\n<li>as a back-up method of notification.\n</li>\n</ul>What this is saying<p>When you use the Remind app, there may be additional information that we collect like your device ID, phone number and approximate location.\n</p>Email and text message communications<p>If you provide us your email address or phone number, Remind may send you administrative messages (such as updates, notifications, newsletters, and other news) relating to the Services or to respond to communications from you.\nRemind may also send you emergency messages when we are directed to do so by a teacher, school, district or government agency.\nBy maintaining a Remind account and/or not opting out of receiving information from Remind, you acknowledge and agree that you may receive e-mail or SMS text messages on your phone or mobile device from other Remind users, from Remind and/or its agents (as described below) and other individuals or companies if you choose to use services or products that they offer.\nReceiving these messages may cause you to incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with your wireless or data service plan.\nAny and all such charges, fees, or costs are your sole responsibility.\nYou should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees, or costs may apply.\nWe may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us if your computer supports this type of program.\nCommunications of this type are also sent to under-13 users and the parental consent to use this service also covers these messages.\nIf you no longer wish to receive administrative email messages from Remind you may opt-out by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each message or by contacting us at rmd.me/help.\nPlease note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing the legal notices for changes.\n</p>\n<p>To permanently cease receiving SMS text messages, please text @STOPALL: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>in reply to any SMS message from that class or group, </li>\n<li>to a Remind long-code (a phone number issued by Remind), or </li>\n<li>in the US, to the Remind short code 81010.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information see this link.</p>\n<p>If you are located in Canada, you may opt out of receiving marketing messages (including text messages and emails).\nhowever, you may still receive text message and email communications that are necessary for the Services or otherwise exempt from anti-spam laws.</p>What this is saying<p>We may send you administrative messages regarding Remind.\nWe may also send you emergency messages when directed to do so by appropriate school, school district or government officials.\nYou can learn how to unsubscribe from receiving all messages by clicking here.\n</p>Push notifications<p>We send notices to you when an Organizer of your class or group has posted something new to your class or group, you are sent a message, or when Remind needs to inform you of something.\nIf you no longer wish to receive such communications, you may turn them off at the device level.\nIf you are a parent of an under-13 user, you always have the choice to no longer allow your child to receive such communications by contacting us at rmd.me/help.\nAny user may contact us at rmd.me/help if such user no longer wishes to receive communications from the Services.\n</p>What this is saying<p>There are different notification options.\nWe may send push notifications to your class.\nyou can always opt out of these.\n</p>What about cookies, pixels, and local storage?<p>Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web.\nLike many websites, Remind uses cookies to discover how people are using our Services and to make them work better.\n</p>\n<p>A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email notification.\nAs many services do, we (or our agents) may use pixels to learn whether you've interacted with certain web or email content on our Services.\nThis helps us measure and improve our Services and personalize your experience on Remind.\n</p>\n<p>Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device.\nWe use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with Remind.\n</p>\n<p>Remind uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our Services in various ways.\nThese uses generally fall into one of the following categories: </p>Authentication and security<ul>\n<li>To log you into Remind.\n</li>\n<li>To protect your security.\n</li>\n<li>To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Remind's policies.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to Remind and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account.\n</p>Preferences<p>To remember information about your browser and your preferences.\n</p>\n<p>For example, cookies may help us remember your preferred language or country that you are in.\nWe can then provide you with Remind content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit Remind.\nWe can also customize content based on your country, such as disabling SMS, or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws.\n</p>Analytics and research<p>To help us improve and understand how people use our Services.\n</p>\n<p>For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see which particular features or content users prefer or to share information about our services to you as you interact online across the internet.\nWe might also optimize and improve your experience on Remind by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on.\nWe may use Google Analytics to assist us with this.</p>\n<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.\nWe strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be able to log in or use many of the Services' features without cookies enabled.\nNote that the use of cookies by anyone other than Remind is not covered by our privacy policy.\nWe do not have access or control over those cookies.\n</p>What this is saying<p>Cookies are bits of information that tell us you've visited Remind before and help the browser remember things about you (such as your language setting).\nOur cookies do not collect any Personal Information from you.\nThis only applies to Remind cookies and no one else's.\n</p>Promoting Remind on Other Sites<p>Remind partners with third-parties to promote our Services.\nIf you respond to one of our posts and visit or register to use our Services, we may provide these third-party companies with identifiers from your device or computer, such as an IP address or device ID, to help us analyze our user acquisition efforts.\nNo student personal data is shared with third-party promotion services.</p>What this is saying<p>Cookies are bits of information that tell us you've visited Remind before and help the browser remember things about your device (such as your language setting).\nCookies also help us manage our promotional material on other sites.\nOur cookies do not collect any Personal Information from you.\nThis only applies to Remind cookies and no one else's.</p>Mobile analytics<p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality and improve the performance of our mobile software on your phone.\nThis software may collect, store and use information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.\nThis software may share information it collects with other third parties (1) as part of providing the analytics services.\n(2) with integrations that advance teaching, school or district services, student learning or achievement, or parent or guardian participation in their child's education or activities.\nand, (3) to comply with applicable laws.\n</p>What this is saying<p>When you use the Remind app on your phone or tablet, we have analytics that help us understand how you use the app.\nThis helps us improve the features &amp.\ndesign! </p>What happens when I associate my account with a school or other organization?<p>Users may have the choice of associating their account with a school or other Organization (such as a team or group).\nThis may be required (for example) for teachers and may be either required or strongly encouraged for other types of Organizers in order to use certain features of the Services.\nOther users may attend a school or school district that contracts with Remind for use of Remind's Plans and this may automatically create an account for all the students, teachers, parents and relevant administrators of that class, school, or district and associate their accounts with the class, school, or district.\n</p>\n<p>By associating your account with an Organization, you acknowledge and agree that a Verified Administrator may be able to view your User Submissions (including your Personal Information and messaging content).\nIn addition, Verified Administrators may be able to make administrative changes to your account, such as removing you from classes and/or groups, sending messages on your behalf, and more.\nIn addition, depending upon the preferences of the Verified Administrator and the Organization, Remind may be used as a school directory and information such as your name, classes or groups may be made available to people in your Organization.</p>\n<p>If you are an Organizer affiliated with an Organization, you acknowledge that Remind may enable other users who are associated with the same Organization to contact you -- for example, teachers, students, or parents who are associated with your Organization may communicate with you.\nParticipants may also contact each other (in addition to viewing User Submissions).\nRemind does not display in a user's account profile personal contact information of the user to any other users without prior consent.\n</p>What this is saying<p>You may be required to link your account with an Organization.\nLinking helps to verify your identity and may unlock certain features.\nIf your Organization is managed by a Verified Administrator, they may also have access to certain information in your Remind account, including your personal contact information.\nWe will not display your personal contact information to other users without your permission.\n</p>Will Remind share any of the Personal Information it receives?<p>Remind relies on its users to provide accurate Personal Information in order to provide our Services.\nWe try our best to protect that information and make sure that we are responsible in handling, disclosing, and retaining your data.\nWe neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone.\nIf other Remind users, other individuals or companies whose products you choose to use, have access to your Personal Information (for example, your messaging content), they may use and share that information in ways that Remind cannot, and does not, control.\nRemind shares your Personal Information in personally identifiable form as described below.\n</p>Agents and third party service providers<p>Advertising is not permitted on the Services.\nHowever, we employ other companies to perform tasks on our behalf and help us provide certain features of our Services, and may need to share your information with those companies in order to provide our Services to you.\nSome examples of services for which we use agents include sending email or SMS, analyzing data, providing user services, and searching for any security vulnerabilities.\nThese agents may use Personal Information we share with them, for example, to assist us, to provide their services to you and/or us, and to measure and improve the performance of their services.\nPlease see here for further information about the agents we use as part of the Services (including any of their specific terms or policies that are applicable and that may govern use of your information).\nRemind has reviewed the privacy policies and practices of these agents and third party service providers in order to verify that they are capable of complying with Remind's policies and practices, including those related to the collection, use, transfer, confidentiality, security and integrity of user data.\nAs a condition of contracting with Remind, those agents and third-party service providers committed, in writing, to providing at least equivalent privacy and security for your data as does Remind.\n</p>\n<p>Additional Information for EU, EEA or UK Individuals Regarding Transfers to Third Parties Governed by GDPR</p>\n<p>If you are from the EU, EEA or UK and one of our agents or third-party service providers fails to uphold these standards with respect to your Personal Information that we transferred to that agent or provider on your behalf, that agent or third-party service provider may be liable for any injury as required by GDPR.</p>\n<p>Additional Information for EU, EEA, UK and Swiss Individuals Regarding Transfers to Third Parties Governed by Privacy Shield</p>\n<p>In cases of onward transfer of data of EU, EEA, UK or Swiss individuals to third-party agents or service providers in the US received through the use of Standard Contractual Clauses and consistent with the principles of the EU-US or Swiss-US Privacy Shield, Remind is potentially liable.\nRemind will work with you to resolve any such failure and, if the provider is no longer able to resolve the matter, Remind will resolve the matter and may bear responsibility if there is any liability.\nWe will review those agents' policies and practices at least annually, but you should review them as well.\nYou hereby consent to our sharing of information about you (including, in some cases, Personal Information) for such purposes.</p>What this is saying<p>Remind does not rent or sell your Personal Information.\nWe may share your information to provide certain features of the Remind service, only as permitted by this policy.\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to us at rmd.me/help.\n</p>Business transfers<p>If Remind (or substantially all of its assets) is acquired by another company, user information may be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that company.\nYou acknowledge that such a transfer may occur, and that any acquirer of Remind may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.\nYou will be notified via email or some other means of any change in ownership or uses of your Personal Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personal Information (including the right to delete your information).\nIf Remind goes out of business without a successor, Remind would delete your information.\n</p>What this is saying<p>If Remind is bought by another company, we may need to provide your information to that company.\nWe will be sure to let you know if this ever happens so you can make decisions about your Personal Information.\n</p>Protection of Remind and others<p>We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>comply with the law or national security request (for example, responding to a subpoena or other legal process).\n</li>\n<li>enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements.\nor </li>\n<li>protect the rights, property, or safety of Remind, our employees, our users, or others.\nThis includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also may be required to disclose an individual's Personal Information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n</p>What this is saying<p>We may release your Personal Information if necessary to protect our community (for example, to comply with legal requests).\n</p>With your consent<p>You will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with agents or companies other than Remind and you will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this information unless Remind determines that not disclosing this to you prior to your information being shared is necessary to comply with applicable laws or legal processes or we are prohibited by law or legal processes from informing you in advance.\n</p>What this is saying<p>If there is any other reason we need to share your Personal Information (other than for legal reasons), we will get your consent first.\n</p>Is information about me secure?<p>The security of Personal Information in the school environment is a top priority for Remind.\n</p>\n<p>Remind has protections in place to enhance our users' security, and routinely update these protections.\nWe have administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure of or access to Personal Information.\nIn particular: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our engineering team is dedicated to keeping your Personal Information secure.\n</li>\n<li>We work with industry-leading auditors to review and guide our security policies and procedures.\n</li>\n<li>Remind stores its data within an AWS region that is FedRAMP compliant.\n</li>\n<li>Remind's main database and all backups are encrypted at rest.\n</li>\n<li>The AWS cloud infrastructure has been designed and managed in compliance with regulations, standards, and best-practices, including HIPAA, SOC 1/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 (formerly SAS70), SOC 2, SOC 3, PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, DIACAP and FISMA, ITAR, FIPS 140-2, CSA, and MPAA.\n</li>\n<li>Low-level auditing software is run on all production systems to record potentially malicious actions that may take place.\n</li>\n<li>Increased focus for all software companies on advancing cybersecurity has led Remind to undertake industry standard software security measures.\nFor example, Remind runs periodic penetration tests and a bug bounty program with trusted, vetted and verified security researchers then logs and resolves discovered issues.\n</li>\n<li>All Remind clients use TLS/SSL when communicating with our servers.\n</li>\n<li>We utilize a bug bounty program under the guidance of HackerOne and its vetted, software security experts to help us identify and quickly resolve any previously unknown software bugs.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Remind endeavors to protect user information and to ensure that user account information is kept private.\nhowever, we cannot guarantee the security of user account information.\nUnauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.\nIf Remind knows or becomes aware of a security breach of its users' personally identifiable information, Remind will notify affected users as required by applicable laws and may post a notice on the Services as required by applicable law(s).\nFor additional information about the security measures we use in connection with the Services, please contact us at security@remindhq.com.\n</p>\n<p>The Services contain links to other sites or services.\nRemind is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites.\nWhen linking to another site you should read the privacy policy stated on that site.\nThis Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.\n</p>What this is saying<p>The security of your Personal Information is extremely important to us and we take measures internally to make sure your information is safe with us.\nWe routinely update our security features and implement new protections for your data.\nIf we learn that your data was breached, we will notify you as soon as possible so you can take actions to protect your data.\nLearn more about how Remind approaches security here.\n</p>Third party services<p>You may be able to access certain third party products through Remind's Services to share content to or from another website or app.\nThese are not Remind products.\nthey are another company's and we do not control their privacy and security practices so only you can decide whether to connect your Remind account with another company's services.\n</p>\n<p>Payment processing services on Remind are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the \"Stripe Services Agreement\").\nBy agreeing to the Agreement, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, which Stripe may modify from time to time.\nAs a condition of Remind enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Remind with accurate and complete information about you and your entity (if applicable), and you authorize Remind to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.\n</p>\n<p>The third party products you choose to use on Remind may need to collect and use your Personal Information in order to provide their services to you.\nin order to use any products or services offered by anyone other than Remind, you must review and agree to their specific terms and privacy policies.\n</p>\n<p>Our Services may also include access to, among others: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workplace productivity apps that allow for the sharing of content or video or screen sharing, such as but not limited to, Google Docs, Microsoft Office, Dropbox, or Quip.\nor</li>\n<li>Social media features, such as the Facebook \"Like\" button, and widgets, such as the \"Share this\" button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are either hosted by another company or hosted directly on our Services.\nWhen connecting your Remind account with any third party site you may benefit from the ability to communicate across sites.\nAlthough a class owner may share their roster with a third party service to send content to the students and parents in a class, the class owner may not share phone numbers, email addresses or similar information without the express consent of the user themselves or the Verified Administrator.\nFurthermore under 13 year old students will never have their external contact points shared.\nUnder 13 users will only be able to receive, but not send, content and communications originating from either one of these third party services or a user of those services.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>What this is saying<p>You may choose to use products offered by another individual or company while using Remind.\nSince these products are offered by companies other than Remind (and are not covered by our Privacy Policy), you will need to review and agree to their terms before using their products.\nRemind will not allow Remind users younger than 13 to send communications using products offered by another individual or company while using Remind.\n</p>\n<p>Remind acknowledges that individuals from the EU, EEA, UK and various states in the United States have the right to access the Personal Information that we maintain about them.\nAny individual who seeks access to, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, or to port their data to another, similar service should direct their query to contact@remindhq.com or privacy@remindhq.com.\nIf requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>\n<p>28 contact@remindhq.com</p>What information can I access and modify?<p>As a Remind account holder, you have access to view and update the following information at your discretion: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>information in your user account (such as your email address), </li>\n<li>Participant names, </li>\n<li>user preferences, and </li>\n<li>content in your account (note that once provided, you may not be able to edit or remove certain types of content, such as messages) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This list may change as the Services change.</p>\n<p>You also have the right to request access to the Personal Information we hold about you in order to verify the Personal Information we have collected in respect of you and to have a

purposes such as diagnosing problems with the service and for auditing legal investigations, but reserves the right to delete this information in accordance with its standard business practices in effect from time to time.\nFurther, information and other content you have provided may remain visible elsewhere to the extent such content was copied or stored by other users.\n</p>\n<p>For under age users with an account that is inactive for twelve months or more (meaning the account has not received a message through the Services in that time), Remind's policy is to disable access to Personal Information associated with that account.\n</p>\n<p>If your or your child's Personal Information changes, or you no longer desire to use our Services, or you would like to rescind permission for Remind to further contact your child, you may review, correct, update, delete inaccuracies, request deletion of your child's information, or amend it by logging into your account and making those changes or contacting us at rmd.me/help or privacy@remindhq.com.\nWe will respond to your request as quickly as possible.\n</p>\n<p>We will retain your or your child's information for as long as your

are requesting to delete was uploaded or otherwise provided by a Verified Administrator of an Organization to which you belong (for example, through CSV or SIS integration), then you must request deletion of that information directly from the Organization.\nRemind may inform the Organizer(s) and/or Organization(s) you are affiliated with when you request to delete your Remind account.\n</p>\n<p>If your school or school district has paid for a Plan and the school or district chooses to end their contract with Remind for that Plan service you will be able to use Remind's free services.\nIf your school or district subsequently requests termination of all services and deletion of accounts, Remind will offer you the choice whether to continue using Remind, and if so, provide you with control over your Remind account.\nIf in that instance you as a user wish to delete your service we will honor that request.\n</p>California Residents - Exercise of Rights<p>If you
