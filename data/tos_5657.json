Services include Peppa Pig, PJ Masks, Ben and Holly, and Ricky Zoom websites and/or mobile apps that link to these terms.</p>\n<p>This website and/or mobile app is operated by Secret Location, a subsidiary of Entertainment One UK Limited.</p>\n<p>Parents or guardians should read this Privacy Policy and explain to any children using this website and/or mobile app the implications of this Privacy Policy.</p>\nAbout us\n<p>This website and/or mobile app is operated by Entertainment One UK Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, with company number 02989602, and whose registered office is at 45 Warren Street, London, W1T 6AG, UK (eOne, we, us).</p>\n<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy.\nThis privacy policy (Privacy Policy) tells you how we collect, store, process and use your/your children\u2019s personal information when you use this website and/or mobile app (the Services).\nIt also provides you with details about your rights in relation to your/your children\u2019s personal information.\nYou should read this Privacy Policy in conjunction with our&nbsp;Terms of Use</p>\n<p>Our legal status is that of a \u201cdata controller\u201d and in this capacity we will securely store and process your/your children\u2019s personal information which you/your children have provided to us or which we otherwise collect.\nData controller is a legal term used in EU legislation to signify the person who controls what to do with any given personal information.\nWe are registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (registration number Z9919769).</p>\nChildren\n<p>The Services are designed partly for children.\nTherefore we are aware that we must be extra cautious when processing personal information.\nMost of our Services contain a children\u2019s section (the \u201cChildren\u2019s Area\u201d) and a separate parents\u2019 (or guardians\u2019) section (the \u201cGrown-Up Area\u201d).\nIn the Children\u2019s Area, children mainly participate only by playing games, reading e-books and/or watching videos.\nWe generally do not offer any place in the Children\u2019s Area where a child can sign up or enter personal information themselves.\nTypically, the only part of the Services where anyone can enter personal information directly is the Grown-Up Area.\nAccordingly, in most cases, we do not anticipate that we will be collecting personal information directly from any children.\nWe anticipate and assume that we will be collecting personal information only from parents or guardians.</p>\n<p>If you are under the age of 13, you may only use the Services and provide personal information if you have the consent of, and are supervised by, a parent or guardian.</p>\n<p>If we believe a child using the Services is under 13 we will not process any personal information of that child without the consent of the parent or guardian.\nIf the user is 13 or over we will only collect and process personal information as the long as we believe the user understands what is involved.</p>\n\u2028\u200bWhat personal information do we collect?\n<p>We may collect the following personal

as from our sub-contractors.</p>\nHow we may use your/your children\u2019s personal information\n<p>We (or third party data processors acting on our behalf) may collect, store and use your/your

regulations.</p>\n<p>We may also collect information about visitors to and users of the Services for the purposes of aggregate statistics or reporting purposes.</p>\nLegal basis for processing your personal information\n<p>We will only process your/your child\u2019s personal information where we have a legal basis to do so.\nThe legal basis will depend on the purposes for which we have collected and use the personal information.\nIn almost every case the legal basis will be one of the following:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Consent: For example, where you have provided your consent to receive certain marketing from us.\nYou can withdraw your consent at any time, including by clicking on the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link at the bottom of any marketing email we send you.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Our legitimate business interests: Where it is necessary for us to understand our customers, promote our services and operate effectively as a provider of children\u2019s content and related services, provided in each case that this is done in a legitimate way which does not unduly affect your or your child\u2019s privacy and other rights.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Compliance with law: Where we are subject to a legal obligation and need to use your personal information in order to comply with that obligation.</p>\nWhere we store your personal information\n<p>The personal information that we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d), including countries, which have less strict, or no data protection laws, when compared to those in Europe.</p>\n<p>Whenever we transfer your/your child\u2019s personal information as described in the paragraph above, we will take steps which are reasonably necessary to ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect such personal information and to make sure it is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.\nIn these cases, we rely on approved data transfer mechanisms (such as the EU \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d and the EU-US \u201cPrivacy Shield\u201d) to ensure your information is subject to adequate safeguards in the recipient country.\nIf you are located in the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place to protect your personal information and privacy rights in these circumstances.</p>\nHow we keep your personal information\n<p>We take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is retained for only as long as it is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected.\nAfter this period it will be deleted or in some cases anonymised.</p>\n<p>Where we have collected personal information based on your consent and we have no other lawful basis to continue with that processing, if you subsequently withdraw your consent then we will delete your personal information.\nHowever, please note that where you unsubscribe from our marketing communications, we will keep a record of your email address to ensure we do not send you marketing emails in future.</p>\nDo we share personal information with any third parties?\n<p>We may share your personal information within our group of

personal information to protect the rights, property or safety of us or our users, or others, and in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions (this includes exchanging information with other
