No.\nWe do not log search activity at a user-level.\nWe do collect statistics of the usage of our website at a high-level such as counting the total number of pageviews per day/week/month/year and the geographic location of our user base at a country level.\nThis helps us prioritize the allocation of development resources and better understand our infrastructure needs.\nIf you use one of our services such as our free voter registration service or contact us for customer support, any information that is provided in order to deliver the service to you or respond to your request is used solely for that purpose and not connected in any way with your searches.\nDo we store your search history? No.\nOther search engines store your search history in order to sell your information for advertising and other purposes.\nThey store your information and searches with a unique identifier which may be used to identify you in the future.\nWe do not use cookies to identify users, and we do not associate searches with users.\nUnlike other search engines that claim to offer user privacy but admit they save searches to improve things like misspellings, we don't store your searches at all.\nDo we share your search history? No.\nWe do not store or share your search history.\nYour searches are safe with us.\nDo we use cookies? No cookies are used by default.\nWe use cookies on our website to save your settings when you manually change the language to save your language settings.\nAs an example, the cookie might contain a two-letter country code such as \"FR\" or \"US\".\nNo personally-identifiable information is stored in cookies.\nCookies are not synced or shared.\nThird party links Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website.\nThese third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.\nWe therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.\nNonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.\nSources We partner with various sources to provide the information that powers our search engine.\nOur traditional web search results are powered by a major search engine not named Google.\nIn order to present the best search experience, our search partner may collect information such as IP address, user agent, and other information to provide search results.<br>\n<br>\nIn order to provide video search, we use YouTube API Services.\nUsage of YouTube is subject to the Google Privacy Policy.\nPlease note that we never collect or share your personal data to provide video search services.\nThird Party Stores The use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the Chrome Web Store User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.\nWe do not collect or share personal data from users of our extensions.\nFeedback Our
