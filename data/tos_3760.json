https://hybridtheory.com/do-not-sell</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nThis means that, in an event of any

cover the 12-month period preceding your request.\nThe response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.\nFor data portability requests, we will select
