BY LAW.\nBY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS YOU EXPLICITLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST WNI.</p>\n<p>This section includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding).\nPlease read it carefully.\nYou may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.</p>Informal Process First<p>You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and WNI, you will first contact WNI and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.</p>Arbitration Agreement<p>After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \"Claim\") relating in any way to your use of WNI's services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and WNI or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration.\nThis mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and WNI.\nHowever, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by WNI for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases.\nIf you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below.</p>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration.\nInstead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator.\nCourt review of an arbitration award is limited.\nExcept to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nYou agree that the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and WNI are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nThis arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Whip Networks, Inc., 1841 Centinela Ave., Santa Monica, CA 90404.\nThe arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nIf you are not an individual or have used the Service on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used.\nThe AAA's rules are available at http://www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p>\n<p>The number of arbitrators will be one.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the English language.\nMassachusetts law will apply.\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.\nIf you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.\nHowever, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \"Class Action Waiver\" section below.</p>\n<strong>Opt-Out of Arbitration</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with WNI and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to support@tvtime.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Service after these Terms are made effective.</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Any Claim must be brought in the respective party's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\"Class Action\").\nThe parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum.\nIf the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration.\nAny claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nThe parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and WNI each waive any right to a jury trial.</strong>\n</p>Venue and Governing Law<p>These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.\nexcept that aspects of the Service that are accessed from France may also be subject to the Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services transposed into French law by the Law Number 2004-575 of 21 June 2004 regarding confidence in the digital economy.\nExcept as otherwise provided in these Terms, you and WNI may litigate in the courts of Los Angeles, California to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\nAny Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles, California, and you and WNI agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>XV.\nCHANGES TO TERMS<p>We are constantly updating the Service, and that means we reserve the right to update these Terms for any reason.\nIf we

are not liable to you or to any third party for any changes, suspension, or restriction to, or termination of the Service.</p>\n<p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.\nAll provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including without limitation ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.\nOur rights under these Terms will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>XVII.\nGENERAL TERMS<p>If any part of these Terms is held invalid or
