location information, and communications between riders and drivers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud.\nFor example, if we determine by using such information that a

another party, we may share their order or trip information, including real-time location data, with the owner of that account.\nThis occurs, for example, when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A rider uses their employer\u2019s Uber for Business profile, such as when they take trips arranged through <u>Uber Central</u>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>A driver or delivery person uses an account owned by or associated with an Uber partner transportation company or restaurant<br>\n</li>\n<li>A rider takes a trip arranged by a friend or under a Family Profile<br>\n</li>\n<li>A delivery person acts as a substitute (UK only)<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>5- With Uber subsidiaries and affiliates</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We share data with our subsidiaries and affiliates to help us provide our services or conduct data processing on our behalf.\nFor example, Uber processes and stores data in the United States on behalf of its international subsidiaries and affiliates.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6- With Uber service

required by applicable law, regulation, operating license or agreement, legal process or governmental request, or where the disclosure is otherwise appropriate due to safety or similar concerns.\n</p>\n<p>This includes sharing personal data with law enforcement officials, public health officials, other government authorities, airports (if required by the airport authorities as a condition of operating on airport property), or other third parties as necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, user agreements, or other policies.\nto protect Uber\u2019s rights or property or the rights, safety, or property of others.\nor in the event of a claim or dispute relating to the use of our services.\nIf you use another person\u2019s credit card, we may be required by law to share your personal data, including trip or order information, with the owner of that credit card.</p>\n<p>Please see <u>Uber\u2019s Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities</u> for more information.</p>\n<p>This also includes sharing personal data with others in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8- With consent</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Uber may share a user\u2019s personal data other than as described in this notice if we notify the user and they consent to the sharing.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>E.\nData retention and deletion</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Uber retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time.\nUber may retain user data after a deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for the reasons stated in this policy.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Uber retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.\nThis means that we retain different categories of data for different periods of time depending on the category of user to whom the data relates, the type of data, and the purposes for which we collected the data.\n</p>\n<p>Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings &gt.\nPrivacy menus in the Uber app, or through Uber\u2019s website (riders and delivery recipients <u>here</u>.\ndrivers and delivery persons <u>here</u>).</p>\n<p>Following an account deletion request, Uber deletes the user\u2019s account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user\u2019s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute.\nBecause we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to drivers and delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for a minimum of 7 years after a deletion request.\nFor riders and delivery recipients, their data is generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.</p>\n<strong>F.\nGrounds for processing</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>We only collect and use personal data where we have lawful grounds to do so.\nThese include processing user personal data to provide requested services and features, for purposes of Uber\u2019s legitimate interests or those of other parties, to fulfill our legal obligations, or based on consent.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect and use personal data only where we have one or more lawful grounds for doing so.\nSuch grounds may vary depending on where our users are located, but generally include processing personal data: </p>\n<p>\n<strong>A- To provide requested services and features</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In order to provide our services, we must collect and use certain personal data.\nThis includes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>User profile data, which we use to establish and maintain user accounts.\nverify user identity.\ncommunicate with users about their trips, orders, and accounts.\nand enable users to make payments or receive earnings </li>\n<li>Background trip information, which is used to verify an applicant\u2019s eligibility to be a driver or delivery person</li>\n<li>Driver and delivery person location data, which we use to track trips and assist with navigation</li>\n<li>Usage data, which is necessary to maintain, optimize, and enhance Uber\u2019s services, including to determine incentives, connect riders and drivers, and calculate costs of trips and driver earnings</li>\n<li>Transaction information</li>\n<li>Information relating to customer support <br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>B- For purposes of the legitimate interests of Uber or other parties</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This includes using personal data to maintain and enhance our users\u2019 safety and security.\nFor example, we use personal data to prevent use of our services by users who have engaged in inappropriate or dangerous behavior, such as by retaining data of banned users to prevent their use of Uber\u2019s apps.\nWe also use usage data to prevent matching of riders and drivers for whom there is higher risk of conflict (for instance, because they have been the subject of prior complaints from other users).\n</p>\n<p>This also includes purposes such as combating fraud.\nimproving our services, direct marketing, research, and development.\nand enforcing Uber\u2019s Terms of Service.<br>\n<br>In addition, it includes using personal data to the extent necessary for the interests of other people or the general public, such as in connection with legal or insurance claims, and to protect the rights and safety of others.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C- To fulfill Uber\u2019s legal obligations </strong>\n</p>\n<p>For example, Uber is subject to laws and regulations in many cities and countries that require it to collect and retain data about our users\u2019 trips and deliveries, and to provide copies of such data to the government or other authorities.\nWe collect and use personal data to comply with such laws.\n</p>\n<p>Uber may also share data with law enforcement regarding criminal acts or threats to public safety, or requests by third parties pursuant to legal processes.\nUber may also share information with public health authorities where required or permitted by law.\nFor more information about such sharing, please see Uber\u2019s <u>Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities - United States</u>, <u>Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities - Outside the US</u>, and <u>Guidelines for Third Party Data Requests and Service of Legal Documents</u>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D- With consent </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Uber may collect and use personal data based on the user\u2019s consent.\nFor example, we may collect personal data through voluntary surveys.\nResponses to such surveys are collected on the basis of consent and will be deleted once no longer necessary for the purposes collected.\n<br>\n<br>A user who has provided consent to a collection or use of their personal data can revoke it at any time.\nHowever, the user will not be able to use any service or feature that requires collection or use of that personal data.</p>IV.\nChoice and transparency<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Uber enables users to access and control the data that Uber collects, including through: </em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>In-app settings</em>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Device permissions</em>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>In-app ratings pages</em>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Marketing opt-outs </em>\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Uber also enables users to request access to or copies of their data, changes or updates to their accounts, deletion of their accounts, or that Uber restrict its processing of user personal data.\n</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A- Privacy settings</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Settings menus in the Uber app for riders give them the ability to set or update their location-sharing preferences and their preferences for receiving mobile notifications from Uber.\nInformation about these settings, how to set or change these settings, and the effect of turning off these settings is described below.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Location data</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Uber uses riders\u2019 device location services to make it easier to get a ride whenever they need one.\nLocation data helps improve our services, including pickups, navigation, and customer support.\n</p>\n<p>Riders may enable or disallow Uber to collect location data from their mobile devices through the Settings &gt.\nPrivacy menus in the Uber app.\nRiders and delivery recipients can enable or disallow such collections through the settings on their mobile device.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Share Live Location (riders)</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Riders who have enabled Uber to collect location data from their mobile device may also enable Uber to share their location with their driver from the time the ride is requested to the start of the trip.\nThis can help improve pickups for both drivers and riders, particularly in crowded areas.</p>\n<p>Riders may enable or disable this feature through the Settings &gt.\nPrivacy menus in the Uber app.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Emergency Data Sharing (riders) </strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Riders who have enabled Uber to collect location data from their mobile device may also enable the Emergency Data Sharing feature that shares data with emergency police, fire, and ambulance services.\nSuch data includes approximate location at the time the emergency call was placed.\nthe car\u2019s make, model, color, and license plate information.\nthe rider\u2019s name and phone number.\npickup and dropoff locations.\nand the driver\u2019s name.<br>\n<br>Riders may enable or disable this feature through the Settings &gt.\nPrivacy menus or the Safety Center in the Uber app.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Notifications: account and trip updates</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Uber provides users with trip status notifications and updates related to activity on their account.\nThese notifications are a necessary part of using the Uber app and cannot be disabled.\nHowever, users may choose the method by which they receive these notifications through the Settings &gt.\nPrivacy menus in the Uber app.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Notifications: discounts and news</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users may enable Uber to send push notifications about discounts and news from Uber.\nPush notifications may be enabled or disabled through the Settings &gt.\nPrivacy menus in the Uber app.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications from restaurant partners </strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Delivery recipients who have opted in to communications from restaurant partners may stop sharing their data with each restaurant partner in their Uber Eats account settings.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B- Device permissions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without the device owner\u2019s permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that permission can be obtained.\niOS devices notify users the first time the Uber app requests permission to access certain types of data and gives users the option to grant or refuse permission.\nAndroid devices notify users of the permissions that the Uber app seeks before their first use of the app, and use of the app constitutes a grant of such permission.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C- Ratings look-up</strong>\n</p>\n<p>After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5.\nAn average of those ratings is associated with a user\u2019s account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services.\nFor example, rider ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their riders.\n</p>\n<p>This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior.\nAccountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders.\n</p>\n<p>Riders can see their average rating in the main menu of the Uber app.\n</p>\n<p>Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the Uber Driver app.</p>\n<p>Delivery persons are also rated by delivery recipients and restaurant partners.\nClick <u>here</u> for more information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D- Marketing opt-outs</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Users may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Uber <u>here</u>.\nUsers may also opt out of receiving emails and other messages from Uber by following the unsubscribe instructions in those messages.\nWe may still send users who have opted out non-promotional communications, such as receipts for rides or information about their account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E- User data requests </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Uber provides users with a variety of ways to learn about, control, and submit questions and comments about Uber\u2019s handling of their data.\nTo make a request, please go <u>here</u>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Accessing data:</strong> Users can ask for an explanation of the data we collect from them and how we use it.\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Receiving data:</strong> Users can ask for a copy of data that Uber collects from them with their consent or as necessary to

through the Settings menu in Uber\u2019s apps or driver portal.\nThey may also ask that Uber change or update their data, including if they believe such data is inaccurate or incomplete.\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deleting data:</strong> Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings &gt.\nPrivacy menus in the Uber app, or through Uber\u2019s

applications, websites, content, products, and services (the \"Services,\" as more fully defined below in Section 3) made available in the United States and its territories and possessions by Uber USA, LLC and its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and directors (collectively, \"Uber\").\nPLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND UBER.\nIn these Terms, the words \"including\" and \"include\" mean \"including, but not limited to.\"</p>\n<p>By accessing or using the Services, you confirm your agreement to be bound by these Terms.\nIf you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services.\nThese Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you regarding the use of the Services.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, these Terms do not supersede or otherwise impact the enforceability of any agreements you may have with Uber or its subsidiaries regarding driving, delivering and/or providing transportation and/or delivery services (e.g.\nthe Platform Access Agreement, the Technology Services Agreement and/or any similar agreements).\nTo the extent (but only to the extent) any agreement you may have with Uber regarding driving, delivering and/or providing transportation and/or delivery services conflicts with these Terms, those agreements (and not these Terms) will prevail.\n</p>\n<p>Uber may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH UBER ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.\nBY ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IMPORTANT DECISION.</p>\n<p>Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, program, activity or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in separate region-specific disclosures (e.g., a particular city webpage on Uber.com) or in connection with the applicable Service(s).\nSupplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Service(s).\nSupplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.</p>\n<p>Uber may amend the Terms from time to time.\nAmendments will be effective upon Uber's posting of such updated Terms at this location or in the amended policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service(s).\nYour continued access or use of the Services after such posting confirms your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.\nIf Uber changes these Terms after the date

you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against Uber on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement.\nThis will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against Uber, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against Uber by someone else.</p>Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Uber.<p>You and Uber agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Uber, and not in a court of law.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, where you allege claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in connection with your use of the Services, you may elect to bring those claims in a court of competent jurisdiction instead of arbitration.\nUber agrees to honor your election of forum with respect to your individual sexual assault or sexual harassment claim but in so doing does not waive the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other provision (including, but not limited to, the waivers provided in the following paragraph, which will continue to apply in court and arbitration), controversy, claim or dispute.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that you and Uber are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.\nUnless both you and Uber otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.\nHowever, you and Uber each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p>Rules and Governing Law.<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in accordance with the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \"AAA Rules\") then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nThe AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>\n<p>The parties agree that the arbitrator (\"Arbitrator\"), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq.\n(\"FAA\"), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto.\nIt is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nIf the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of California.</p>Process.<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879).\nThe Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>Location and Procedure.<p>Unless you and Uber otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Uber submit to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>Arbitrator's Decision.<p>The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so.\nThe Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.\nAn Arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be final and binding on all parties.\nAn Arbitrator\u2019s decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.\nUber will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Uber may have under applicable law to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if Uber prevails in arbitration.</p>Fees.<p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Uber will pay all such fees, unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>Changes.<p>Notwithstanding the provisions in Section I above, regarding consent to be bound by amendments to these Terms, if Uber changes this Arbitration Agreement after the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Uber written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the \"Effective\" date above.\nThis written notice must be provided either (a) by mail or hand delivery to our registered agent for service of process, c/o Uber USA, LLC (the name and current contact information for the registered agent in each state are available online here), or (b) by email from the email address associated with your Account to: change-dr@uber.com.\nIn order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement.\nBy rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Uber in accordance with the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms).</p>Severability and Survival.<p>If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or

necessary to grant Uber the license to the User Content as set forth above.\nand (ii) neither the User Content, nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content, nor Uber's use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>\n<p>You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by Uber in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law.\nUber may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User

booking fee, municipal tolls, airport surcharges or processing fees for split payments.\nPlease visit www.uber.com/cities for further information on your particular location.</p>\n<p>All Charges and payments will be enabled by Uber using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which you will receive a receipt by email.\nIf your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Uber may use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.\nCharges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Uber.</p>\n<p>As between you and Uber, Uber reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Uber's sole discretion.\nFurther, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand.\nUber will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.\nUber may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you.\nYou may elect to cancel your request for Services at any time prior to the commencement of such Services, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee on a Third Party Provider\u2019s behalf.\nAfter you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback.\nUber may use the proceeds of any Charges for any purpose, subject to any payment obligations it has agreed to with any Third Party Providers or other third parties.</p>\n<p>In certain cases, with respect to Third Party Providers, Charges you incur will be owed directly to Third Party Providers, and Uber will collect payment of those charges from you, on the Third Party Provider\u2019s behalf as their limited payment collection agent, and payment of the Charges shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider.\nIn such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Charges you incur will be owed to the Third Party Provider.\nUber will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.\nThis payment structure is intended to fully compensate a Third Party Provider, if applicable, for the services or goods obtained in connection with your use of the Services.\nIn all other cases, Charges you incur will be owed and paid directly to Uber or its affiliates, where Uber is solely liable for any obligations to Third Party Providers.\nIn such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from Uber for services or goods received by you from a Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Uber will respond accordingly to any request from you to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.\nExcept with respect to taxicab transportation services requested through the Application, Uber does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to a Third Party Provider.\nAny representation by Uber (on Uber's website, in the Application, or in Uber's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is \"voluntary,\" \"not required,\" and/or \"included\" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Uber provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to a Third Party Provider you may use.\nYou understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so.\nGratuities are voluntary.</p>Repair, Cleaning or Lost and Found Fees.<p>You shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, vehicles and property resulting from use of the Services under your Account in excess of normal \"wear and tear\" damages and necessary cleaning (\"Repair or Cleaning\").\nIn the event that a Repair or Cleaning request is verified by Uber in Uber's reasonable discretion, Uber reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning using your payment method designated in your Account.\nSuch amounts, as well as those pertaining to lost and found goods, will be transferred by Uber to a Third Party Provider, if applicable, and are non-refundable.</p>\n<p>The amounts related to repair, cleaning or lost &amp.\nfound fees applicable in Puerto Rico may be found at https://www.uber.com/es-US/blog/puerto-rico/puerto-rico-terminos-y-condiciones/ and may be updated from time to time solely by Uber.</p>6.\nDisclaimers.\nLimitation of

California, U.S.A., without giving effect to any conflict of law principles, except as may be otherwise provided in the Arbitration Agreement above or in supplemental terms applicable to your

law whether that be by statute, common law, or otherwise.\nThese provisions, and except as otherwise provided in Section 2 of these Terms, are only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret these Terms and the forum for disputes asserting a breach of these Terms, and these provisions shall not be interpreted as generally extending California law to you if you do not otherwise

described in Section 2, the Federal Arbitration Act shall apply to any such disputes.</p>Claims of Copyright Infringement.<p>Claims of copyright infringement should be sent to Uber's designated
