your personal information to provide you with Services and to maintain your trust in Trade Me and the people who use it.\nWe also use your personal information with information from others so that we

information to detect and prevent fraud, spam, abuse, security incidents, and other harmful activity (e.g.\nif we believe you have used another person\u2019s payment card or payment details without

engage a credit reporter to assist us with this).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 3.4 For advertising and marketing, for example to: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Send you promotional messages, marketing or

(including on-site display advertising), and other information that may be of interest to you (including information about our business partners).\nFor clarity, products and services advertised on our websites (e.g.\non-site display ads showing messages from third parties) are not endorsed by Trade Me.\nWe may make advertising space available on our websites through certain advertising platforms or exchanges, such as DoubleClick Ad Exchange, and you can manage what you see on our sites due to DoubleClick cookies through Google\u2019s Ad Settings.\nIf you opt out of customised third-party advertising, the advertising you see on our websites may be less relevant to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tailor our advertising and marketing to you once you\u2019ve left our websites.</strong> We may send or show you promotional messages, marketing, advertising, and other information that may be of interest to you once you\u2019ve left our websites.\nWe may advertise to you in this way through certain advertising platforms such as Google Marketing Platform or Facebook.\nIf you opt out of tailored remarketing, we won\u2019t use your personal information for remarketing, but you may still see similar ads based on your browsing history, non-personal cookie data or other anonymous information.\nYou can further control what ads of ours you see off-site in various ways, for example through

profile</strong>.\nParts of your public profile page, such as your user name and your region may be publicly visible to others.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your listing content</strong>.\nWe may make listing content publicly available on the applicable Service when you publish it (and in such cases, you are solely responsible for such publication).\nListing content will also be available to people who use our API (e.g.\ndevelopers) and may appear on other websites or applications (see clause 4 below).\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your feedback</strong>.\nA number of our Services allow Users to provide feedback and rate each other.\nThese may be publicly available on our Services.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Comments on message boards</strong>.\nIf you submit content on a message board, social media post or other similar feature on our Services, that content will be publicly visible.</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 3.6 For other things, with your express consent.\n<ul>\n<li>We may disclose your information at your direction, or otherwise as you agree with us.\nPlease note that we:</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not have access to your passwords.</li>\n<li>Only use your credit card details for purposes related to your transactions and for fraud prevention or law enforcement purposes.</li>\n<li>Have included some Service-specific terms below, which cover how we use your information for particular Services.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 3.7 To measure traffic on our sites and Services.\n<ul>\n<li>We may use your information to measure traffic across our sites, apps and Services, to analyse trends and to help us understand how our Services are performing and whether they are meeting the needs of our customers.\nWe use Nielsen digital measurement software to measure this for us.\nNielsen collects anonymous information, like the number of people who visit our sites &amp.\napps, how many pages are viewed, and how long people stay on our site.\nNielsen may also randomly ask you to complete anonymous short site surveys - these are totally optional.\nNielsen then aggregates this information and combines it with other information from third parties to provide measurement of user engagement across our sites and apps.</li>\n<li>You can opt-out of some Nielsen measurement.\nBecause the Nielsen measurement is anonymous, if you use both our site and our apps, or if you use our site across multiple browsers, you\u2019ll need to opt-out for each device and browser.\nThat\u2019s because Nielsen doesn\u2019t know who you are and therefore can\u2019t opt you out across the board (sorry!).\nTo learn more about Nielsen and how to opt-out, go here.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 4.\nWho do we disclose your information to? <p>We may need to disclose your personal information to others to provide you with our Services, to improve our Services or uphold the law or our terms.\nTo help build your trust, we produce an Annual Transparency Report which details disclosures we have made for law enforcement purposes.\nAs described above, we may disclose your information to our Trade Me Affiliated Services (unless you have opted out of these disclosures).\nWe may also disclose your personal information in the following ways:</p>\n</li>\n<li> 4.1 To others with your consent, for example when you: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Ask us or authorise us</strong>.\nWe\u2019ll share your information when you authorise us to send this to a third party (e.g.\nAfterpay or a job advertiser).\nFor example, if you use Trade Me and are a buyer or seller in respect of a listing, you authorise us to release your name, email address and other contact details to the other party to facilitate the trade after the listing closes.\nLikewise, if you use Holiday Houses, Viewing Tracker or Tenancy Tracker, we may disclose your personal information between Users to facilitate the Service.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Authorise third party access</strong>.\nWe may share your information when you authorise a third party application to access your information.\nThis is most common for Top Sellers (e.g.\nwho use Tradevine), and other professional listers (e.g.\nmotor vehicle dealers, property agents and recruiters).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 4.2 To other users in certain cases, for example: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Your trading history</strong>.\nYour membership trading history is published in your feedback if someone places feedback about you.\nAlthough we allow this functionality, the person posting feedback is solely responsible for the content of their feedback.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Dispute information (subject to a statutory declaration)</strong>.\nIn rare circumstances we may disclose contact details of one User to another User (e.g.\nsee cause 4.5 below).\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 4.3 To our service providers, to provide and manage our Services.\n<ul>\n<li>In order to provide and manage our Services, we may need to disclose some of your personal information to our third party service providers.\nThese providers have limited access to your personal information to perform tasks on our behalf, (such as cloud-storage providers.\nmarketing partners.\ndata analytics or research partners.\nthird parties that help us to enhance the safety and security of the Service.\nwhere required, to international regulators (for example, for tax purposes).\nand our consultants, lawyers, accountants, insurers, and professional advisors) and are contractually obliged to use your personal information consistently with this Privacy Policy.\nThese disclosures will be consistent with the Service-specific terms and the rest of this privacy policy.</li>\n<li>Some of these service providers are located outside of New Zealand and may not be subject to New Zealand privacy laws.\nHowever, we will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to confirm that those organisations are required to protect the information in a way that, overall, provides comparable safeguards to those under the Privacy Act 2020.\nBy using the Service and otherwise providing us with your information, you authorise such disclosure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 4.4 To other third parties, such as: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Developers who use our API to build applications</strong>.\nIf you use Trade Me, we provide application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow developers to build new applications that include our data.\nUsers of our API must agree to our API terms and conditions.\nSome applications may deliver services to you that ask you to log in to connect to Trade Me (via the application).\nThese applications will not be able to retrieve your Trade Me password, but will be able to access your current listing content and other personal information to the extent you have authorised access.\nFor example, some applications, with your authorisation, may be able to access information within your My Trade Me such as your watchlist, sold items or personal contact details.\nYou should only allow applications to access your information if you trust them.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Afterpay, if you buy or sell with them</strong>.\nIf you use the \u201cAfterpay Service\u201d to conduct a transaction (either as a buyer or a seller), we may disclose your personal information to Afterpay NZ Limited (\u201cAfterpay\u201d) or a related company of Afterpay where necessary to: (i) facilitate payments under the Afterpay Service.\n(ii) help with resolution of a dispute (including where our Buyer Protection Policy applies).\n(iii) help process a refund, chargeback and/or reversal.\n(iv) report suspicious or potentially fraudulent activity on the website in connection with the Afterpay Service.\n(v) allow suspension of the Afterpay Service where a seller\u2019s sales through the Afterpay Service disproportionately lead to a buyer\u2019s default on payment obligations to Afterpay.\nor (vi) ensure Afterpay can enforce any contractual rights given for Afterpay\u2019s benefit under our Afterpay terms for Trade Me sellers.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Job advertisers and recruiters, via Trade Me Jobs.</strong> If you apply for a job on Trade Me Jobs, we may send the advertiser your job application (including CV and other documents such as cover letters) and other personal information.\nThe advertiser may also be able to access your job application, and other personal information submitted for the job, via our applicant tracking system.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertisers providing customised ads, unless you opt out</strong>.\nWe may give advertisers your personal information to facilitate them sending you promotional messages, marketing, advertising, and other information that may be of interest to you (unless you opt out or unsubscribe).\nThis may be provided on our Services or on services provided by those advertisers.\nThe advertiser\u2019s own privacy policy will apply to the personal information we send them.\nDepending on the privacy policy of the advertiser, the advertiser may combine the personal information we give them with personal information they hold about you, to assist with their advertising to you.\nThis is particularly relevant for Google\u2019s Customer Match and Facebook Custom Audience.\nVisit our Remarketing help page to learn more.\nIf any personal information is shared, we require that it is done so securely.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Insurers and advisers (with your permission) if you use Trade Me Insurance</strong>.\nIf you use Trade Me Insurance, we may give your insurance application form and other personal information to our underwriter (Tower) so that they can facilitate your insurance.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Users of Tailored Products</strong>.\nSome of our Services provide tailored personal information to the users of those Services.\nThose Services will have their own customisable settings, so you can choose whether you want to share your information.\nFor example, if you have an active Trade Me Job Profile, subject to your profile settings (e.g., whether you make your information public or not), we may share your Trade Me Job Profile with recruiters and job advertisers that use our Trade Me Jobs candidate database .\nWe call our products that provide tailored personal information \u201cTailored Products\u201d.\nWhen we are developing any Tailored Products, Trade Me will ensure that your personal information is processed fairly and that the recipients of the personal information are contractually restricted in respect of their use of your personal information (e.g.\nfor users of our Trade Me Jobs candidate database, to contacting you about a particular role).\nIf we develop a Tailored Product that doesn\u2019t have its own customisable settings, then if you\u2019re opted out we will not disclose your information to users of the Tailored Product.\nYou can find out information about each Trade Me Service which provides tailored personal information.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 4.5 To authorities or other entities to uphold the law or our terms, for example: <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>For legal compliance or law enforcement purposes</strong>.\nWe may disclose your personal information to courts, law enforcement or government agencies, or third parties, to the extent we believe that disclosure is appropriate or permitted by the Privacy Act.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To facilitate legal processes</strong>.\nIf you wish to take Disputes Tribunal (or other) proceedings against another User, you can contact us for a statutory declaration form which must be completed before we will consider releasing anyone else's information to you.\nYou may only request contact details for the sole purpose of making a claim.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To enforce or apply our terms and conditions or policies</strong>.\nDespite anything else in this clause 4.5, if you are involved in a dispute to which our Buyer Protection Policy applies, you authorise us to (at our discretion) provide the other party with any correspondence or evidence relevant to the dispute which you\u2019ve provided to us.\nIn limited circumstances, we may also provide your contact details to the other party to help resolve the dispute (but will always seek your permission first).\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To protect the rights, property or safety of us, our Users or others</strong>.\nThis includes collecting money you owe us and making such disclosures as are necessary for the purpose of trust, safety and assurance in accordance with clause 3.3 above (e.g.\nwe have authorisation to access name and address details registered in respect of a vehicle on the motor vehicle register for fraud prevention purposes).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 4.6 To our other Services.\n<ul>\n<li>We may disclose your personal

parties, where your identity is anonymised.\n<ul>\n<li>We may share non-personally identifiable information (e.g., aggregated information about our Users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual User), for industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.\nFor example, we may disclose aggregated

are committed to keeping your personal information as safe and secure as possible and follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\n</li>\n<li>We continuously implement and update our administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorised access, loss, destruction, or alteration.\nHowever, despite all of our measures we can\u2019t 100% guarantee the security of the transmission or storage of your personal information.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> 5.2 We store your information in New Zealand or overseas subject to standards that will comply with our privacy obligations <ul>\n<li>You authorise us to transfer, store, and process your personal information in New Zealand and possibly other countries.\nWhere we store information overseas, or a third party we use to provide our Services stores

reasonably required, unless we are legally required to hold it longer.\n<ul>\n<li>We will keep your personal information for as long as is reasonably required for us to use it in accordance with this

necessary for business purposes, to help prevent fraud or facilitate legal processes).</li>\n<li>All listing content after listings have expired.\nWe do this for various reasons, including in case of disputes, to help prevent fraud and facilitate legal processes, to comply with financial record-keeping and to help personalise or recommend products in future.\nListing content may also persist elsewhere when third parties access and cache listings while they are live.\nFor example, Google do this when they index the web for searching and so old listings may show in Google searches for a period of time.</li>\n<li>Trade Me Jobs information.\nHowever, if you delete a CV or other document from Trade Me Jobs, the item will be immediately removed from your list of stored documents and deleted from our systems within seven days.\nOtherwise, documents you upload will expire and be deleted after five years.</li>\n<li>Motorweb (New Zealand) vehicle information reports (VIRs), including

life easier for you, we may use your saved card information for other Services we offer where you\u2019re able to make card payments).\nFor example, if you use a credit or debit card for our Ping or Pay Now Services, you may have the option to \u201csave this card for next time\u201d (or an option to similar effect) and if you choose this option, your credit or debit card details will be
