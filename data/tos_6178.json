closes.</p>\n<p>In order to run our online competitions, we ask for the entrant to send in their answers to play@beano.com with no other personal information.\nIf the entrant has been selected as a winner, we will contact the winner(s) asking for a parent or guardian email address.\nOnce the entrant has given this, we will then contact the parent or guardian to confirm their consent to sending the prize and to confirm delivery details.\nOnce the competition has concluded all email addresses will be deleted from our records.\nEmail addresses will not be used for any other purposes.</p>

process and the data collected is not used to profile or target a child as it cannot be linked to an individual.\nAggregated and anonymised data may be shared with 3rd parties.</p>\n<p>The questions asked via \u2018TRQs\u2019 may sometimes be sponsored by 3rd parties so they can better understand the opinions of our audience at an aggregate and anonymised data level.\nWhen a TRQ is sponsored it
