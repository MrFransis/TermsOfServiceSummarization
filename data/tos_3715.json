many channels, such as websites, apps, audio, smart TVs, and other video.\nThe advertising campaigns run by our clients help pay for the content you enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>We, and our clients, collect and use data both to help ensure that the ads you see are relevant and to measure and report on their effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Our AdBrain product, which is part of our Platform, uses data to produce a mapping of devices that might be related to each other, meaning that they might be used by the same person or by people within the same household.\nThis helps advertisers better target and measure their campaigns, as well as limiting the number of times the same person or household sees an ad.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Our references to our Platform in this policy only refer to the Trade Desk\u2019s own

websites, mobile applications, smart televisions, video devices, and other media</li>\n<li>using cookies and pixels</li>\n<li>from clients and partners uploading data to our platform</li>\n<li>from clients and partners using our technology to collect data</li>\n<li>through the delivery of advertising</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>The purposes for which the Platform processes

the choices available to you.\nIf after reading this policy you still have questions, please feel free to contact us at <strong>privacy</strong> ((at)) <strong>thetradedesk</strong> ((dot)) <strong>com</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>THE PLATFORM</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Platform allows advertisers and advertising agencies to manage digital advertising campaigns.\nWe operate as a Demand Side Platform.\nmeaning, we represent the demand side of the digital advertising marketplace, in which advertisers and agencies with ads to display are the \u201cdemand\u201d and publishers with space for such ads on web pages, apps, smart TVs and other digital properties are the \u201csupply\u201d.</p>\n<p>Digital advertising uses data to make ads more effective and to measure their effectiveness.\nWithout data our advertiser clients wouldn\u2019t know, for example, if 100 different users each saw an ad, or if one user saw the same ad 100 times.\nThis data is crucial to online and mobile content.\nWithout data like this, advertisers would pay publishers much less, forcing publishers to either show more ads or make users pay for their content.</p>\n<p>Advertisers and their agencies collect and use data on the Platform in different ways.\nThey may bring their own data to the Platform, collect data using the Platform, or remove their data from the Platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>THE DATA THE PLATFORM COLLECTS AND PROCESSES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Platform collects and processes pseudonymous data about users, devices, and ads and where they\u2019re shown.\nThis includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unique cookie identifiers</li>\n<li>mobile device advertising identifiers</li>\n<li>IP addresses</li>\n<li>interest information stored and/or used on the platform by clients and partners</li>\n<li>interest information we create</li>\n<li>other information about browsers and devices, such as type, version and settings</li>\n<li>location information based on IP address or latitude/longitude coordinates, if provided to us</li>\n<li>information about ads that are shown, such as which ads are shown to a device or user, where (which web page or app) they are shown, and at what time</li>\n<li>hashed email addresses and other identifying information (or information derived from such)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Platform collects and processes Unified ID 2.0.\nTo learn more click here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>HOW THE PLATFORM COLLECTS DATA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Platform receives data in several ways, including the following:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advertisers and agencies may bring or collect their own information via features on our Platform (for example, that they collect on their own websites) that we then store and use on their behalf to enhance their advertising campaigns.</li>\n<li>Bid requests, which are sets of information that describe an ad space that is available to be filled.\nWe get these requests from the \u201csupply\u201d side of the advertising ecosystem, meaning websites, apps, smart TVs, and others, as well as their agents.\nThe requests contain information about the ad space, the device, and sometimes the user, including location information.\nThey also usually have an ID that enables us to match the request with information we may already have.</li>\n<li>Third-party suppliers of information used to target and optimize advertising campaigns (for example, by personalizing ads).</li>\n<li>Purveyors of connected TV devices and apps can send us information about the video content viewed on the device or app.\n</li>\n<li>Pixels and cookies, which allow us to recognize web browsers across sites and over time, and therefore to record information about them over time.</li>\n<li>Mobile device IDs, which are provided by the device operating systems, like Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android, for purposes of allowing mobile apps and their advertising partners to recognize a device over time.\nWe use these IDs the same way we use cookies.</li>\n<li>Mobile SDKs are bits of code that some of our partners enable to be placed in mobile apps.\nThis enables our partners to send us data about the mobile app and device in association with the mobile device ID.</li>\n<li>After an ad serves, our servers receive a network request from the device on which the ad was shown in order to confirm that the ad was delivered and provide information for us to measure the ad.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<br>\n</strong>\n<strong>COOKIES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies help us by enabling our ability to distinguish between, recognize, and store data about unique web browsers and devices, and to store data on our servers for the advertising purposes described here.\nOur cookie domain is adsrvr.org.\nThe Trade Desk ID (TDID) is the main cookie and ID used to recognize web-browser profiles over time across sites.\nThe TDID has a lifespan of 1 year from the time you last received an ad from the Platform.\nThis lifespan may be updated each time you interact with the Platform.</p>\n<p>In order to be able to transmit requests for ads, and other data about users or devices, between sellers and buyers, and to help show you ads that match your likely interests, we engage in cookie syncing, meaning that we match our cookie IDs to clients\u2019 and partners\u2019 cookie IDs.\nWe also use non-unique cookies to store cookie-based opt-out choices, when users opt out of targeted advertising.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE PLATFORM PROCESSES DATA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Platform processes data both on our own behalf and on behalf of clients and partners for purposes related to targeting, delivering, measuring and reporting on advertising.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personalizing ads: We use data to increase advertising relevancy and effectiveness.</li>\n<li>Ad delivery: We may use data to technically deliver an ad and measure success of delivery.</li>\n<li>Frequency and other reporting: We use data to keep track of how many times an ad was shown, as well as where and when.</li>\n<li>Measurement and analytics: We use data to measure how well ads perform, such as whether users clicked on the ad or went to a client\u2019s store after their ad campaign was shown.</li>\n<li>Reporting: We may use data to measure, attribute, and report on the performance and success of campaigns.\nThis includes transaction reporting and verification.</li>\n<li>Clicks and conversions: We may use data to measure actions taken by a user with respect to a particular ad, i.e., a click on an ad, or a download of an app.</li>\n<li>Attribution: We may use data to match particular ad views to subsequent actions taken by a user.\nFor example, a car advertiser might be able to see that someone who saw an ad for a car four times, purchased that car.\nThis would be done by stitching together data collected from our Platform with the advertiser\u2019s own data and data from other companies.\nIn doing so, we don\u2019t receive any data that allows us to directly identify the purchaser of the car.</li>\n<li>Cross device graphing: We may use data and algorithms to associate devices that might be related to each other, such as devices used by the same person or in the same household.</li>\n<li>Detection of malicious or invalid activity: We process information in an attempt to prevent malicious activity or invalid ad traffic.\nThis may include identifying and preventing purveyors of malware or bots that try to take advertising dollars for ads that aren\u2019t shown to real users or that try to harm users\u2019 devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>MORE ABOUT PERSONALISATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As part of our Platform, we may create and use user profiles associated with unique IDs.\nThis means that we look at the information associated with the IDs and with the requests for ads, such as the content in which the ad is shown, the time, the geographic location, and the type of device.\nSometimes we use information about whether or how users responded to ads to find other users who would respond to ads.\nWe apply various computational methods on this information to find groupings of IDs that may have certain common interests or characteristics, such as \u201cclothing,\u201d \u201csports,\u201d \u201ctravel,\u201d \u201cmale,\u201d \u201c25-54,\u201d and so on.\nOur Platform also enables data suppliers to bring data to the Platform that our clients can use on the Platform to improve their ad campaigns.</p>\n<p>Clients can bring their own data to the Platform for their own personalisation.\nTheir sources and methods for acquiring this data vary and are subject to our clients\u2019 own policies and legal obligations.\nWe contractually prohibit certain types of data from being introduced onto the Platform, such as sensitive data, as further described below.</p>\n<p>As required under the NAI Code, the Trade Desk discloses standard interest segments that are based on health related information or interests and political information or interests.\nthat it makes available in the Platform where permitted by law and self-regulatory rules.</p>\n<p>Data that is considered \u201csensitive\u201d or in special categories according to local rules, including data about children, is subject to restrictions on the Platform.\nSome examples of sensitive data may include your social security number and financial account numbers, and may also include information related to your health, such as information on certain past, present, or future medical conditions.\nOur contracts prohibit clients and partners from using data on the Platform that is from or about users that they know are children or that is considered sensitive or special.\nWe do not knowingly use such data on the Platform.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>EUROPEAN UNION CONTROLLER/PROCESSOR DESIGNATION AND LEGAL

personalised user interest segments that we create for our Platform, when we have appropriate permissions to do so.</p>\n<p>When we collect data for personalisation from requests for ads that we receive as described above, under EU law, we will use consent as our legal basis for doing so.</p>\n<p>We process data for other purposes when we have a legitimate interest in doing so and that interest is not outweighed by the rights or freedoms of individual data subjects.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SHARING AND TRANSFER</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this policy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of the data processed on the Platform belongs to our clients.\nWhen this is the case, our clients can take this data, such as

transfer it on to a third party acting as an agent on our behalf, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the third party\u2019s processing of the data is in accordance with the framework.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We transfer data from the EEA or Switzerland to the US under a valid transfer mechanism.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this policy and such mechanism, the terms of the transfer mechanism shall govern.</p>\n<p>We commit to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal data and are subject to enforcement by the US Federal Trade Commission.\nEU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our privacy policy should first contact us at <strong>privacy</strong> ((at))

resolve your complaint.\nPlease click here for more information or to submit a complaint.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SECURITY AND DATA RETENTION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We retain the pseudonymous data collected on

partner data.</p>\n<p>We have implemented security measures, including physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, to prevent the unauthorized access to, loss, misuse, or alteration of the information that our Platform collects.\nWe believe these measures are appropriate given the nature of the data and our systems, but we make no assurances in this policy about our ability to prevent any such event or the possible harm to you or any third party that could arise from it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Industry opt-out pages.\n</strong>The online
