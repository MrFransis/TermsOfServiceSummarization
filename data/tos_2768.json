advertisements that are tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>Unity has implemented a cookie management tool for its website.&nbsp.\nIn addition, you may also be able to control targeting as you browse the web through browser settings and other mechanisms.\nIf you do not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by third parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA).\nWhere applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at the&nbsp;NAI website, the&nbsp;DAA website, or the&nbsp;EIDAA website.\nUnity does not control these third-party-provided opt-out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>\n<p>If Unity delivers personalized advertising, Unity will provide notice and information about how you may be able to opt-out of such personalized advertisements.\n&nbsp;Such opportunity to opt out may occur through your device settings (See \u201cInformation and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devices\u201d below).</p>\n<p>Developers may use other third party advertising networks.\nIf you do not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by third parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA).\nWhere applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at the NAI website, the DAA website, or the EIAA website.\nUnity does not control these third-party provided opt-out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Unity uses Google, among others, to provide advertising through the Services and on third party websites.\nWe may use the following features based on Google Analytics for Display Advertising: Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.\nTo opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.</p>More choices regarding browser cookies and beacons and other tracking technologies<p>There are several browser plugins available to Users that want to be better informed about and have more control over the use of cookies and related technologies on their devices.\nSome popular ones are Ghostery and Abine.</p>Information and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devices<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As of the effective date of this policy, Apple and Google offered the owners of devices that use their operating systems, iOS and Android, options for limiting tracking and targeting in relation to ads.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Unity does not control your device level opt out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make through such mechanism or for the continued availability, accuracy, effectiveness, or location of that mechanism.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a device level opt-out mechanism may opt you out of all third party personalized advertisements, not just those delivered by Unity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you use an Apple device go here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you use an Android device, navigate to the google settings page, select ads and then choose to reset your Android Ad ID or opt-out of personalized

October 18, 2020</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Last Edit/Review:&nbsp.\nApril 27, 2021</p>1.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)<p>These FAQs provide a handy entry point to our longer and more comprehensive Privacy Policy (see Section 2 below).\nThey are intended to enhance rather than replace the important notices in the Privacy Policy, which governs our collection, use, storage, and sharing of the information that we collect or receive from you.</p>What's new as of April, 2021?<p>On April 27, 2021, we added information to add our VisualLive product to our privacy policy.\nPlease note instructions on how to order your data reports for this product.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On April 8, 2021, we made edits to the Privacy Policy to incorporate our privacy practices regarding ChilliConnect, Furioos, and Rest AR.\nWe also made updates to Section 13, to incorporate data subject rights provided for by LGPD and the Israel Protection of Privacy Law.\nFinally, we made some formatting and clarifying changes to other sections.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On October 18, 2020, we made edits to the Privacy Policy to incorporate our privacy practices regarding Artomatix, C\u00f3dice Software (Plastic SCM), deltaDNA, and Finger Food ATG.\nWe made some edits about the information we may collect as well as our use and sharing of it.\nWe expanded on how we determine our retention periods.\nWe added information relating to Canadian Privacy Rights.\nWe updated our EU address.\nWe updated our Third Party Ad Network Partners.\nFinally, we added a provision on biometric information related to forthcoming products and services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On August 17, 2020, we made an edit to Section 12 to provide an additional summary of rights for data collected in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On May 27, 2020, we made the following updates: We are updating our policy to include a reference to our service provider\u2019s privacy statement in Section 5.&nbsp.\nWe are notifying you by asking you to accept this new policy to be sure you see this update.&nbsp.\nPlease note if you do not pay your Unity fees by credit card, this change has no effect on you.&nbsp.\nOther changes on May 27, 2020 include an addition of three partners in Section 16 for ads network partners.&nbsp.\nNote players in the European Union have had this information available to consider prior to today.\nhowever, we will only now begin sharing ads data with those partners for EU players.&nbsp.\nFinally, we have added a section about features involving Unity\u2019s access to cameras on devices.&nbsp.\nYou will note there is similar language in the consent we request for access to the camera, and we do not collect images from your device at this time.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as of March 10, 2020, we are adding a last edit/review date.&nbsp.\nThe difference between an edit/review and an update is that \"updates\" involve material changes to our policy whereas edits are not material or simply indicate a review has occurred.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may make clarifying edits by giving additional examples.&nbsp.\nWhen we provide an update, you receive a notice to accept and read the changes, which are summarized in this first FAQ.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, we enhanced our FAQs in May 2018 to provide more examples of how we may use some of the data we collect.\nThese answers enhanced our prior explanations but are not intended to imply that these are new uses of collected data.\nAdditionally, if your data indicates you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), we have added information regarding new choices enabled for in-game advertising, and information on how you can exercise your data access and deletion (erasure) rights.\nWe have added the l\u201cData Privacy\u201d icon to our ads, dashboards, and other points of interaction:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This icon will show you where you can review your data and exercise your privacy choices.\nIt is meant as a helpful access point for viewing your personal data in the context of its use within Unity systems.\nFor those playing games where Unity ads appear, you may see the icon instead of the traditional information (\u201c\u2139\u201d) button.\nFor those using our software to build games, you may see it in a privacy dashboard.</p>I am a game developer that uses Unity software to build my game, what should I know?<p>You can access and update your information by logging into your Unity account on our website.\nWe use analytics services to understand how developers use our software in order to improve our software and services.\nWe also include certain device data collection in the runtime of the software, which is incorporated into the applications you create with the software.\nYou should be sure that your privacy policy explains to your players the variety of technical information that is collected and shared with third parties like Unity.\nIf you use Unity developer services such as Mobile Advertising, Unity Analytics, or deltaDNA services, read the applicable FAQs below and our&nbsp;Cookie Policy.</p>I visit Unity or its affiliates' websites, what should I know?<p>We collect log info, including IP address and device data, related to your visits to our site.\nWhen you post comments on our community pages and forums, other forum users will be able to see your username, photo and comments.\nWhen you post, you should assume that all the information you provide is public.</p>I play a game that was built with or uses certain Unity software, what should I know?<p>Unity has collected some or all of the following information about your device: unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFV for iOS devices and Android ID for Android devices).\nIP address.\ncountry of install (mapped from IP address).\ndevice manufacturer and model platform type (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, etc.) and the operating system and version running on your system or device.\nlanguage.\nCPU information such as model, the number of CPUs present, frequency, and instruction set support flags.\nthe graphics card type and vendor name.\ngraphics card driver name and version (e.g., \u201cnv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71\u201d).\nwhich graphics API is in use (e.g., \u201cOpenGL 2.1\u201d or \u201cDirect3D 9.0c\u201d).\namount of system and video RAM present.\ncurrent screen resolution.\nversion of the Unity Editor used to create the game.\nsensor flags (e.g., device support for gyroscope, touch pressure or accelerometer).\napplication or bundle identification (\u201capp ID\u201d) of the game installed.\nunique advertising identifiers provided for iOS and Android devices (e.g., IDFA or Android Ad ID).\nand a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it transmitted correctly.</p>\n<p>Some developers use Unity\u2019s Analytics, deltaDNA services and Ad services, which collect additional information (see FAQs on Unity Analytics, deltaDNA, and Unity Ads below for details).\nhowever, our usage of this data is largely for the following purposes.\nIn serving ads, we try to predict which ads will be of most interest to you based on the games you play and the ads you watch.\nFor Unity Analytics and deltaDNA, we assist developers to deliver the best game experience for you.\nFor example, game developers who use our software often standardize certain features to enhance game player experience, such as saving your place in a game.\nThis means that the game level you reached in your last session is where you will begin when you return to the game.\nDevelopers also need our assistance in tracking when you are eligible to redeem a reward within a game, such as when you have completed a challenge and get store credits to purchase new tools to play the game.\n&nbsp;In our Unity Analytics and deltaDNA services, some of your data points will also be rolled up into an anonymized, aggregated format to help game developers make decisions about how they support their games.\nFor example, if a game developer is considering phasing out support for an older version of iOS software, they may look at the total number of players currently using that version of iOS software to determine if they need to support that version in updates.&nbsp.\nAnother use on a per game basis is when a developer analyzes the numbers of players dropping out after a certain level.&nbsp.\nThe developer would use this information to look at the design of their game and re-assess if the game challenge is truly intuitive or needs some additional instruction for players.&nbsp.\nThis allows the developer to enhance the experience and retain the developer\u2019s customers better.</p>\n<p>Some Unity developers may collect your information independent of Unity.\nUnity does not have control over this information.\nIf you want to request access to or deletion of this information, then check each developer\u2019s app settings or website for instructions on how to make a request.</p>I play a game that uses Unity Analytics of deltaDNA, what do I need to know?<p>Unity has collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, as well as events completed or actions taken within the game, including level, number of credits, time it took you to earn them, metadata about in-game communications and the value and details of purchases.\nUsing our systems, the developer of the game has ongoing access to this data.\nThis collection and use of data makes it possible for your experience to operate as expected by permitting you to do&nbsp;things like redeem rewards you have earned or return to where you left off in a game.\nOther Unity customers may have access to aggregated reports about game activity in general across a number of games.\nThese reports are based, in part, on your game activities, but do not specifically identify you or your device.\nThe reports described in this paragraph help developers make decisions on optimal methods to run the games they have made for you.\nFor example, the developer may need to know the types of devices running the game to determine how to support game updates on an ongoing basis.&nbsp;Some data collected by Unity Analytics or deltaDNA may be used by Unity Ads for personalized advertising.\nsee the FAQs related to advertising for more information.</p>I received an ad from Unity Ads, what do I need to know?<p>Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, and information regarding the delivery of ads and your interaction with them, all of which may be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies.\nFor clarity, Unity collects the following data: whether you click or tap an ad for a new game, whether you watch the ad or play a game frequently, whether others playing a game like the one you\u2019re playing have downloaded a particular new game, and whether you download and install the new game you see advertised.\nWhere a developer has enabled certain featues, Unity Ads may also collect your session information and monetization events.\nAll of this is for purposes of predicting the types of new games that you might like to download.\nUnity may track additional data about you in the future for purposes of making these types of predictions, and we will notify you prior to new data collection.</p>Do I have any choices regarding the data collection described above if I do not wish to see personalized ads?<p>If you are in the EU and do not wish to be targeted in this manner, the first Unity ad you see in an app (as of May 25, 2018) explains how you can opt-out of data collection in that particular game.\nYou can opt-out then or at any time by clicking or tapping the \u201c\u2139\u201d button (or Data Privacy icon) on any ad you see (the \u201c\u2139\u201d button or Data Privacy icon will also allow you to access the data that is collected about you in that particular app).\nFor example, you might see a summary&nbsp.\n&nbsp;that includes information indicating that&nbsp.\nwe see that you are using an iPhone 8 and you are playing from Germany.\nIn the past week we\u2019ve seen you 5 times in this game and have shown you 27 ads.\nYou have installed 0 games based on those ads.</p>\n<p>(Additionally, all users, regardless of their location, may opt-out of all personalized advertising by enabling privacy features on their devices such as Limit Ad Tracking (iOS) and Opt Out of Ads Personalization (Android).\nSee your device\u2019s Help system for more information.)</p>\n<p>Also, you may see certain \u201cbrand\u201d advertising within our ad network (a brand ad is advertising for products that are not games, such as ads for an airline travel deal or a soft drink).\nUnity gets these ads from third-party networks.\nWe do not permit these third parties to add your app usage to their marketing database, except for a few exceptions, which we specifically list in the Advertising Choices section of our Privacy Policy.\nThe small subset of third parties listed are clearly noted as being permitted by our contracts to use the fact that you play a particular game in their future targeting of ads to you for other non-Unity parties.\n&nbsp;The remaining parties listed have been clearly noted as not permitted to maintain data about the ad they served you through the Unity network for future use.&nbsp.\nPlease note that if you have told Unity not to target you or you have exercised choices directly with these third parties as described in our Advertising Choices section, this information will not be maintained or used by us or these third parties.\nPlease note that if you have elected to not have your data collected by Unity, we do not send your advertising identifier to any third party, and you will receive only contextual advertising inside our network.\nYou may also visit the third parties listed in our Privacy Policy (at the links we provide) to see the types of data that these parties have about you based on your device\u2019s advertising identifier.\nPlease review the section \u201cWhat are my privacy choices for advertising?\u201d below to learn more about how to exercise choice with regard to personalized ads.</p>I play a game that uses Unity Multiplayer, what do I need to know?<p>Unity has collected unique device identifiers, IP address (which may be matched to identify approximate location for matchmaking), as well as information regarding games played and match attributes.</p>What are device identifiers (like IDFA or fingerprints) and why do you collect them?<p>Like many other providers of mobile apps, instead of requiring users to create an account and log in to it each time they access one of our apps, Unity and others using our products may opt to recognize the user\u2019s device through various device identifiers.\nDevice identifiers are also used for functions that require Unity to recognize devices across various apps.</p>I use Unity\u2019s game replay service (Everyplay), what do I need to know?<p>A: Unity has sunset this service.</p>\n<p>I sell assets in the Unity Asset Store.\nWhat do I need to know?</p>\n<p>Unity has collected information about your device, including IP address, and your use of the Asset Store as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account.\nOur primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your placement of assets in the store and to ensure that you are paid in accordance with our agreement.\nOther uses might include sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store.\nYou can access and update your account info by logging in to the Asset Store and visiting the Publisher Administration page.\nAlso, when you publish or provide assets for licenses on the Asset Store, your seller name and other information in your Publisher profile will be visible.</p>I bought an asset in the Unity Asset Store.\nWhat should I know?<p>Unity has collected information about your device, including IP address, and your use of the Asset Store as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account.\nOur primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your access to the Asset Store and any assets you have purchased as well as to assure our developers selling assets on the Asset Store that we are effectively providing them due compensation.</p>\n<p>Other uses of this information might include sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store.\nYou can access and update your account info by logging in to the Asset Store and visiting your My Account page.\nYou can also adjust your settings to limit the types of marketing materials we send you or to remove your consent for receiving any advertising from Unity.</p>2.\nPrivacy Policy Overview<p>Unity Technologies and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively \u201cUnity\u201d) offer a variety of products, services, and websites for game Developers and game players that will be referred to in this policy as the \u201cService\u201d or \u201cServices.\u201d
