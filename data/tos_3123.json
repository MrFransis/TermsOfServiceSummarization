of applications, services and content of localsearch (hereinafter the \u00abServices\u00bb) by a customer or a user (hereinafter the \u00abUser\u00bb or \u00abUsers\u00bb), for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the use of the various websites and/or mobile apps of localsearch, e.g.\nlocalsearch.ch, local.ch or search.ch;</li>\n<li>the use of a user account or a customer center (hereinafter the \u00abUser Account\u00bb) of localsearch;</li>\n<li>the use of a booking service from localsearch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By using the Services and/or their functions, the User is deemed to have accepted these Terms and Conditions of Use in their most recent version as amended from time to time.</p>\n<p>This shall be without prejudice to any general terms and conditions of business and any specific provisions regarding the use of a customer center of localsearch accepted by the User in another context (e.g.\nacquisition of products / Services).</p>\n<p>In relation to the use of third-party services integrated or linked to the Services provided by localsearch (\u00abThird-Party Services\u00bb) only the terms and conditions of use of these third parties shall apply (cf.\nin this regard clause 3).</p> 2.\nServices provided by localsearch 2.1.\nGeneral\n<p>localsearch may at any time change, extend or cease providing Services in terms of content or format.</p>\n<p>localsearch may at any time change the product descriptions, offers, prices and similar published by localsearch on the Services, and in the absence of any express agreement(s) to the contrary entered into between localsearch and the User they shall be non-binding.</p>\n<p>localsearch may structure individual Services or the publication of individual content so as to be subject to a fee.\nlocalsearch shall take reasonable efforts to always use up-to-date and accurate data in its Services, although data may contain errors or incomplete information as a result of technical or other incidents.\nThe User shall have no claims against localsearch on the basis of the foregoing.</p>\n<p>localsearch endeavours to ensure a high degree of availability of the Services offered but does not assume any liability for the Services functioning free of any interruptions and faults.\nlocalsearch endeavours to fix any technical faults which lie in its scope of responsibility within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p>The User does not have any right vis-\u00e0-vis localsearch to a use of the Services or any Third-Party Services.</p> 2.2.\nRegistration, User Account\n<p>In order to use the Services, it may be necessary to register and/or create a User Account.\nOnly Users with a legal capacity to act (natural and legal persons) are permitted to register and/or open a User Account.\nUsers shall be obliged to provide complete and accurate details and to make any amendments without delay in the event that details are no longer up-to- date.\nUsers shall be solely responsible for the content of their registration and, as a result, for the information they provide about themselves.\nlocalsearch is not obliged to check these details in terms of accuracy or completeness.</p>\n<p>A log-in to the User Account requires the access data created upon registration (for instance user name/password) or via a third-party platform or identity provider chosen by the User.\nlocalsearch is entitled to regard each access with the correct access data (user name/password) or access authenticated by an identity provider as an authorised access.\nlocalsearch is free \u2013 for legitimate reasons \u2013 to refuse a registration, delete a User Account or restrict access to such account.\nIn this context, any content and information shared via the User Account may remain on display on the Services or third-party platforms.</p>\n<p>localsearch shall determine the type of access protection deployed and shall take measures in order to protect its Services against any unauthorised interference by third parties.\nThere is no absolute protection, however.\nlocalsearch is not obliged, for instance, to take any copy protection measures.</p>\n<p>The User is obliged to treat its access data confidentially and protect it against any misuse.\nThe User shall have no claims against localsearch for any misuse of access data or any loss or damage caused through any improper access of the User Account and use of the Services.\nIf Users detect or assume any misuse or other unlawful offers and content, they shall immediately notify localsearch of such event (customercare@localsearch.ch).</p>\n<p>Users are neither permitted to transfer nor to assign the User Account or rights to the User Account.</p> 2.3.\nPublication of content\n<p>Users may record and amend their own listing as well as any supplementary content such as images, texts, videos, website references, other multimedia content (collectively the \u00abContent\u00bb).\nIn addition, some of the Services allow Users to record, publish and adjust other Content (such as, for instance, comments and reviews) (see clause 4 with regard to the obligations of Users in that context).\nIn this regard, the separate listing terms, which Users accept upon creation of a listing, shall apply.\nWhere Content relates to listings regulated by law, localsearch reserves the right to check Content in accordance with the listing terms and the applicable legal bases (Swiss Telecommunications Act and corresponding ordinances), to correct it and, where appropriate, to refuse amendments made by Users.</p>\n<p>Users are deemed to have agreed to the activation and publication of this Content on the Services, in print media and on partner and third-party platforms and hereby transfer the required rights to localsearch.\nWhere, how and whether this Content is published shall be at the discretion of localsearch.</p>\n<p>Users shall be entitled to adapt any inaccurate or out-of-date Content.\nIn doing so, Users shall be responsible for the timely and technically sound provision of the Content.\nUsers shall bear the risk for the transmission.\nIf it is impossible for Content to be published or if it is published inaccurately because Users have failed to provide the Content in time, or have provided the Content improperly or wrongly, Users shall have no claims vis-\u00e0-vis localsearch.</p>\n<p>localsearch may, at its own discretion and without giving any reasons, refuse, change or delete Content of the User at any time owing to its specific content, its provenance, technical format or quality, in particular if the Content fails to comply with the warranties listed in clause 4.\nUsers shall have no claims against localsearch from the refusal, change or deletion of any Content.</p>\n<p>Content that is published on the Services constitutes subjective opinions of Users and not the views of localsearch.\nNor does the publication constitute confirmation or approval on the part of localsearch regarding the Content shown.\nLocalsearch is not obliged to check any Content and does not assume any liability regarding the accuracy of the Content.</p> 2.4.\nBooking service\n<p>On some of its Services, localsearch offers Users the option of making bookings with localsearch customers (e.g.\nrestaurants, hereinafter the \u00abBusiness\u00bb) via booking systems (online, by email or SMS).\nIn this context, localsearch uses its own booking services as well as third-party booking services (each of them hereinafter a \u00abBooking Service\u00bb).</p>\n<p>As part of this, Users submit their booking enquiry to the respective Booking Service by providing the data requested therein.\nUsers shall provide up-to-date, truthful and complete details in the process.\nAfter these details have been submitted and the respective terms of use have been consented to (e.g.\nregarding cancellations), Users will receive a confirmation (by email, SMS etc.) with regard to their booking enquiry.\nAt the same time, the User\u2018s booking enquiry will be transferred to the Business in question.\nThe Business has the option of confirming or rejecting the booking enquiry or of suggesting an alternative appointment, which will be transmitted back to the User via the Booking Service.\nThe booking in question shall come into effect between the User and the Business.\nIf Users are unable to keep the agreed appointment with the Business, they shall notify the Business without delay.</p>\n<p>With certain booking services, the booking enquiry can go to several Businesses at the same time.\nThe Business that first confirms a booking enquiry enters into the contractual relationship with the User.\nThe Businesses not considered are informed that the booking enquiry has already been processed.\nWith this type of booking enquiries, the cancellation of the booking is neither possible by the User nor by the Business.</p>\n<p>In order to make the User's experience as positive as possible, the Business handles the booking enquiry received from localsearch via the booking service as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>Users are not entitled to use the Booking Service in an improper or disingenuous manner, to interfere with the Booking</p>\n<p>Service or access it in any manner other than via the user interface provided by the Booking Service.</p> 3.\nThird-Party Services\n<p>localsearch may integrate Third-Party Services into its Services.\nIndividual functions of the Services may, for instance, provide for interactions between Users and third parties or their services.\nThird-Party Services may, for instance, allow Users to share Content that is then published on the Third-Party Services.</p>\n<p>It is the sole responsibility of Users as to how they interact with such Third-Party Services.\nlocalsearch is not able to influence how these Third-Party Services and their content are structured.\nUsers shall have no claims vis-\u00e0-vis localsearch from the use of these Third-Party Services.</p>\n<p>For example, the use of Google Maps is subject to the \"Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service\" (https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html) and the \"Google Privacy Policy\" (https://www.google.com/policies/privacy).</p> 4.\nObligations of Users\n<p>Users undertake to use the Services in accordance with their intended purpose and to refrain from any non-intended, improper and unlawful use, e.g.\nthe introduction of malware (such as viruses, worms or other spyware).\nMoreover, the Services must not be used in a way that negatively affects their availability for localsearch or for other Users or that negatively impacts their usage in any other way (e.g.\nthrough the deployment of automatic devices, scripts and robot, spider, crawler or scraper services).</p>\n<p>Users warrant that the Content collected, published or otherwise provided by them in connection with the Services does not breach any legal provisions, third-party rights or public policy.\nIn particular, Users undertake to refrain from publishing any Content that breaches privacy rights, competition laws, confidentiality provisions or any defamatory, racist, violence- promoting, radical, threatening, pejorative, pornographic or obscene Content and to refrain from breaching any third-party rights (such as, for instance, copyrights, trademark rights and rights to company names).\nlocalsearch is entitled to block or delete any Content that breaches these provisions, without delay and without a prior warning, and/or to refrain from publishing such Content.</p> 5.\nIntellectual property\n<p>Users acknowledge that the Services, the Third-Party Services and the Content published by localsearch, third parties or other Users on the Services are usually legally protected and that their use requires consent by the holder of the right in question.</p>\n<p>Any reproduction, transfer (whether electronically or via other means) or modification of the Services or Content, in whole or in part, is not permitted.</p>\n<p>The copying, downloading or printing of the Services or Content is only permitted for personal, not commercial use, provided that no copyright notices or other legally protected designations are removed.</p>\n<p>The full or partial use, or use of extracts, of address lists provided via the Services for purposes of commercial address exploitation, commercial directory enquiry services or as the basis and/or tool for any form of compilation or supplementation of lists of participants, addresses or other lists (electronic, in printed form on data storage devices etc.) as well as the retrieval of the data on the internet for the aforementioned purposes as well as for any other commercial purposes is not permitted.</p>\n<p>The domains \u00ablocal.ch\u00bb, \u00absearch.ch\u00bb and \u00ablocalsearch.ch\u00bb and certain other product or service designations (including logos) are registered trade marks of localsearch.\nThe Users do not have any right of use in relation to these trade marks.\nThe same applies in relation to third-party trade marks, in particular Third-Party Services.</p> 6.\nData protection\n<p>The privacy statement of localsearch as amended from time to time, available on the Service in question and at www.localsearch.ch shall apply.</p>\n<p>Localsearch may provide information regarding other products or services of localsearch to Users (e.g.\nin the form of a newsletter or by letter).\nIf Users no longer wish to receive such messages from localsearch, they may unsubscribe at any time by email to customercare@localsearch.ch, by letter or by telephone using the contact details listed at www.localsearch.ch.</p> 7.\nLiability\n<p>To the extent permissible by law, any liability of localsearch vis-\u00e0-vis Users in connection with the use of the Services is excluded.\nUsers shall note, in particular, that localsearch is not liable for any Content published by other Users on the Services provided by localsearch as well as for content of other websites or mobile apps referred to by the Services.\nLikewise, localsearch is not liable for any Third-Party Services.</p>\n<p>Users undertake to fully indemnify localsearch against all third-party claims that can be attributed to a breach of these Terms and Conditions of Use.</p> 8.\nBreach of the Terms and Conditions of Use\n<p>In the event that these Terms and Conditions of Use are breached, localsearch shall be entitled to block or refuse a User\u2019s access to the Services.</p> 9.\nFinal provisions\n<p>Localsearch reserves the right to amend the Terms and Conditions of Use from time to time.\nThe applicable version shall be the current version as amended from time to time, as is made available at www.localsearch.ch, www.local.ch and www.search.ch.</p>\n<p>Should one or more provisions be void or ineffective, this shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>These Terms and Conditions of Use shall be subject to Swiss law to the exclusion of the conflict of law rules.</p>\n<p>The exclusive legal venue for all disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms and Conditions of Use shall be the registered office of Swisscom Directories AG (Zurich, Switzerland).</p>\n<p>Swisscom

search.ch, \u00f6ffentliches-verzeichnis.ch in print editions of directories, etc.).\nData published using corresponding functions of our Services (e.g., posts, pictures, texts, videos comments, evaluations, etc.) may also be accessible to the public.\nThis applies likewise to the user names used for those purposes We or third parties can also publish published Data on other platforms and in other media (for instance, print media), in adapted form as necessary.\nData that are published via our Services may possibly also be indexed by search machines (such as Google) or processed by third parties on whom we have no influence.\nin this way, such Data may continue to be publicly available in every country on Earth, even after this Data may have been deleted from our system.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data processors</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We can commission third parties to provide specific services (e.g., in the areas of IT, operation of applications, administration printing, shipping, etc.) and to process and store Data (known as \u00abdata processors\u00bb).\nData processors may have access to Personal Data and process them on Our behalf.\nWe obligate the data processors to comply with data protection law and only to process Data in the way that We do it Ourselves.\nData processors that may receive Personal Data may be located in any country, particularly in Switzerland, in EU and EEA countries, and in the US.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contract partners</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We can disclose Data to contract partners (for example, sales partners, service providers, customers, suppliers, financial companies etc.).\nThis occurs, for instance, to fulfil contractual obligations, to offer specific Services, to compare, validate, and update databases (including central address and contact data directories of Ours and of our contract partners), for debt collection and marketing purposes, to analyse the use and operation of our Services, systems, and infrastructure, for payment processing and factoring.\nPossible recipients can also be acquirers or persons interested in acquiring business units, companies, or portions thereof.\nContract partners may receive access to Personal Data and process it for their own purposes (for instance, to perform a contract or to perform their own legal obligations).\nIn this context, they themselves are obligated to comply with applicable data protection laws.\nContract partners that may receive Personal Data may be located in any country, particularly in Switzerland, in EU and EEA countries, and in the US.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disclosure to government agencies and other disclosure on legal grounds</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In certain situations, We may disclose Data to government agencies, official bodies, and other third parties (e.g., in connection with inquiries, investigations, and clarifications from government agencies or official bodies, administrative investigations, criminal investigations, and civil and/or criminal proceedings).\nWe do this in cases where We are called on to do so by government agencies or official bodies, or are obligated according to Our assessment, or where We can assume in good faith that the access to the relevant Data or their use, storage, or disclosure is reasonably necessary in order to enforce applicable terms of use, to discover, prevent, o fight fraud or security flaws, or to protect the rights and property of localsearch.</p>\n<p>If Data that is not otherwise public is transferred to a country without reasonable data protection provisions, We will ensure suitable data protection by deploying adequate contractual guarantees on the basis of EU standard contract clauses, binding corporate rules, or based on the exception of consent, of contract processing, of the determination, assertion or enforcement of legal claims, o overriding public interests, or because the transfer is necessary to protect the physical integrity of a data subject.\nWhere applicable data protection law so provides, You can obtain a copy of the contractual guarantees with regard to Your Personal Data from our Data Protection Office, or You can find out where such a copy can be obtained.\nWe reserve the right to redact such copies for reasons of data protection or for reasons of secrecy.</p> 6.\nRetention period <p>We store Personal Data as long as this is necessary for the purpose for which We have collected them.\nSpecific Personal Data are also subject to legally binding retention obligations of ten or more years, which we comply with.\nWe can also store Personal Data for at least the term of the applicable limitation periods, which in many cases are five or ten years.\nWe generally delete Personal Data that accrue in connection with the use of our Services (e.g., logs, analyses, etc.) and that are not subject to any such retention or limitation periods earlier, as soon as We no longer have any interest in the Processing.\nData can also be retained for a longer period in each case in anonymized form.\nSubject to any express contractual agreement, We are not obligated to You to retain Data for any particular period of time.</p> 7.\nCookies, web analysis and tracking tools, and other technologies <p>We use various common technologies in order to collect, store, and analyse Data when You use Our Services.\nYou will find more details in the Cookie policy of the respective Service.</p> 8.\nSocial media plugins and integration of third-party services <p>We integrate plugins from social networks (e.g., Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter) into our Services.\nThese plugins make it easier to share content on these platforms.</p>\n<p>When visiting Our Services that contain such plugins, a connection to the server of the corresponding provider can be established automatically.\nIn this case, certain Data (such as, for instance, the time of visiting the Service, browser type, IP address) are collected and stored by the provider.\nIf You have a user account at one of these providers, that provider can assign this information to Your profile.\nIf You additionally interact with these plugins (e.g., by clicking on the \u00abLike\u00bb button or by making a comment), this information is also transmitted to this provider, stored there, and possibly published.\nWhen using a social login service (e.g.\nFacebook Connect), the provider can transmit Personal Data to Us, such as name, e-mail address, and profile picture, which are stored at that provider about You.</p>\n<p>In addition, We integrate services from third parties into Our Services, which make it possible for You to interact with customers and other Users of localsearch as well as third parties (as, for example, making a reservation using a booking service or providing evaluations and comments).\nAny provided Data will be forwarded to these third parties for processing and performance of the corresponding service or directly processed by them.</p>\n<p>Please note that the terms of use and data protection provisions of these third parties apply to the data processing by these third parties.</p> 9.\nRights of data subjects <p>Each data subject has a right to access his or her Personal Data.\nIn addition, he or she has the right to require Us to correct, delete and limit Personal Data relating to him or her and to object to such processing of Personal Data.\nExercise of such rights generally presumes that the data subject can unequivocally prove his or her identity.\nIf the processing of personal data is based on consent, the data subject is entitled to revoke his or her consent at any time.\nIn states of the EU or the EEA, the data subject has the right in certain cases to receive the Data generated during the use of online services in a structured, commonly used and machine- readable format that permits further use and transmission.</p>\n<p>Please click <strong>here</strong> to exercise your rights.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to restrict the rights of the data subject within the limits laid down by the law from time to time in force, for instance, to only provide limited information or to refrain from deleting Data.\nIn addition, please note that deletion of Your Personal Data may mean that Services may no longer be available or cannot be used in whole or in part.</p>\n<p>If We automatically make a decision affecting an individual that has legal effects vis-\u00e0-vis the data subject or considerably impairs this person in a similar way, the data subject can speak with a responsible person at Our offices and demand recon sideration of the decision from that person, or demand an evaluation by a person from the start, insofar as applicable law permits such an action.\nIn this case, the data subject may in some circumstances no longer be able to use certain automated services.\nThe person will be informed of such decisions separately.</p>\n<p>Each data subject has the right to make a complaint to the responsible data protection authority.\nIf the data controller is based in Switzerland, the relevant authority is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (www.edoeb.admin.ch).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web search</li>\n<li>Apps</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>About search.ch</li>\n<li>Jobs at search.ch</li>\n<li>Terms and
