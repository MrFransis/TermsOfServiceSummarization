before using sCloud.\nYou're not allowed to copy, or modify sCloud, any part of sCloud, or our trademarks in any way.\nYou're not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of sCloud, and you also

recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.\nIt could make
