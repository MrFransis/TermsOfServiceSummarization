In fact, one of the primary purposes of blockerDNS is to increase privacy while browsing the internet.\nThis is an honest one-man operation run by me, Tambe Barsbay.\nMy family uses blockerDNS, my friends use it, and I myself use it.\nThis privacy policy was written by me, and not a team of lawyers.\nI've tried to keep it as simple and easy to understand as possible but if you have any questions please email support@blockerdns.com.\n<br>Unless otherwise stated, all the policies and explanations apply to a default account that has not opted into additional data logging/collection.\nIn other words, the lack of logging and data collection as explained below is the default for all new and existing users.\nHowever, features like the data analytics dashboard, by their nature, require user data to be logged.\nSo for those users that would like to take advantage of these additional tools, the option to explicitly opt-in and turn on logging is offered.\nThe relevant privacy information for those that have opted into logging is listed in a separate section below.\n<br>\n<b>Abbreviations</b>\n<br>DoT: DNS over TLS<br>DoH: DNS over HTTPS<br>Do53: Standard

Information we collect To sign up for our service, users must register with an email address and password, which is the extent of personal data we store.\nFor users that sign in with their Google

we store is the user's email address.\nThe email address is associated with a randomly generated string of letters that we prepend to \".blockerdns.com\" to serve as their unique, personal URL that is used to access our service.\nAdditionally, we will use this email address to contact the user regarding their service with blockerDNS.\nWe may also use the email address to request feedback about the quality of our service from users.\nUser emails will never be sold or otherwise provided to any third-party and will never be used for marketing.<br>\n<br>We do not log DNS requests, regardless of the

monitor the traffic to our web site.\nGoogle Analytics is unable to track users of our service, as we block them.\nBut visitors to our web site that are not users may read Google's privacy information here.<br>\n<br>\n<br>Sharing of information blockerDNS is not some huge corporation with \"affiliates\" or \"marketing partners\" that get to see all your private data.\nThis is a small web business run by one person.\nAnd as mentioned above, user emails, the only private data we store, will never be sold or otherwise provided to any third-party.<br>\n<br>\n<br>Security It goes without saying that security is taken very seriously.\nWe know that this what everyone says, but please read on.<br>\n<br>If you sign in to blockerDNS with your Google account, we only access and store your email address.\nAs a result, we aren't able to lose your personal private data since we don't have any of it.<br>\n<br>If you signed up for blockerDNS with a direct registration with us, we do have one private piece of your data stored, which of course is your appropriately salted and hashed password.\n(If you enable 2-Step login, we also store that information as well.)<br>\n<br>\n<br>Your choices As an active user there is no data that a user can request to be deleted, since we don't store any personal data on our end.\nThe closest thing to private data we store is the user's email, which is needed as a basic identifier so we can provide our service.\nFor premium (paid) users only, a minimal amount of private data is stored with our payment processor, Stripe.\nThe data that is stored is that which was provided by the user at checkout/sign-up.\nThis typically includes email, name, billing address and credit card.\nWe typically also append the IP address that a user signed up from (for possible future fraud prevention or mitigation purposes) to the Stripe data.\nActive users generally cannot have this data deleted since it is needed to maintain a subscription.\n(However, if a user insists on having no data with Stripe, we can likely work out a personal solution where, say, they prepay for a certain period of service, and once the payment is processed we can then remove all data from Stripe.\nOr we can come to an agreement on another form of payment, etc.) Inactive users can request that we remove their data from Stripe.\nRemovable data would include credit card information and any stored billing address.\nOn the blockerDNS side, inactive users additionally can request that we delete their email address from our database since they are no longer using our service by emailing us at support@blockerdns.com.\nHowever, it should be noted that the email address used to submit the request, along with the email address to be deleted as noted in the email body\u2014if it is different, will remain archived in our email storage as with all emails.\nOur email is hosted with Google's G Suite service.<br>\n<br>As a non-user, you may opt out of Google Analytics data collection by using a browser extension provided by Google.\nAs a user of our service this is unnecessary as we block Google Analytics as part of our ad and tracker blocking.\n<b>It should be noted that anything regarding Google Analytics only applies to website traffic and not to the actual blockerDNS service for which no tracking or analytics happens.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Cookies Please be aware that cookies are only relevant to our website, and not the actual blockerDNS service.\nOur service itself is customizable DNS which doesn't set, or have anything to do with, cookies.<br>\n<br>blockerDNS offers two methods for registration and sign-up.\nThe first, signing in with Google, is offered for convenience.\nWith this method, users don't need a new sign in and password for our service, we don't need to store their password and so we don't have any private data to even lose because security is outsourced to Google.\nHowever, for more privacy conscious users that prefer to avoid Google altogether, we also offer the option of signing up directly and securely with blockerDNS.<br>\n<br>blockerDNS sets up to three cookies for the sole purpose of maintaining your sign-in state.\nAdditionally, cookies are set by Google Sign-In, Google Analytics and Stripe.\nGoogle's overall privacy policy can be accessed here.\nPrivacy information relating to Google Analytics is available here.\nAnd Stripe's privacy policy can be found here.\nAs mentioned above, this only applies to our website and has nothing to do with our service itself.\nYou can sign up for our service, or sign in to our website to edit account settings, and then clear any and all cookies if you prefer since they aren't in any way related to actually using blockerDNS.<br>\n<br>\n<br>Information for users with logging enabled If, and only if, you have enabled logging for your account, data on your DNS requests (essentially your internet browsing history) will be saved.\nSpecifically, every DNS request will be saved with your username, a timestamp, the source IP address, the protocol used (i.e., DoT, DoH, etc.), the domain requested and the result of the request (i.e., allowed, blocked, blacklist, etc.).<br>\n<br>This data is used in the data analytics dashboard only.\nIt is not sold or otherwise provided to third-parties or monetized in any way.<br>\n<br>You have full control of your data.\nLogging can be disabled at any time, you can download a copy of your data at any time (i.e., if you want to analyze it your own way offline), you can limit how far back your logs go by enabling auto deletion of older data, and you can delete all of your stored data at any time.\nGo to your account settings to manage your data.<br>\n<br>\n<br>Browser extension For users of the blockerDNS extension for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Firefox, the only information we have is that which is provided to us by the respective add-on/extension store (i.e., number of extension downloads, etc.).\nWe collect absolutely no information while the extension is being used.\nAll of the filtering/ad blocking is done locally by the extension.\nThat is to say, the extension does not \"phone home\" with your data or send any requests back to us.\nWe don't even collect the kind of legitimate information lots of other developers do that lets them see how you use their product so they can figure out where things need improving.<br>\n<br>That said, the extension does occasionally talk to the blockerDNS servers for one sole purpose, though, and that is to check if there is an updated version of the ad and tracker block list.\nWhen the extension is first installed it comes with a built-in list, and we originally planned on putting out a new version of the extension through the Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Firefox web stores with a fresh built-in list each time we updated it.\nBut the add-on/extension store review processes for new extension versions take a few days.\nAnd since we prefer users to have the latest block lists as soon as possible, we added the ability for the extension to check for updated lists.\nThe request it makes to our server does not include any user information whatsoever.\nNo authentication, no id number, nothing.<br>\n<br>\n<br>Contacting us If you have any questions
