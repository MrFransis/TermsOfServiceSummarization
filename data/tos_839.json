Policy <p>\n<em>Last updated on&nbsp;July, 17, 2020</em>\n</p>\n<p>On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice for the European Union (EU) issued a significant ruling in a case examining transfers of data from the EU.\nThis ruling invalidated the EU/United States (US) Privacy Shield framework.&nbsp;We understand that some of our customers may have questions about the impact of this ruling.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>As an Interfolio customer, you can continue to use the Interfolio Software as a Service in compliance with European law.\nThe Court\u2019s ruling does not change your ability to transfer data today between the EU and US.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We have provided customers with overlapping protections under both the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) and Privacy Shield frameworks for data transfers from the EU.&nbsp;Although the July 16 ruling invalidated the use of Privacy Shield moving forward, the SCCs remain valid.&nbsp;Our customers are protected under SCCs and under GDPR.&nbsp;The ruling does not change data flows for our Customers.\nWe will continue to transfer data in compliance with today\u2019s ruling and further guidance from EU data protection authorities.</p>\n<p>We routinely work to advance our protections for customers based on developments like these.&nbsp;Interfolio embraced Privacy Shield as a successor to Safe Harbor after that framework was invalidated, and we have extended GDPR rights to our worldwide customer base.&nbsp;Privacy is ever evolving.\nOur customers can be assured that we are committed to ensuring their data will continue to flow securely through our services in full compliance with all applicable GDPR guidelines and that we\u2019ll work collaboratively with all involved parties as new approaches to EU/US data protection are considered and finalized.\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to us at&nbsp;privacy@interfolio.com.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Interfolio complies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union to the United States.&nbsp.\nYou may view our Privacy Shield Notice here.&nbsp.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall take precedence.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, the Privacy Shield Principles, and to view our certification, please visit www.privacyshield.gov.\nInterfolio is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>\n<p>If the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) applies to your information, we provide this privacy policy so you can exercise your rights to receive information about our data practices, as well as to request access to and deletion of your information.\n&nbsp;You may request to review, update and delete your information, as well as export and download a copy of it.</p>\n<p>Interfolio&nbsp;processes your information&nbsp;for the purposes described in this policy, which include \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d under the CCPA.</p>\n<p>Cookie Information.\nInterfolio uses cookies and similar technologies in our Services and on our Website to help us collect information.\nFor more details about how we use these technologies, and your opt-out opportunities and other options, please see our Cookie Policy.</p> Interfolio\u2019s Privacy Policy <p>Welcome to www.interfolio.com (the \u201cSite\u201d), a website owned and operated by Interfolio, Inc.\n(\u201cInterfolio,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d).\nWe developed this privacy policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) to explain how we collect, protect, use, and disclose information from you, our user (\u201cyou\u201d or\u201cyour\u201d).\nInterfolio, Inc.\noffers services to both individuals and institutions.\nIf you are using any of the Services through an educational or other institution that is a customer of Interfolio, this policy does not supersede the terms of any agreements between Interfolio and any other party, nor does it affect the terms of any agreement between any user of the Services, their educational institution or any third party.\nPlease make sure that you read the terms of any privacy policies that you enter into with parties other than Interfolio, including your educational institution, as those policies may also explain how your personal information is used by them.\nPlease review the following statement to understand how the information you provide to Interfolio through the services will be treated.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy will apply to users of the Site regardless of the type of User you are.\nYou may be any of the following types of Users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cVisitor\u201d, which means that you simply browse the Site;</li>\n<li>\u201cApplicant\u201d or \u201cCandidate\u201d which means you have registered with us and established an Account.\nApplicants/Candidates may be students, employees or faculty members of a University or may join Interfolio without such affiliation;</li>\n<li>\u201cRecommender\u201d, which means that you have been asked to submit a letter of recommendation for an Applicant;</li>\n<li>\u201cUniversity User\u201d, which means you are an employee, contractor or agent of a University operating in such capacity.\nA \u201cUniversity\u201d is a college or university with whom Interfolio has a contractual relationship, generally with the career services department or a specific academic department, to provide services to students, employees and faculty members.\nand</li>\n<li>\u201cRecipient User\u201d, which means an employee, contractor or agent of a college, university or other employer that uses the Service to locate potential employees and/or faculty members (\u201cRecipient\u201d).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase \u201cPersonal Information\u201d, we mean contact information (i.e., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and information associated with the foregoing.\nWhen we use the phrase \u201cAnonymous Information\u201d, we mean information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information.\nAnonymous Information does not enable identification of or contact with, individual persons.</p>\n<p>BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p> How We Collect Information <p>\n<em>Personal Information</em>\n<br>We receive and store information you voluntarily provide to us (either through the Site or in some other way) upon registration or your use of the Site and Services.\nWhen you register with us, regardless of the type of User you are, we require you to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name and email address.\nYou may choose to provide additional Personal Information as part of certain Services.\nAs a rule, Interfolio only collects information necessary to provide the Services you or your institution have requested.</p>\n<p>Some of our Services are designed for job Applicants, in which case the following provisions apply.\nPlease remember that you do not have to submit any of this additional information, but we may not be able to provide you certain Services without that information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there are fees associated with the Services you receive, we will collect certain Personal Information in order to process payment of such fees, including a credit card number and associated billing information, and charge and collect the fees.\nWe refer to this information as \u201cBilling Information\u201d.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we will only use this Billing Information to process and collect fees.\nWe may store this Billing Information if you request us to do so.\nSome Universities cover the fees for their students to use certain of our Services.</li>\n<li>If you are an Applicant creating a dossier on the Site for our document transmission services (a \u201cDossier\u201d), we enable you to submit information relevant to your Dossier, including your contact information, information about your experience, education, and interests.\nWe will also collect and manage documents associated with your Dossier, such as your writing samples, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and cover letters.</li>\n<li>If you are an Applicant creating your portfolio on the Site to publish on our Site (\u201cPortfolio\u201d), in addition to the information we may collect for your Dossier, we may collect additional information about your work history, publications, experience and other information you voluntarily submit to us, whether through the Site or otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Disclosure\u2014Information Collected from Third Parties.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Certain Personal Information may be provided about you by other Users.\nFor example, if you are a University User, someone within your University will have registered you and granted you access to our Services.\nIf you are a Recommender, an Applicant may provide us your name and email address.\nWe will consider any Personal Information about you collected as part of the registration process to be your Personal Information.</p>\n<p>Other Users may also submit confidential Personal Information about you, including as part of your Dossier.\nFor example, a letter of recommendation, evaluation or committee packet for your Dossier may be provided to us by a Recommender or by your University.\nWe will refer to this type of Personal Information as \u201cConfidential Personal Information\u201d in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you are the User providing the Confidential Personal Information, you recognize that the User about whom such information pertains will be the party controlling that information, even though it may contain information about you and is designed to be confidential.\nFor example, if you are a Recommender, you will no longer be able to control or edit a letter of recommendation after you submit it to the Services, except that you can request that it no longer be used on behalf of the Applicant.\nRather, the Applicant will control the Recipients to whom the letter is disclosed, although it is associated with your name as Recommender, and it will not be considered your Personal Information.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, an Applicant will not be able to see Confidential Personal Information about him or her but will be able to direct the disclosure to certain Recipients.\nThe provider of Confidential Personal Information cannot see the manner in which it is disclosed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Anonymous Information</em>\n<br>As you use our Service, we may also collect certain information, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and access times.\nWe use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to gather information regarding the date and time of your use of the Service.\nAn \u201cInternet protocol address\u201d or \u201cIP address\u201d is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet access provider when you use the Internet.\nIn some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session.\nbut if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session.\nWe track IP addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our web page flow.\n\u201cCookies\u201d are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer\u2019s hard drive while you are viewing a web site.\nWe may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).\nPersistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Disclosure\u2014Usage of Third Party Cookies</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may use a third party tracking service (such as Google Analytics) to track and analyze Anonymous Information from Users of our Site.\nSuch third parties may use Cookies to help track User behavior.\nWe do not have access or control over these cookies.\nOur analytics service provider uses session IDs to help us uncover bugs, improve user pathways, and build better services.</p> How We Use Information <p>\n<em>Personal Information</em>\n<br>As we mentioned above, we use Personal Information to: (a) assist you in managing the documents in your Dossier and Portfolio, (b) provide you an online location for your academic portfolio (if you so choose).\n(c) facilitate Applicants applying to Recipients.\nand (d) otherwise connect Applicants to Recipients.\nAs a result, we use your Personal Information to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Administer your Account;</li>\n<li>Provide you with Services and customer support;</li>\n<li>Tailor the features of the Site or Services to you;</li>\n<li>Respond to your requests, resolve disputes and/or troubleshoot problems;</li>\n<li>Verify your compliance with your obligations in our Terms of Use and/or other agreements you may have executed with us.\nand</li>\n<li>Communicate with you about the Site and the Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sensitive information such as social security numbers are also collected for identity verification, but may be disclosed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We may also use your Personal Information to create Anonymous Information records by excluding information that makes the information personally identifiable to you, any other individual and the applicable University or Recipient.</p>\n<p>We may send you communications via email about the Site and Services.\nYou can opt out of receiving certain communications from the Site by clicking the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link at the bottom of each email.\nPlease note that even if you unsubscribe or opt-out, we may still send you Site and Service related communications (e.g., emails related to your account).</p>\n<p>\n<em>Anonymous Information</em>\n</p>\n<p>Generally, we use Anonymous Information in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of our Services.\nWe may, through our use of Cookies, keep you logged into the Site, personalize your use of the Site and customize your experience on the Site.\nWe may also use your Anonymous Information to improve our internal operations, surveys and software, customize the content and layout of the Site and/or Service and notify you of updates to our Site and Services.</p> Disclosure of Information <p>If you are an Applicant, you are probably using our Services to help you either send components of your Dossier to Recipients or to manage your online Portfolio.\nEither way, our Services operate on the principle of a submission event.\nOur Services are designed to manage your distribution of certain Personal Information to selected Recipients (or, in some cases, on our Site).\nAs an Applicant, we may (and you hereby authorize us to) disclose the Personal Information selected by you to Recipients designated by you.\nTo be clear, if you tell us to send your Dossier to ABC University, we will consider it an authorization to disclose your Dossier to that university (and you agree that it will constitute an authorization).\nAdditionally, if you maintain a Portfolio, you authorize us to disclose the Personal Information selected by you in the manner designated by you on our Site (whether publicly or privately).</p>\n<p>We may disclose certain Personal Information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To third-party services to manage communications (e.g., in order to send transactional emails related to our services).\nWe also use third-party analytics services to help understand your usage of our services.\nIn particular, we provide a limited amount of your information (such as your name and email address) to third-party service providers in order to analyze your use of our website and/or product and track our relationship so that we can improve our service to you.\nIn such cases, we will require such vendors agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy (including your Billing Information to our payment processor).</li>\n<li>To third parties to whom you ask or authorize us to send Personal Information (including, if applicable, Recipients and/or your University);</li>\n<li>To a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, \u201cAffiliates\u201d), in the event we have such Affiliates in the future, in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy;</li>\n<li>If we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) resolve disputes, investigate problems, or enforce our Terms of Use.\n(b) comply with relevant laws or to respond to requests from law enforcement or other government officials relating to investigations or alleged illegal activity, in which case we can (and you authorize us to) disclose Personal Information without subpoenas or warrants served on us.\nor (c) protect and defend our rights or property or the rights and property of you or third parties.\nNote that we may be compelled to reveal personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event of a change in ownership, or a merger with, acquisition by, or transfer (including by bankruptcy) or sale of assets to, another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of your Personal Information to that entity.\nWe will notify you (via a posting on a Site or email, in our discretion) of such a transfer.\nThis means if you are concerned about your Personal Information being transferred to a new owner, you can deactivate your Account.\nWe will require the acquiring entity to comply with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>In the event we offer public or private forums on the Site or Services, you are welcome to share as much Personal Information as you think is necessary and appropriate (or authorize us to share such information).\nBut please be aware than any Personal Information will be made available to other Registered Users and/or generally on our Site and we do not control what third parties do with such information.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Disclosure to Universities or Recipients</em>\n</p>\n<p>Giving you tools to help you protect your Personal Information is a vital part of our mission.\nIt is up to you to make sure you are comfortable with the information you provide.\nWe do provide Personal Information to Recipients to whom you have authorized disclosure and, if applicable, your University.\nWe do not control how Universities or Recipients (or their respective Users) use or disclose the information they obtain from us.</p>\n<p>If you are affiliated with a University, you hereby authorize us, and we may disclose your Dossier, related Personal Information and your Dossier\u2019s delivery history to your University and its University Users, unless you opt-out of such disclosure in your account settings.\nIf you do not wish to share this information with your University, you can opt-out by logging into your account and changing your privacy settings.</p>\n<p>IF YOU AUTHORIZE US TO SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH A RECIPIENT OR YOUR UNIVERSITY, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER HOW ANY SUCH RECIPIENT OR UNIVERSITY USES AND DISCLOSES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE DIRECTLY TO THAT RECIPIENT.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (1) INTERFOLIO DOES NOT EVALUATE ANY RECIPIENT\u2019S OR UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRIVACY PRACTICES, AND (2) INTERFOLIO WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY ACTIONS OF ANY RECIPIENT OR UNIVERSITY.\nYOU SHOULD KNOW THAT RECIPIENTS TO WHOM WE MAY DISCLOSE YOUR DISCLOSED PROFILE MAY SHARE YOUR DISCLOSED PROFILE WITH OTHERS.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Accountability for Onward Transfer \u2013 EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p>As described in the Privacy Shield Principles, Interfolio is accountable for personal data that it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfers to third parties.\nIf third parties that process personal data on our behalf do so in a manner that does not comply with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are accountable, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p> Accessing and Controlling your Information <p>We acknowledge the individual\u2019s right to access their personal data.\nTo change information

any inaccuracies in any Personal Information that we have in our possession once notified of the requested change.\nWe endeavor to process these requested changes as soon as is possible, but it may

recommendation).\nSimilarly, if you have provided us with Confidential Personal Information, you may not be able to control this information or to whom it is disclosed.\nHowever, you can request its deletion by emailing privacy@interfolio.com or by calling (877) 997-8807.\nSuch a request will not affect any previously disclosed information.</p>\n<p>Certain information is necessary in order for us

Service <p>Welcome to <b>www.interfolio.com</b> (the <b>\u201cSite\u201d</b>), a website owned and operated by Interfolio, Inc.\n(<b>\u201cInterfolio,\u201d</b>\n<b>\u201cus,\u201d</b> &nbsp;<b>\u201cwe\u201d </b>or<b> \u201cour\u201d</b>).\nWe offer a platform to support faculty and institutions with the nuanced, complex challenges around academic hiring, review, tenure, and promotion, as well as faculty activity reporting.\n.\n&nbsp;We take the information you provide us and offer a number of related services (<b>\u201cServices\u201d</b>).\n&nbsp;By using this Site and our Services you agree to these Terms of Use (and are referred to herein as \u201c<b>you</b>\u201d and \u201c<b>your</b>\u201d).\n&nbsp;If you do not wish to agree to the Terms of Use you are not authorized to access this Site or to use the Services and must cease using this Site and the Services immediately.</p>\n<p>The following terms and conditions (the <b>\u201cTerms of Use\u201d</b>) form a binding agreement between you and us.\nPlease review the following terms carefully.\nEach time you access the Site or use the Services, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms, regardless of the type of User you are (defined in Section 1 below).\n&nbsp;If you are an Account Administrator or Recipient User, you: (i) represent that you have the authority to enter into these Terms of Use on behalf of the Institutional Customer or Recipient on whose behalf you use the Services and (ii) agree that the terms \u201c<b>you</b>\u201d and \u201c<b>your</b>\u201d in these Terms of Use refer to the Institutional Customer or Recipient \u2014as well as to you personally.\nprovided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, a Recipient or an Institutional Customer may also enter into a separate agreement with Interfolio regarding use of certain Services that specifically provides that such separate agreement, and not these Terms of Use, will apply to the Recipient.\n&nbsp;In that case these Terms of Use will apply to you alone.\n&nbsp;If you are not permitted by law or otherwise to make the foregoing representation or warranty, you must notify us in writing prior to using the Site and Services and you must cease access to the Site and Services as an Account Administrator or Recipient User immediately.\n&nbsp;In addition, certain areas of the Site or Services may be subject to additional terms of use separately agreed to or otherwise posted within, adjacent to or linked to from such areas.\nAny such terms are incorporated into these Terms of Use unless otherwise set forth therein.</p>\n<p>We may at our sole discretion change, add, or delete portions of these Terms of Use at any time.\nWe will notify you of any material changes by posting notice of the changes on the Site, and/or, in our sole discretion, by email.\n&nbsp;Changes to these Terms of Use, which may be made in our sole and exclusive discretion, will be effective upon acceptance of these Terms of Use for new subscriptions and effective for all existing Users thirty (30) calendar days after the posting of the new Terms of Use on the Site except those Candidates that directly paid an annual fee for use of the Services (excluding any Candidate that received a free account that was paid for indirectly by a Recipient), in which case such new Terms of Use shall not apply until the renewal, if any, of your account at the end of its then-current term.\n&nbsp;It is your responsibility to check these Terms of Use for changes prior to use of the Site, and in any event your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these Terms of Use constitutes your acceptance of any changes.\n&nbsp;You may reject any changes to the Terms of Use by ceasing all use of the Site and the Services.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b> OUR ECOSYSTEM.</b> We have designed our Services to meet the needs of various types of users of our Site and/or our Services (collective, the \u201c<b>Users</b>\u201d).\nYou may be any one or more of the following types of Users, depending on how you are using the Services at any particular time:</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>\n<i>Visitor</i>\n</b>.\nA Visitor may browse the Site in accordance with these Terms of Use, but will not have access to our core Services without being a Registered User.</li>\n<li>\n<b>\n<i>Candidate</i>\n</b>.\nA Candidate is a student, employee, faculty member, job applicant or other person who wish to manage their academic and professional credentials for their own benefit through our Services.\n&nbsp;As a Candidate you may receive your account through an association with an Institutional Customer or you may join Interfolio without such affiliation.\n&nbsp;Some of our Services designed for Candidates include the management of dossiers for our document transmission services (<b>\u201cDossiers\u201d</b>).\nDossiers may include among other things writing samples, transcripts, cover letters and letters of recommendations.\nPortfolios and Dossiers are explained in more detail below.</li>\n<li>\n<b>\n<i>Recommender</i>\n</b>\n<i>.</i> We refer to an individual who has been asked to submit a letter of recommendation for a Candidate as a Recommender.\n&nbsp;Recommenders utilize our Services by submitting letters of recommendation with our document management tags to us, via either: (i) postal mail.\nor (ii) via our portal by creating an account on our Site.\nRecommenders do not have to register to use our Service and may never log onto our Site if they elect to mail recommendations.</li>\n<li>\n<b>\n<i>Account Administrator</i>\n</b>\n<i>.</i> An Account Administrator is a person assigned by an Institutional Customer or Recipient who manages the access for his or her Institutional Customer and authorizes other Account Administrators, as well as in certain cases assigns and manages accounts of Candidates associated with such Institutional Customer.</li>\n<li>\n<b>\n<i>Institutional Customer.</i>\n</b> &nbsp;An Institutional Customer is an entity (generally but not always a college or university) for whom Interfolio has agreed to provide Services to such entity as well as to Candidates associated with, or seeking to be associated with, such entity, which Services are managed by an Account Administrator.</li>\n<li>\n<b>\n<i>Recipient</i>\n</b>.\n&nbsp;A Recipient is an entity (generally but not always a college or university) that uses our Services to evaluate Dossiers and/or Portfolios and find potential employees or other persons to be otherwise associated with such entity.\n&nbsp;An Institutional Customer may also be a Recipient as well when using our Services to evaluate Dossiers and/or Portfolios and find potential employees or other persons to be otherwise associated with such entity.</li>\n<li>\n<b>\n<i>Recipient User</i>\n</b>\n<i>.</i> A Recipient User is personnel of a Recipient that uses the Services on behalf of a Recipient to receive and/or evaluate Dossiers and/or Portfolios and find potential employees for or other persons to be associated with the Recipient.\nand/or its affiliated entities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We refer to all Users other than Visitors and Recommenders who submit recommendations solely through postal mail as <b>\u201cRegistered Users\u201d</b>.\nTo become a Registered User, you must provide your name and email address (either directly to us, or we may receive it from an Institutional Customer) and select a password (your email address and password, collectively your <b>\u201cLog-In Credentials\u201d</b>).\nYou may not transfer or share your Log-In Credentials with any third parties, and you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Log-In Credentials.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we rely on Log-In Credentials to know whether Registered Users accessing the Site and using our Services are authorized to do so.\nIf someone accesses our Site or Services using your Log-In Credentials, you authorize us to rely on the Log-In Credentials and to assume that it is you who is accessing the Site and Services.\n&nbsp;You are solely responsible for any and all use of your Log-In Credentials and all activities that occur under or in connection with your Log-In Credentials or account.\nYou agree to be responsible for any act or omission on the Site or Services conducted under your Log-In Credentials.\n&nbsp;You agree not to register for an account on behalf of an individual other than yourself, or register for an account on behalf of any group or entity (except if you are an Account Administrator, in which case you may register for another person to the extent permitted within the Services but you agree to never use the Log-In Credentials of another person).\n&nbsp;You represent to us that all information in your account profile and the associated Dossiers and Portfolios is true, accurate, current and complete, and you agree to maintain and promptly update such information to keep it true, accurate, current and complete prior to each use of the Services.\nIf we have a reasonable belief or suspicion that such information is not true, accurate, current, or complete, we may deny or terminate your access to the Site or Services (or any portion thereof).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b> MANAGING DOSSIERS.</b>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<i>Dossiers.</i> Candidates use our Services to help manage their academic information and other documents, including transcripts, letters of recommendation, and cover letters.\nDossiers may include Confidential Personal Information submitted by other Registered Users about a Candidate.\n&nbsp;Candidates can have Recommenders submit their letter of recommendation directly to us and we store them in the Candidate\u2019s Dossier.\n&nbsp;We understand the sensitive nature of this Confidential Personal Information.\n&nbsp;In accordance with our Privacy Policy, Recommenders will not have the ability to revise information they have submitted about Candidates after such submission, but a Recommender can request that it no longer be used on behalf of the applicable Candidate.\n&nbsp;Candidates will not be able to review a confidential recommendation directly from the Service that a Recommender has submitted unless the Recommender elects to permit it or disclosure is required by a governmental authority.\n&nbsp;You hereby authorize us to make Dossiers available to the Account Administrators associated with you as a Candidate (e.g.\nthe Harvard University Career Center will be able to see Harvard Student Dossiers) of the Candidate unless you opt out of such sharing through the Service.\n&nbsp;A Dossier is a secondary source of document storage.\n&nbsp;While we endeavor to employ industry standard systems to avoid any data loss, as between you and us it is your responsibility to ensure you have backup copies of all of the documents and information available through your Dossier.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Transmission of Dossiers.</i> At the Candidate\u2019s request, and subject to Candidate\u2019s payment of any applicable fees, we will use reasonable efforts to transmit the Dossier or certain components thereof to Recipients selected by the Candidate.\nThis transmission may be electronic or via courier or postal mail, based on the method selected by the Candidate and/or Recipient.\nWe will provide you with tools to track and confirm delivery as reported by the applicable carrier.\n&nbsp;You hereby authorize us to disclose your Dossier to any Recipient selected using your Log-in Credentials.\n&nbsp;We do not control how any Recipients use the Dossier and have no responsibility for the copy of the Dossier after our transmission to a Recipient.\n&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to decline to transmit the Dossier to a specific Recipient, including if we believe such transmission would violate these Terms of Use or any applicable laws, in which case we will use reasonable efforts to promptly notify you of our decision.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Portfolios.</i> Our Portfolio service allows you as a Candidate to create a website on the Service touting your achievements.\nYou as a Candidate can put whatever you wish on your public, online Portfolio, including the same information as Dossiers.\nprovided, however, that you will not be able to include Confidential Personal Information (as defined in our Privacy Policy that is a part of these Terms of Use) submitted by Registered Users other than Candidates (e.g., letters of recommendation) on your Portfolio.\n&nbsp;Details of how Confidential Personal Information is used and disclosed is set forth in our Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Upload.</i> As described below, you will be able to upload certain information related to your Dossier to our Site and Services.\nSubject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, we will take commercially reasonable efforts to store and retain a copy of your Dossier and Portfolio to a server operated by Interfolio or our agents.\nYou agree to upload your Portfolios and Dossier in compliance with our documentation for the Services.\nYou hereby grant us a license to use, reproduce, access, view, modify and reformat without making any editorial changes to content, translate and distribute your Dossier and Portfolios, solely and to the limited extent necessary to perform our obligations hereunder and provide you the Services.\nThis includes the right to distribute access to view your Dossier and Portfolios through the Services.\n&nbsp;As between you and us, and without implying any transfer of ownership in third party materials such as letters of recommendation that are owned by their respective authors, you own all of your Dossier and Portfolio and are solely responsible for their content, as well as any of the content contained in your communications with other Registered Users.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Access.</i> We will take reasonable efforts to restrict access to the Dossiers to Registered Users using their applicable Log-In Credentials who are authorized to view such information.\n&nbsp;However, no password-protected system of data storage and retrieval can be made entirely impenetrable and you acknowledge that our Site and the Services are not invulnerable to all security breaches or immune from errors, viruses, security threats or other vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Review.</i> We do not ordinarily review, inspect, edit or monitor any Dossiers or components thereof, except as set otherwise provided herein (including the section titled \u201cVerification\u201d below).\nIf we believe that a Dossier is being used for storage and distribution of any illegal material such as copyrighted content, we reserve the right to examine the content of the Dossier.\nWe reserve the right to refuse, remove or disable access to any Dossier stored on our servers for any reason we deem necessary to protect the Services from disruption, reputational harm, or us from liability, or other reasons we deem reasonable, including that the Dossier or their storage is illegal or may violate these Terms of Use.\nWE TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTENT OF ANY COMPONENT OF YOUR DOSSIER SUBMITTED ABOUT YOU BY SOMEONE ELSE, INCLUDING ANY CONFIDENTIAL PERSONAL INFORMATION THEREIN.\n&nbsp;YOU AGREE THAT IF YOU FEEL YOU HAVE ANY CLAIM WITH RESPECT TO SUCH CONTENT, YOU WILL TAKE UP SUCH CLAIM, AS BETWEEN US AND SUCH OTHER PERSON, SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH OTHER PERSON.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Verification.</i> We may, but are not obligated to, review individual confidential documents that comprise Dossiers as is reasonably necessary to provide the Services, including to ensure their placement in the correct Dossier, the quality of the file itself (e.g., it was scanned clearly) and that they are current (i.e., an old version from ten years ago was not mistakenly sent), or in connection with any claim of a criminal, fraudulent or similar act.\nWe do not review the documents to evaluate the quality of the content contained in them.\nThough we use commercially reasonable efforts when we chose to provide these verification Services, we cannot and do not guarantee the results of our verification services.\nWe do not make any representations or warranties about the effectiveness of those Services.\nAs between you and us, it is your responsibility as a User to provide any and all verification and quality control for any non-confidential documents that you have submitted to the Dossier.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b> FEES.</b> We may charge fees for Candidates to use and maintain Dossiers.\nAs a Candidate, you agree to pay our then-current and applicable fees for Services where such fees are identified to you in advance of using the Service.\nYour use of certain Services may be limited to the restrictions established in your applicable plan (e.g., limitations on storage amounts).\nInterfolio charges and collects in advance for use of certain Services.\nSome Institutional Customers cover certain fees incurred by their students using certain Services as Candidates, but that may not apply to you and you acknowledge that you may be charged different rates than other Candidates.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<i>Renewal</i>.\nBoth our Portfolio and Dossier services currently renew automatically.\nUpon renewal of your subscription for any of our Services you will be asked to pay our then-current renewal fees for such renewed subscription.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Non-Payment.</i> You further agree that we may suspend your access to any Services if, at any time, you have not paid all fees that you owe to us.\nIn the event we are unable to collect the fees you owe us, we may take any other steps we deem necessary to collect such fees from you, and that you will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by us in connection with such collection activity, including collection fees, court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nAny amounts not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum legal rate, if less.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Refunds.</i> In the event of termination of a Service as described in Section 10, we may provide you with a refund of any pre-paid, but unused fees related to such Service, effective at the beginning of the next interval (month or year) of your Service in our discretion.\nNo refund shall be paid for the current interval\u2019s Services, regardless of the day on which you cancel the Services.\nWe will issue the refund within 60 days of when your cancellation request is processed.\nYou will not be entitled to any refund for our termination of the Services based upon your breach.\nRequested refunds for other fees or transactions on the site will be granted in our sole discretion.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Promotions.</i> We may run promotional offers from time to time on the Site.\nThe terms of any such promotion will be posted on the Site.\nUnless otherwise indicated, we may establish and modify, in our sole discretion, the terms of such offer and end such offer at any point.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b> OWNERSHIP.</b> You understand and acknowledge that the software,

laws of the District of Columbia, without giving effect to any choice of laws principles that would require the application of the laws of a different country or state.\nYou consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in, and agree to service of process issued or authorized by, any court located in the District of Columbia.\nThese Terms of Use are personal to you, and you may not transfer, assign or delegate your right and/or duties under these Terms of Use to anyone else and any attempted assignment or delegation is void.\nYou acknowledge that we have the right hereunder to seek an injunction, if necessary, to stop or prevent a breach of your obligations hereunder.\nThe paragraph headings in these Terms of Use, shown in boldface type, are included only to help make these Terms of Use easier to read and have no binding effect.\nAny delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nNo waiver by us will have effect unless such waiver is set forth in writing, signed by us.\nnor will any such waiver of any breach or default constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.\nThese Terms of Use constitute the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings,

will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.\nIF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE \u00a71542, WHICH SAYS: \u201cA GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.\u201d</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b> ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, AND FORUM SELECTION CLAUSE.</b> All controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Interfolio arising out of, under, or related to these Terms of Use or our privacy practices (including any action we take or authorize with respect to information about or provided by you) shall be settled exclusively through binding arbitration.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (<b>\u201cAAA\u201d</b>).\nAs modified by these Terms of Use, and unless agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively <b>\u201cRules and Procedures\u201d</b>).</li>\n<li>You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court.\nYour rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.\nYou are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.\nArbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</li>\n<li>You and Interfolio must abide by the following rules: (a) for any claim that could otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions and, if the arbitrator deems it appropriate, a telephonic hearing.\n(b) if the claim exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions or a telephonic hearing, unless the arbitrator deems a face-to-face hearing is appropriate, in which case one should be held at a location agreed to by you and Interfolio, and if the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing, the arbitrator will determine a location for the proceedings which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\n(c) the arbitrator\u2019s ruling is binding and not merely advisory.\n(d) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR INTERFOLIO MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\n(e) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, (f) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Interfolio will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (g) Interfolio also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration.\n(h) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law.\n(i) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or Interfolio shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body and may not be collaterally used against either of them in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person/Interfolio customer.\nand (j) each side pays its own attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees\u2019 and litigation expenses.</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Interfolio may bring an individual action in small claims court.\nIn addition, if you are a user outside of the United States, the dispute resolution provision in our Privacy Policy (if any), and not this arbitration provision, shall apply to any disputes related to privacy.\nFurther, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration provision.\nSuch claims shall be exclusively brought (unless such courts do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the courts located in the District of Columbia.\nAdditionally, notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator\u2019s ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.\nA request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</li>\n<li>With the exception of subparts (d) and (e) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\nIf, however, either subpart (d) or (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Interfolio shall be entitled to arbitration.\nIn the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Interfolio shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts specified in subsection \u201c(d)\u201d above.</li>\n<li>For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at
