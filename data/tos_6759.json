and how long we keep it for.</p>\n<p>When you use our website or read our e-mails, we\u2019ll also collect information that your browser shares with us, like where you are in the world or what links

details how long we keep different kinds of records, why we keep them, and what happens when it\u2019s time to delete these records.\nWe regularly clean up our database and other systems to make sure

data</strong>\n<u>In Short</u>\n<p>We\u2019ll use your information in the way you\u2019ve asked us to, e.g.\nto send you emails or other communications, to provide you with a service you\u2019ve signed up for, or to help you with fundraising, etc.\nYou can ask for us to change your details or preferences (or to remove you altogether) at any time (see \u2018Your Rights\u2019

the following ways:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To <strong>update and enhance</strong> our records.\nPlease note that while we work to ensure the data we hold on you is accurate and up to date, CLAPA cannot be held responsible for confirming the ongoing accuracy of your personal information.\nYou can contact us at any time to change or update your information.</li>\n<li>To provide you with the <strong>information, products and/or services</strong> you\u2019ve requested from us.</li>\n<li>To provide you with the most <strong>relevant information and announcements</strong>, on both a local and national level.\nThis may include research studies which we think may be particularly relevant to you.</li>\n<li>To send you the <strong>kinds of communications you\u2019ve asked to be sent</strong> when signing up, e.g.\nCLAPA News, e-newsletters, etc.\nYou can opt in/out of any kinds of content we send you by following the instructions on the relevant content, or by contacting us directly with your preferences (see \u2018Your Rights\u2019 below).</li>\n<li>To make sure the content on our website and in our emails is presented in the best way for you and your browser or device.</li>\n<li>To <strong>review our services</strong> and the content we provide to make sure it\u2019s right for our users.</li>\n<li>We may <strong>analyse your data</strong> as part of a large set to compile information on our community so we can make sure our services are appropriate and accessible to all.\nFor example, looking at how many people in our community are of a certain ethnic origin, or how many people clicked on a link in one of our emails.</li>\n<li>We do not currently (and have no future plans to) use paid telephone, street or door-to-door<strong> fundraising services</strong>.\nWe will only ever contact you by post or email for fundraising purposes and you may unsubscribe or change your preferences at any time by contacting us.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Sharing your data</strong>\n<u>In Short</u>\n<p>We won\u2019t give, trade or sell your information to anyone else so they can contact you directly without your explicit consent.\nWe only pass on your information to others if they\u2019re working for us (e.g.\nto mail out CLAPA News), and we make sure they take good care of this data while they have it.\nIn rare and extreme circumstances, we may have a legal obligation to share information with the police or other parties.</p>\n<u>In Detail</u>\n<p>All CLAPA Staff have levels of access to our secure database which holds the majority of personal information we may collect.\nOther personal information, e.g.\nsent in emails to staff, may be summarised and stored on our database if staff feel it is necessary to gather a complete record of your history with us.</p>\n<p>Selected volunteers may access this database if their work with us necessitates this, e.g.\nif they are helping us \u2018cleanse\u2019 our database of old addresses, or if they are working with us long-term as an intern.\nThese volunteers sign a data protection agreement and their work is carefully monitored.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Parties</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will never pass on your information to a third party so they can <strong>contact you directly </strong>without your explicit consent.\nYour information will also never be <strong>sold to or \u2018swapped\u2019</strong> with a third party, including other charities or the NHS.</li>\n<li>We may pass on your data to carefully screened third parties for processing to help us <strong>clean up our database </strong>(e.g.\nby removing records of the deceased), or for the <strong>purposes of mass-mailing</strong> (e.g.\nsending CLAPA News).\nThese organisations do not keep your data longer than is absolutely necessary.</li>\n<li>We have previously used carefully-screened third parties to update contact information in our database, e.g.\nto find a new address if someone has moved.\nThis was specifically for the purposes of posting out information about our services.\nAs of 2016, we no longer do this, and only use these services to remove out-of-date information from our database.</li>\n<li>We will not pass on your data for \u2018<strong>wealth screening</strong>\u2019, nor will we use any information (except about your previous donations to CLAPA) to target you for future fundraising.</li>\n<li>We may disclose your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent if we are have a <strong>legal obligation</strong> to do so, or in order to enforce or apply any other agreements you\u2019ve entered into with us.\nThese occasions are<strong> extremely rare</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Storing your data</strong>\n<u>In Short</u>\n<p>We store your data in a few different places for different purposes, but all of these places are secured and comply with all UK and EU data laws.\nWe do not store or have access to payment information provided online.</p>\n<u>In Detail</u>\n<p>We store your data in six key places:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Salesforce database</strong>: this holds most of the personal data and contact information we collect.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CLAPA\u2019s company server: </strong>this is where CLAPA\u2019s files are stored, and this may include temporary copies of mailing lists, copies of letters we\u2019ve sent you, etc.\nThis is also where any information you send us via email is stored until deletion.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Formstack: </strong>this processes any information you send us through one of our website forms and in some cases sends it to our Salesforce database and/or e-mailing lists.\nWe will always indicate on a form what we\u2019ll do with this data and where it will be stored.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Campaign Monitor:</strong> this is what we use to create our e-mailings, and where we store names and email addresses for mailing lists.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CLAPA\u2019s Woo Commerce shop:</strong> this is the \u2018back end\u2019 of our web shop which stores names and addresses of customers, as well as information on what they\u2019ve ordered.\nWe do <u>not</u> store payment information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sage accounting software:</strong> this is where we store information on our customers and anyone we have financial dealings with, e.g.\nvolunteers claiming expenses.\nWe do <u>not</u> store credit card information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everywhere we store your data complies with strict UK and EU regulations on data security and protocols.\nThis includes data centres based in the USA which work to ensure they are fully compliant for organisations, like CLAPA, based in Europe.</p>\n<p>By submitting your personal data to us, you agree to us transferring, storing or processing your data in this way.\nWe take all reasonable steps to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with your right to privacy.</p>\n<p>Payment transactions are handled by <strong>Stripe</strong> and are encrypted using SSL technology.\nSelect CLAPA staff have access to Stripe but for each payment we can only see the last 4 digits and expiry date of a credit or debit card.\nThis helps us track down payments in case of any issues.</p>\n<strong>Fundraising Practices</strong>\n<p>CLAPA is committed to transparent, ethical fundraising practices, and we do everything we can to make our donors and fundraisers confident in how we use their data.\nBelow is a summary of how we may use your information for fundraising.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will not pass on your data for \u2018<strong>wealth screening</strong>\u2019, which is where third parties use your information to tell charities who to target for fundraising or legacies.</li>\n<li>We may use our own information about your <strong>previous donations or fundraising</strong> for CLAPA to contact you about future fundraising.\nIf you are actively fundraising, <strong>we may call you</strong> to catch up or confirm the details of your donations, etc.</li>\n<li>We will only ever contact you by <strong>post or email</strong> to invite you to fundraise or donate, and you can opt out of these asks at any time.</li>\n<li>We do not currently (and have no current plans to) use paid <strong>telephone, street </strong>or <strong>door-to-door fundraising services</strong>.</li>\n<li>We will <strong>not phone or visit you</strong> personally to solicit donations \u2013 anyone claiming to do this on behalf of CLAPA may be committing fraud.</li>\n<li>We will not <strong>share or swap your data</strong> with other charities without your explicit consent, including other cleft charities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>Fundraising Preference Service</strong> is a way for the public to opt out of different kinds of communications from specific charities, including direct mail and fundraising appeals.\nYou\u2019re welcome to submit a request through this service to change how you receive communications from CLAPA.\nHowever, if you contact us directly to change your preferences (or unsubscribe altogether), rest assured we won\u2019t try to change your mind, and we\u2019ll process your request as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>If you have any <strong>concerns about our fundraising practices</strong>, especially if it\u2019s to do with how we handle your data, please get in touch with
