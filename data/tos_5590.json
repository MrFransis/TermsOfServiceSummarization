equivalent data protection standards.</p>\n<p>For example, PMI affiliates within the EEA may transfer personal information to PMI affiliates outside the EEA.\nIn all such cases, the transfer will be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>on the basis of a European Commission adequacy decision;</li>\n<li>subject to appropriate safeguards, for example the EU Model Contracts.\nor</li>\n<li>necessary to discharge obligations under a contract between you and us (or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at your request) or for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in your interest between us and a third party, such as in relation to travel arrangements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In all cases, appropriate security measures for the protection of personal information will be applied in those countries or territories, in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>\n<p>Our service providers are located in many countries throughout the world, including in particular the EEA, Switzerland, the USA, Canada, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Australia.</p> How do we protect information about you? <p>We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to

information you provide.\nWe also require our service providers to comply with strict data privacy and security requirements.</p> How long will information about you be kept? <p>We will retain information about you for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes for which the information was collected.\nAfter that, we will delete it.\nThe period will vary depending on the purposes for which the information was collected.\nNote that in some circumstances, you have the right to request us to delete the information.\nAlso, we are sometimes legally obliged to retain the information, for example, for tax and accounting purposes.</p> Find Out More <p>Typically, we retain data based on the criteria described in the table below:</p> How long will information about you be kept?

digital touchpoint, or respond to our communications.\nHowever, some elements of your profile, such as your history of use of the PMI digital touchpoint, naturally go out of date after a period of time, so we delete them automatically after defined periods as appropriate for the purpose for which we collected them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>system audit logs </li>\n</ul>\n<p>System audit logs are retained typically for a period of only a few months.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;business analytics</li>\n</ul> &nbsp;Business analytics data is typically collected automatically when you use PMI touchpoints and

above.\nHowever, some elements of it, such as some information about whether you opened communications from us (if you choose to share it with us), naturally go out of date after a period of time, so we delete them automatically after defined periods (such as typically after 2 years for e-mail opening data) as appropriate for the purpose for which we collected them.\nWhat rights and options do you have? <p>You may have some or all of the following rights in respect of information about you that we hold:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>request us to give you access to it;</li>\n<li>request us to rectify it,
