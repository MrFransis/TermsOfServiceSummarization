your dealings with us.\nHowever, in some circumstances we may retain personal data for other periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements, or if required to do so by a legal process, legal authority, or other governmental entity having authority to make the request, for so long as required.\n</p>\n<p> With respect to marketing, we retain your personal data for 18 months after your last request for service or other contact you initiate.\n</p> External Links <p> The Site may contain links to third party sites.\nSince Vultr does not control nor is responsible for the privacy practices of those Sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites.\nThis Notice applies solely to personal data collected by our Sites or in the course of our business activities.\n</p> Your Rights <ul>\n<li> Right to withdraw consent - where applicable, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\nFor example, if you wish to opt-out of receiving electronic marketing communications, you can change your settings in your account on the Site, use the 'unsubscribe' link provided in our emails or otherwise contact us directly and we will stop sending you communications.\n</li>\n<li> Right of access, rectification and erasure - you have the right to request access to and obtain a copy of any of your personal data that we may hold, to request correction of any inaccurate data relating to you and to request the deletion of your personal data under certain circumstances.\nYou can see and update most of this data yourself online, or by contacting us directly at http://www.vultr.com/contact/ </li>\n<li> Data portability - where we are relying (as the legal basis for processing) upon your consent, or the fact that the processing is necessary to perform a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract, and the personal data is processed by automatic means, you have the right to receive all such personal data which you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where this is technically feasible.\n</li>\n<li> Right to restriction of processing - you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal data (that is, allow only its storage) where: <ul>\n<li> you contest the accuracy of the personal data, until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy.\n</li>\n<li> where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the personal data.\n</li>\n<li> where we no longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require such personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\nor </li>\n<li> where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below), pending verification as to whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Where your personal data is subject to restriction we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n</li>\n<li> You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority of your habitual residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing of your personal data infringes applicable law.\n</li>\n<li> Right to object to processing (including profiling) based on legitimate interest grounds - where we are relying upon legitimate interests to process personal data, you have the right to object to that processing.\nIf you object, we must stop that processing unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we need to process the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\nWhere we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.\n</li>\n<li> Right to object to direct marketing (including profiling) - you have the right to object to our use of your personal data (including profiling) for direct marketing purposes, such as when we use your personal data to invite you to our promotional events.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Please contact us as indicated in Contact Information http://www.vultr.com/contact/ if you wish to exercise any of your rights, or if you have any inquiries or complaints regarding the processing of your personal data.\n</p> Changes to this Notice <p> We reserve the right to revise, amend, or modify this Notice and our other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner.\nYou should periodically check for any modifications of this Notice by re-visiting this web page and using the 'refresh' button on your browser.\nYou should note the date of last revision to this Notice, which appears at the top of this Notice.\nIf the 'last modified' date remains unchanged after you have clicked the 'refresh' button on your browser, you may presume that no changes have been made since the last reading of the Notice.\nA changed 'last modified' dates indicates that this Notice has been updated or edited, and the updated or edited version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon posting.\n</p> Contact Information <p> If you have any questions in relation to this Notice or you

The SLA applies to packets from Vultr's network to it's providers network.\nIf the packetloss occurs within a third party providers network outside of Vultr's control this SLA does not cover that.\n</p> Limitations The uptime guarantee ONLY applies to network and instance availability during normal operation.\nThe uptime guarantee does NOT apply to server-side software uptime.\nAny outage due to server software, operating systems, improper configurations, denial of service attack against your instance, instance suspension, instance paused/halted for any reason, or any other non-network or non-\"host node\" outage, for any reason and whether or not such outage is caused by Us due to upgrading, troubleshooting or performing any other tasks, is not subject to this uptime guarantee.\nThe guarantee does NOT apply when a scheduled maintenance occurs with a minimum of twenty-four (24) hour notice or in the event a time critical patch/update must be applied as long as the outage/packetloss does not exceed ten (10) minutes.<br>\n<br> Furthermore, none of the guarantees in this SLA may be combined.\nFor example, a hardware outage that also disrupts network activity will not qualify You for two (2) separate credits.\nIf for example, a hardware outage was the basis for the connectivity loss, the entire event will count as one single outage for the purpose of determining applicable credit.\nMore simply put: <p> The SLA applies to the infrastructure in Vultr's control.\nIf you misconfigure your servers, we are not responsible.\nIf Vultr needs to perform scheduled maintenance on your node, this is exempt, unless of course it takes us more than 10 minutes! </p> Outage Credits In accordance with the procedure outlined below, you must initiate a support ticket <strong>and</strong> request that a credit be applied to your account.\nMerely initiating a support ticket related to an outage will not result in any credit to your account.\nInitiating a support ticket and requesting a credit is what triggers an event for any potential credits.\nhowever, Vultr must still determine, in its sole discretion, whether or not an eligible outage has occurred.\nIf Vultr determines that an eligible outage has occurred, then the ticket you generated will be used to generate a credit using the table below:<br>\n<br> Outage Time Frame Credit Amount Less than 9 minutes <strong>12 Hours</strong> 10 \u2013 59 minutes <strong>24 Hours</strong> 60 \u2013 119 minutes <strong>48 Hours</strong> 120 \u2013 239 minutes <strong>120 Hours</strong> 240 \u2013 419 minutes <strong>240 Hours</strong> 420+ minutes <strong>672 Hours (1 Month)</strong>\n<br> How To Obtain Your Credit In order to receive any credit offered under this SLA, You must initiate a support ticket related to the event AND expressly request that We issue a credit.\nDO NOT ASSUME THAT WE ARE AWARE OF YOUR OUTAGE.\nYour outage may be wholly unrelated to Vultr's services, so unless You contact Us via a support ticket, We may not be aware any problem exists.\nOutages related to hardware or other services or events not under Vultr's control are not eligible for any guarantee or credit offered under this SLA.<br>\n<br> You may initiate such support ticket via e-mail to support [at] vultr [dot] com, or the my.vultr.com interface.\nWhichever method You choose, You MUST obtain a Vultr ticket number as proof that you initiated a support ticket related to the outage, and the support ticket MUST ask for a credit related to the outage.\nAs stated herein, the timestamp on the support ticket will mark the beginning of an outage should Vultr determine that an eligible outage occurred.\nIf Vultr was aware of the issue before You were, Vultr may notify You of the outage.\nIn such instance, You must still initiate a support ticket to confirm that You are aware of the outage, and such support ticket must still also request a credit.\nTo be clear, You must have a support ticket number in order to receive any credits under this SLA.<br>\n<br> You agree and acknowledge that all other terms, limitations, exclusions, disclaimers and requirements contained in Vultr's Hosting Terms and Conditions apply to this SLA.\nMore simply put: <p> Open a support ticket to report outages and request SLA credits.\n</p> Products <ul>\n<li> Cloud Compute </li>\n<li> High

use of Vultr's Services (as defined below).\nVultr may modify the terms of this Agreement, including the Fees (as defined below) at any time.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, We may revise this Agreement.\nWe reserve the right to do so, and You agree that We have this unilateral right.\nYou agree that all modifications or changes to this Agreement are in force and enforceable immediately upon posting.\nThe updated or edited version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon posting, and the prior version is of no continuing legal effect unless the revised version specifically refers to the prior version and keeps the prior version or portions thereof in effect.\nTo the extent any amendment of this Agreement is deemed ineffective or invalid by any court, the parties intend that the prior, effective version of this Agreement be considered valid and enforceable to the fullest extent.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that if We change anything in this Agreement, We will change the \"last modified date\" at the top of this Agreement.\nYou agree to periodically re-visit this web page, and to use the \"refresh\" button on Your

presume that nothing in the Agreement has been changed since the last time You read it.\nIf the \"last modified\" date has changed, then You can be certain that something in the Agreement has been changed.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should You wish to terminate this Agreement due to any revisions made by Us, You must do so in writing via the cancellation form within thirty (30)

changes.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiver \u2013 if You fail to periodically review this Agreement to determine if any of the terms have changed, You assume all responsibility for such omission and You agree that such failure amounts to Your affirmative waiver of Your right to review the amended terms.\nWe are not responsible for Your neglect of Your legal rights.\n</p> More simply put: <p> Every so often, we have to update this agreement.\nCheck the date at the top to see the last time it was revised.\n</p>\n<p> Simply continue to use our services to show us that you accept the

renewals thereof) except in the event of a breach by Vultr.\nAfter the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive terms, equal in length to the Initial Term, unless terminated or canceled by either party as provided herein.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vultr may also terminate this Agreement in its sole discretion at any time for any reason or no reason.\n(\"Termination without Cause\").\nIn such case, Vultr will provide You with thirty (30) days written notice before the discontinuation of Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If

paid or prepaid in advance of such cancellation and You shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the effectiveness of such cancellation.\nIn the event that Vultr terminates the Agreement for cause, all prepaid hosting fees will be forfeited and are not refundable.\nThe termination of this Agreement does not relieve You of Your obligation to pay any Fees accrued or payable to Vultr.com prior to the effective date of termination of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to Vultr's right to terminate this Agreement provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Vultr may terminate this Agreement effective immediately if, based on Vultr's sole judgment, it determines that You or any of Your end-users: (a) have breached the Acceptable Use Policy (\"AUP\") as described in Section 12 of this Agreement, and incorporated herein, (b) have infringed or violated any intellectual property right or privacy or publicity right of a third party, (c) have not complied with any applicable law, statute or regulation, or (d) have uploaded, published or disseminated any images, text, graphics, code or video which Vultr considers illegal or high risk, in

cancels or terminates this Agreement for any reason, You shall be solely responsible for making all necessary arrangements for securing a replacement host and moving all electronic data, graphics, images, video or text to the new service provider.\nUpon termination of this Agreement, provisions that by their nature would be expected to survive termination shall survive and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.\n</p> More simply put: <p> We require that you keep your services running until after the initial term.\nVultr reserves the right to cancel your services anytime, but we really don't want to! </p>\n<p> Liabilities resulting from your content is your responsibility.\nIf we have to cancel this agreement, it is up to you to move your content to another provider.\n</p> 4.\nACCOUNT SET UP <p>\n<b>4.1</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When You register for the Services, You will choose a login (email) and password.\nYou may use the Services or modify Your data and

responsibility to make sure that Our domain(s), vultr.com, are not included in any spam block list used by You or Your mail provider.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.3</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Providing false or inaccurate contact information of any kind may result in the Termination for Cause of Your account per Section 3 of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are responsible for all activity transpiring under Your account.\nWe therefore highly recommend that You secure file, directory, and script permissions to the most restrictive settings possible.\nYou agree that You have the technical ability to properly operate a web site and that You are responsible for any actions performed under Your account, including but not limited to, damage caused to Your site, Vultr's site

complaint.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.5</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You understand that even a nominal amount of damages may require the expenditure of extensive legal fees, travel expenses, costs, and other amounts that may dwarf the liquidated damages themselves.\nYou agree that You will pay all of these fees and costs.\n</p> More simply put: <p> All of your content belongs to you - not Vultr! You are simply granting Vultr permission to link your content to the internet.\n</p>\n<p> If we end up providing you with any additional software, the terms of this agreement apply to it.\n</p>\n<p> We hope that you love the Vultr service, but there are some legal boundaries when it comes to using our names and trademark.\nReach out to us before doing so.\n</p>\n<p> Misuse of our service can be costly to us.\nIf misuse ends in damages, you may have to reimburse our legal fees.\n</p> 6&nbsp;DMCA Notice and Takedown Policy <p>\n<b>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Vultr.com

U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512.\ncommonly known as the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the DMCA.\nVultr's infringement notification procedure, counter-notification procedure, and takedown policies, are set forth below.</b>\n</p> More simply put: <p> Vultr respects the intellectual property of third parties and complies with the US DMCA.\nOur DMCA policies are explained in the following sections.\n</p> 7&nbsp;Notice of Claimed Infringement <p>\n<b>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abuse Warning</b>\n</p>\n<p> The DMCA permits copyright owners, or their authorized agents, to submit notifications to service providers, such as Vultr, requesting that infringing material hosted on Vultr's servers be disabled or removed.\nImportantly, the DMCA imposes significant penalties \u2013 including court costs and attorneys fees \u2013 on those who abuse the infringement notification procedure, by misrepresenting either that material is infringing, or was removed by mistake.\nSee.\n17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512(f).\nVultr will pursue those who abuse its DMCA notice or counter-notification procedure, and will cooperate with law enforcement in any investigation of such abuse.\nPlease make sure that you meet all the qualifications before submitting a DMCA notice to our Designated Agent identified below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.2.\nNotification Contents and Procedure</b>\n</p>\n<p> If you believe that your
