where you live in the world.\n<strong>That\u2019s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as \u201cpersonal data,\u201d no matter where the individual lives.</strong> This means that data that directly identifies you \u2014 such as your name \u2014 is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you \u2014 such as the serial number of your device \u2014 is personal data.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores).\nApple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store.\nApple\u2019s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it.\nWe encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li> Your Privacy Rights at Apple <p>At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data.\nWe have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple.\nApple does not sell your data including as \u201csale\u201d is defined in Nevada and California.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To exercise your privacy rights and choices, visit the Apple Privacy Portal at </strong>privacy.apple.com<strong> for Apple or </strong>shazam.com/privacy<strong> for Shazam.\n</strong>To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified.\nIf the Privacy Portal is not available in your region, you can make privacy rights requests at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There may be situations where we cannot grant your request \u2014 for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law.\nWe may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns.\nOther reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you live in California,</em> if you

policies to protect your information, and is leading the industry by adopting privacy-preserving technologies like end-to-end encryption for your data.</p> Data security <p>iCloud secures your information by encrypting it when it's in transit, storing it in iCloud in an encrypted format, and using secure tokens for authentication.\nFor certain sensitive information, Apple uses end-to-end encryption.\nThis means that only you can access your information, and&nbsp;only on devices where you\u2019re signed into iCloud.\nNo one else, not even Apple, can access end-to-end encrypted information.</p>\n<p>In some cases, your iCloud data may be stored using third-party partners\u2019 servers\u2014such as Amazon Web Services or&nbsp;Google Cloud Platform\u2014but these partners don\u2019t have the keys&nbsp;to decrypt your data stored on&nbsp;their servers.</p>\n<p>End-to-end encryption requires that you have&nbsp;two-factor authentication&nbsp;turned on for your Apple ID.\nKeeping your software up-to-date and using two-factor authentication are the most important things that you can do to maintain the security of your devices and data.</p>\n<p>Here's more detail on how iCloud protects your data.</p>\n<strong>Data</strong>\n<strong>Encryption</strong>\n<strong>Notes</strong>\n<strong>In transit</strong>\n<strong>On server</strong>\nBackup\nYes\nYes\nA minimum of

iCloud.com are encrypted with TLS 1.2.\nAny data accessed via iCloud.com is encrypted on server as indicated in this table.\nMail\nYes\nNo\nAll traffic between your devices and iCloud Mail&nbsp;is encrypted with TLS 1.2.\nConsistent with standard industry practice, iCloud does not encrypt data stored on IMAP mail servers.\nAll Apple email clients support optional S/MIME encryption.\nEnd-to-end encrypted data <p>End-to-end encryption provides the highest level of data security.\nYour data is protected with a key derived from information unique to your device, combined with your device passcode, which only you know.\nNo one else can access or read this data.</p>\n<p>These features and their data are transmitted and stored in iCloud using end-to-end encryption:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Card transactions (requires iOS 12.4 or later)</li>\n<li>Home data</li>\n<li>Health data (requires iOS 12 or later)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>iCloud Keychain (includes all of your saved accounts and passwords)</li>\n<li>Maps Favorites, Collections and search history (requires iOS 13 or later)</li>\n<li>Memoji (requires iOS 12.1 or later)</li>\n<li>Payment information</li>\n<li>QuickType Keyboard learned vocabulary (requires iOS 11 or later)</li>\n<li>Safari History and iCloud Tabs (requires iOS 13 or later)</li>\n<li>Screen Time</li>\n<li>Siri information</li>\n<li>Wi-Fi passwords</li>\n<li>W1 and H1 Bluetooth keys (requires iOS 13 or later)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To access your data on a new device, you might have to enter the passcode for an existing or former device.</p>\n<p>Messages in iCloud also uses end-to-end encryption.\nIf you have&nbsp;iCloud Backup turned on, your backup includes a copy of the key protecting your Messages.&nbsp;This ensures you can recover your Messages if&nbsp;you lose&nbsp;access to iCloud Keychain and&nbsp;your trusted devices.\nWhen you turn off iCloud Backup, a new key is generated&nbsp;on your device&nbsp;to protect future messages&nbsp;and isn't stored by Apple.</p> Two-factor authentication <p>With two-factor authentication, your account can only be accessed on devices you trust, like your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\nWhen you want to sign in with your Apple ID on a new&nbsp;device the first time, you need to provide two pieces of information\u2014your password and the six-digit verification code that's auto-displayed&nbsp;on your trusted devices.</p> Use of secure tokens for authentication <p>When you access iCloud services with Apple\u2019s built-in apps (for example, Mail, Contacts, and Calendar apps on iOS or macOS), authentication is handled using a secure token.\nSecure tokens eliminate the need to store your iCloud password on devices and computers.</p> Health data <p>End-to-end encryption for Health data requires iOS 12 or later and two-factor authentication.\nOtherwise, your data is still encrypted in storage and transmission but is not encrypted end-to-end.\nAfter you turn on two-factor authentication and update iOS, your Health data is migrated to end-to-end encryption.</p>\n<p>If you back up your device on&nbsp;your Mac or iTunes, Health data is stored only if the backup is encrypted.</p> Privacy <p>Apple has a company-wide commitment to your privacy.\nOur Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information.\nAnd in addition to adhering to the Apple Privacy Policy, Apple designs all iCloud features with your privacy in mind.</p> Learn more <p>Learn more about advanced security features in the&nbsp;iOS Security

services that rely upon device-based location information using GPS (or similar technology, where available) and crowdsourced Wi-Fi access points and cell tower locations.\nTo provide such features or services, where available, Apple and its partners and licensors must collect, use, transmit, process and maintain your location data, including but not limited to the geographic location of your device and information related to your iCloud account (\u201cAccount\u201d) and any devices registered thereunder, including but not limited to your Apple ID, device ID and name, and device type.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may withdraw consent to Apple and its partners\u2019 and licensors\u2019 collection, use, transmission, processing and maintenance of location and Account data at any time by

in Settings (as applicable) on your device.\nWhen using third party services that use or provide location data as part of the Service, you are subject to and should review such third party\u2019s terms and privacy policy on use of location data by such third party services.\nAny location data provided by the Service is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage.\nApple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the Service, but neither Apple nor any of its service and/or content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data or any other data displayed by the Service.&nbsp;<u>LOCATION-BASED SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE AS AN EMERGENCY LOCATOR SYSTEM.</u>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b> B.\nFind My </b>\n</p>\n<p>When you enable iCloud and Location Services on a device running iOS 13, iPad OS or macOS Catalina or later, Find My (Find My iPhone for devices running iOS 8 through iOS 12) will be

before anyone (including you) can turn off Find My, sign out of iCloud, erase or activate the device.&nbsp.\nApple and its authorized agents may not perform hardware or software support services, including services under Apple\u2019s limited warranty, unless you disable Find My prior to service.&nbsp.\nApple shall bear no responsibility for your failure to protect your iOS device with a passcode, enable Lost Mode, and/or receive or respond to notices and communications.&nbsp.\nApple shall also bear no responsibility for returning your iOS device to you or for any loss of data on your iOS device.</p>\n<p>Offline Finding is a crowdsourcing feature that can help you and others locate missing devices when those devices are not connected to the internet.\nIf Offline Finding is enabled on a device, it can detect the presence of nearby offline devices via Bluetooth (or similar technologies).\nIf a device detects a missing offline device, it will use Wi-Fi or cellular connections to securely report the approximate location of the device back to the Apple ID associated with the device so the owner can view its location in the Find My app.\nLocation reporting is end-to-end encrypted, and Apple cannot see the location of the reporting device or any offline device.\nYou can disable Offline Finding in Settings.</p>\n<p>\n<b> C.\nBackup</b>\n</p>\n<p>iCloud Backup
