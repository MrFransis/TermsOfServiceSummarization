https://www.myheritage.com and how you can control our use of cookies.\nBy visiting our website, you consent to our use of cookies and similar technologies as described in this Cookie Policy.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>What are cookies, and why does MyHeritage use them?</b>\n<br>\n<br> Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, that are downloaded to your browsing device (such as a computer, mobile device or smartphone) when you visit some websites, including our website.\nCookies help websites know if the browsing device has visited them previously and help improve the functionality of the services provided on the website.\nFor example, every time you visit such a site you can be logged in automatically, and the website will remember your preferences.\nSome cookies are associated with your account and personal information (as defined in our Privacy Policy, located at https://www.myheritage.com/privacy-policy), while others are not.\nBoth first-party cookies and third-party cookies (described below) can serve a number of different functions, such as tracking, marketing and directed advertising.\nIn addition to using cookies we may also use other automated means of data collection similar to cookies, such as \u201cclear gifs\u201d, flash cookies and pixels, and when we refer to cookies in this Cookie Policy we\u2019re referring to cookies and such other automated means.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>What are the different types of cookies?</b>\n<br>\n<br> MyHeritage uses both \"first-party cookies\" and \"third-party cookies\".\nFirst-party cookies are cookies that belong to MyHeritage, whereas third-party cookies are cookies that another party places on your browsing device through our website.\nThird-party cookies will generally be providing a service to MyHeritage, but we cannot control how those third-party cookies are used.\nYou should check the third party\u2019s website for more information on how they use cookies.\nIn addition, please note that the parties that set third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits our website and when it visits certain other websites or mobile applications.\n<br>\n<br> In addition, MyHeritage may use both \u201csessions cookies\u201d and \u201cpersistent cookies\u201d.\nSession cookies are only stored on your device during a single browsing session to the site and are automatically deleted when you close your browser.\nPersistent cookies remain on your device until they are set to expire or until you or your browser delete the cookies.\n<br>\n<br> For these purposes, MyHeritage may use the following categories of cookies on our website:<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Mandatory cookies</b>, which enable you to move around this site and use its features.\nWithout these cookies, services that are necessary for you to be able to use our website, such as ensuring that you stay logged on or remembering what is in your shopping basket, cannot be provided.\nand</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\n<b>Tracking and Advertising cookies,</b> some of which are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests.\nThey are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign.\nThey are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission, which means that if you cease to use our services you may see some advertisements about our services elsewhere on the Internet.\nIn addition, some of these cookies collect information about how visitors use the website, such as which pages visitors go to most often and if they receive error messages from web pages.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How to manage your cookie preferences?</b>\n<br>\n<br> To manage your cookie preferences, visit the \u201cMy cookie preferences\u201d tab by going to \u201cSettings\u201d \u2013 \u201cPrivacy\u201d \u2013 \u201cMy cookie preferences\u201d.\nOn the \u201cMy cookie preferences\u201d page you can disable tracking and advertising cookies, but you may experience some loss of function in the services we provide.\nPlease note, that we provide some third-party services (such as Facebook like buttons on our blog and embedded Vimeo videos) that place their own cookies on your browser, and such services can only be used if their cookies are not disabled.\nAs a result, the specific cookies cannot be disabled.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How to manage cookies via your browser settings?</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>First-party cookies</i>\n<br>\n<br>You can use the browser that you are using to view the website to enable, disable or delete cookies.\nTo do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the \"Help\", \"Tools\" or \"Edit\"
