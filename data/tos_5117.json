(\u201cInnoGames\u201d, \u201cWe\u201d) is the data controller in respect of your personal data and is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and personal integrity when you are using the mobile apps and online games as well as portals and websites offered by us (together \u201cServices\u201d).\nThis Privacy Policy will help you understand what personal data we collect about you, why it is collected and how it is used by us.\nIt will clarify how you can exer-cise your rights when you trust us to handle your personal data for you.\nWe ask that you take a moment to read this Privacy Policy carefully and familiarize yourself with its content.\nIf you have any questions, you are welcome to contact us by using the contact information provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p> Please note that our Services may contain links to websites that can be held by partner com-panies.\nIf you follow a link to any of these websites or use these third-party services, you should be aware that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not assume any liability for their processing of your personal data.\nTherefore, please make sure to read their privacy policies before providing your personal data to them.\n</p>\n<p> We offer our Services only to players who are at least 16 years old.\nHence, we do not knowingly market to or solicit personal data from persons under the age of 16.\n</p> II.\nName and address of the controller <p> The controller in line with the General Data Protection Regulation and other national data protection laws of the member states, as well as other legal data protection provisions, is: </p>\n<p> InnoGames GmbH<br> Friesenstra\u00dfe 13<br> 20097 Hamburg<br> Fax: +49 40 7889335-200<br> E-Mail: privacy@innogames.com<br> Website: www.innogames.com<br>\n</p> III.\nName and address of the data protection officer <p>The data protection officer of the controller is:</p>\n<p> Lawyer and bar-certified specialist in information technology law<br> Dr.\nChristian Rauda<br> GRAEF Rechtsanw\u00e4lte Digital PartG mbB<br> Jungfrauenthal 8<br> 20149 Hamburg<br> E-Mail: dpo@innogames.com<br> Website: www.graef.eu </p> IV.\nGeneral information on data processing 1.\nScope of personal data processing <p> In general, we record only the personal data which you disclose when using Services as part of your login or registration and possibly during use of fee-based services.\nPersonal data are those which contain information about personal or factual circumstances.\nWhen logging in and registering as a user on our website, you only have to provide an email address and, if applicable, a username and password.\nWhen registering for certain Services, email addresses are not collected during registration but only later during the use of the Service.\nThe password is stored in hasehd form, which never allows for an inference of the actual password.\n</p>\n<p> In the context of implementing the concluded user contract, particularly in the context of fee-based Services you have chosen, the disclosure of further data, such as the full name, address, account details, credit card numbers, etc., may be required.\nIt is sometimes also necessary to request personal information such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number for the purposes of processing your inquiries or providing you with support.\nInnoGames will handle these data confidentially and in compliance with the legal data protection provisions.\nIn principle, InnoGames will not disclose such information to third parties without your permission, unless this is required for the implementation and execution of the contract, for processing your request or for your support or in the case of a legal permit.\n</p> 2.\nLegal basis for personal data processing <p> Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, Art.\n6(1)(a) of EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for personal data processing.\n</p>\n<p> In personal data processing required for the fulfilment of a contract of which the data subject is a party, Art.\n6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis.\nThis also applies to the processing required in order to carry out pre-contractual actions.\n</p>\n<p> Insofar as personal data processing is required for the fulfilment of a legal obligation which our company is subject to, Art.\n6(1)(c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.\n</p>\n<p> In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require personal data processing, Art.\n6(1)(d) GDPR serves as the legal basis.\n</p>\n<p> If processing is required to protect the legitimate interests of our company or of a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the interests mentioned first, Art.\n6(1)(f) serves as the legal basis for processing.\n</p> 3.\nDeletion of data and duration of storage <p> The personal data of the data subject are deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage no longer exists.\nIn addition, such storage may occur if this is provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject.\nThe blocking or deletion of data also occurs when the storage period prescribed in the abovementioned regulations lapses, unless further storage of the data is required for conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.\n</p> 4.\nData security <p> InnoGames makes reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorised access to your personal data as well as unauthorised use or falsification of these data and to minimise the corresponding risks.\nHowever, the provision of personal data, whether it be in person, over the phone or over the Internet, always involves risks and no technological system is completely free of the possibility of being manipulated or sabotaged.\n</p>\n<p> InnoGames processes the information collected from you in accordance with German and European data protection law.\nAll employees are obliged to comply with data secrecy and data protection provisions and are instructed in this regard.\nYour data are transmitted in an en-crypted form using the SSL method.\n</p> V.\nProvision of our services and creation of log files 1.\nDescription and scope of data processing <p> Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the accessing computer.\n</p>\n<p> The following data are collected here: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Internet protocol</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>URL of the referring website from which the file was requested</li>\n<li>Date and time of access</li>\n<li>Browser type and operating system</li>\n<li>the page visited by you</li>\n<li>amount of transferred data</li>\n<li>access status (file transferred, file not found etc.),</li>\n<li>duration and frequency of use</li>\n</ul>\n<p> The data is also stored in the log files of our system.\n</p>\n<p> When accessing mobile apps, the following data and information are collected: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Internet protocol</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>date and time of access</li>\n<li>device type and operating system</li>\n<li>amount of transferred data</li>\n<li>access status (file transferred, file not found etc.),</li>\n<li>duration and frequency of use</li>\n<li>Google Play IDs and Game Center IDs can possibly be stored to log you in to several devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> If an error occurs during the use of our Services and we want to rectify this, we may also col-lect other data, e.g.\nPlayer ID and username.\n</p> 2.\nLegal basis for data processing <p> The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is provided by Art.\n6(1)(f) GDPR.\n</p> 3.\nPurpose of data processing <p> The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to allow delivery of the Services to the computer of the user.\nFor this purpose, the user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.\n</p>\n<p> The storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the Services.\nIn addition, the data is used by us in order to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.\nEvaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.\nOnly a statistical evaluation of datasets takes place.\n</p>\n<p> InnoGames reserves the right to store IP addresses and log files for a maximum period of 30 days after the website is used to monitor compliance with the terms of use and rules of the game.\nIn particular, this procedure is used to prevent any cases of abuse or to resolve them and, on a case-by-case basis, to pass on the data for this purpose to investigative authorities.\nApart from that, any other analysis of data is done in anonymous form as much as possible.\nAfter the end of this period, the IP address and log files are completely deleted, unless there are mandatory statutory storage requirements or specific prosecution- and abuse investigation proceedings pending.\n</p>\n<p> These purposes also constitute our legitimate and predominant interest in data processing according to Art.\n6(1)(f) GDPR.\n</p> 4.\nStorage duration <p> The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to fulfil the purpose of their collection.\nIn the case when data are collected for the purpose of making the website availa-ble, this is the case when the respective session is over.\n</p>\n<p> Log files which contain personal data are generally deleted after seven days at the latest.\nAd-ditional storage is possible in the case of so-called error logs which allow us to fix errors.\nThese error logs are deleted after maximum 30 days, collected IP addresses are anonymised after 30 days.\n</p> 5.\nPossibility of objection and removal <p> The collection of data for the purpose of making the website available and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website.\nAs a consequence, there is no objection possibility on the part of the user.\n</p> VI.\nInquiries via contact form, email, and support tool 1.\nDescription and scope of data processing a)\tContact form <p> On our website, a contact form is available which can be used to contact us electronically.\nShould a user choose this option, the data entered in the input mask will be transmitted to us and stored.\nThese data are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Message</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Additionally, at the point of sending the message, the following data are stored: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP address of the user</li>\n<li>Date and time of submission</li>\n</ul>\n<p> For the processing of the data, reference is made to this privacy policy in the context of the submission process.\n</p> b) Email <p> Alternatively, it is possible to contact us via our provided email addresses.\nIn this case, the personal data of the user transmitted with the email are stored.\n</p> c)\tSupport tool <p> Alternatively, you can contact us via our support tool integrated into our Service.\nIt will then store your user data and the content of the support inquiry as well as the time of the inquiry.\n</p>\n<p> No data are transmitted to third parties in this context.\nThe data are used exclusively for the processing of the conversation.\n</p> 2.\nLegal basis <p> Legal basis for data processing is Art.\n6(1)(f) GDPR.\nIf the e-mail contact is aimed to conclude a contract or serves the contract execution, additional legal basis for the processing is Art.\n6(1)(b) GDPR.\n</p> 3.\nAim of data processing <p> The processing of the personal data serves us only to process the contact and the support request.\nThe other personal data processed during the submission process serve to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.\n</p> 4.\nStorage duration <p> The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to fulfil the purpose of their collection.\n</p> 5.\nPossibility of objection and removal <p> At any time after contacting us, you have the option to object to personal data processing, regardless of whether this was done via a contact form, email or support tool.\nIn such a case, the conversation cannot continue and your concern may not be conclusively handled.\nAll per-sonal data stored in the course of contacting will be deleted in this case.\nThis shall not apply if mandatory statutory retention requirements preclude this.\n</p> VII.\nSubmission of newsletters <p> You can subscribe on our websites or in our games for a newsletter on the respective game.\nFor this, we require your email address.\n</p>\n<p> In addition, we must verify, taking into consideration the relevant legal regulations, that you are the actual owner of the provided email address and wish to receive the newsletter.\nFor this purpose, we send you a validation email.\n</p>\n<p> Our newsletters contain a pixel-size image (tracking pixels), which is retrieved by a server of the newsletter sender when the newsletter is opened.\nAs part of this retrieval, technical information, such as information about your browser or operating system, as well as your IP address, location, and time of retrieval, is collected.\nThis information is anonymised and evaluated independently of the individual.\n</p>\n<p> Since the submission and receipt of the newsletter depend on your consent, you can revoke this consent for collection and storage of your data at any time without providing the reasons for it.\nFor this purpose, use the unsubscribe link which can be found at the end of our newsletter.\n</p>\n<p> Additionally, you have the option to opt-out of receiving newsletters in the Data Usage Window inside any of our games under \u201cSettings\u201d.\n</p> VIII.\nSubmission of push notifications 1.\nDescription and scope of data processing <p> If you have selected the appropriate settings on your device, InnoGames can send push notifications to your mobile device to give you updates for games and other relevant news.\nYou can manage push notifications on the page \u201cOptions\u201d or \u201cSettings\u201d in the mobile app or in the settings of your device.\n</p> 2.\nLegal basis for data processing <p> The legal basis for data processing in the presence of a contract is according to Art.\n6(1)(b) GDPR.\n</p> 3.\nPurpose of data processing <p> Push notifications are special notifications which are displayed directly on your mobile device.\nThe notifications contain, for instance, the information that one of your buildings in the game has been completed.\nAs a rule, push notifications contain short messages which focus on the essential.\n</p> 4.\nStorage duration <p> The messages are stored within our push gateway for up to 21 days.\nThe messages are also stored in anonymised form in our event tracking system for an indefinite amount of time.\nTo our knowledge, messages may be stored by the supplier of your mobile device.\n</p> 5.\nPossibility of objection and removal <p>You can switch off the push notifications
