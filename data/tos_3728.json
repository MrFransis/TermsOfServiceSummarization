Domain Names</b>.\nBy registering domains with NameBright.com, you expressly agree and authorize NameBright.com to act as your Designated Agent as defined by ICANN's transfer policy.\nYou expressly agree and authorize NameBright.com to approve each change of registrant on your behalf.\nWhen the prior registrant of a domain name requests that (a.)

agree to the terms of the privacy policy for every domain name registered, and how such information can and will be used.\nAny third parties registering domain names (Registered Agents) will represent this to any third-party whose personal data have been supplied in order to manage said domain names on their behalf.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>11.<b>Provisions Concerning Specific TLD Registrations</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>.Com</u>\n<u> and .Net Registrations</u>.\nYou agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the .COM and .NET Registry Operator, VeriSign, Inc., and its directors, officers, employees, agents, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses arising out of or relating to the Registered Name holder's domain name registration.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>12.<b>Registrar's Deletion and Auto-Renewal Policies</b>.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>With auto-renew off</u>: Should you choose to disable the auto-renewal function in your NameBright account for any domain, and you have chosen to manually renew your domain each year, NameBright will make multiple attempts to notify you that the domain name is approaching its expiration date and that you will need to take steps to renew your domain.\nNameBright will send you an email approximately one month prior to the domain name's expiration date.\nThis will be the first warning that your domain name is about to expire.\nNameBright will then send another email approximately one week before the domain name's expiration date.\nFinally, if the domain name is not renewed by the expiration date of the domain, NameBright will send a final notification about the domain name's expiration.\nWhile not contracted to do so, NameBright may send more notifications in order to help protect its customers and to help prevent domain names from accidental expiration.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>With auto-renew on</u>: If you have auto-renew turned on you are asking NameBright to automatically charge the payment method(s) you have on file for the domain's yearly renewal fees.\nNameBright will attempt to renew the domain based on the advanced setting \"Domain Auto-Renewal\" found in My Account &gt.\nSettings &gt.\nAdvanced.\nThis setting will tell NameBright how many days before the domain name's expiration that the auto-renew should be processed.\nThe default setting for auto-renewal is 14-days prior to the domain name's expiration date.\nWhen NameBright attempts to renew a domain with auto-renew on, it will first look for an available funded account balance, and then cycle through each of the credit cards on file in attempt to make the auto-renewal payment.\nIf these auto-renewal attempts fail, NameBright will send you an email notifying you of the auto-renewal failure and try to render payment again the following day.\nYou may need to take manual steps to remedy the payment method or to make payment for your domain renewal to be successful.\nIf your domain does not auto-renew within the designated number of days configured, the domain name will be allowed to expire due to non-payment by the auto-renewal.\nPresuming you keep this setting at 14-days, this means you will receive 14 auto-renewal failure notices via email before the domain name expires.\nWhile you can set your auto-renew setting to as little as 1-day, NameBright does not recommend this as a billing failure will mean the domain name will expire the following day, will become unusable, email will stop working and the respective website will go offline.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If your domain expires, NameBright will send an email within 24 hours of the expiration occurring.\nNameBright will also send a final email about your domain expiration one week after the domain name has expired, to give you a final notice your domain name is about to become available for someone else to register and use.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>13.<b>Expired Domain Process</b>.\nUpon expiration of your domain name, your nameservers will be changed to expired1.namebrightdns.com and expired2.namebrightdns.com as is required by ICANN's ERRP (Expired Registration Recovery Policy).\nDuring this time your domain will have all services interrupted (including but not limited to email, web hosting, ftp servers, etc.) During this expiration process you will be allowed to renew the domain for the standard renewal cost of that domain which is designated by the TLD's current price as reflected on NameBright.com at that time.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The registrant of an expired domain will be given no less than 30 days to pay for the renewal of the domain before the domain enters a Redemption Grace Period (\"RGP\").\nDomain names at NameBright move from \"expired\" status to RGP status on the 30th day after a domain name's expiration date.\nDue to processing constraints, on rare occasions this date might be up to 10 days later.\nAs a registrant you should expect this will happen on the 30th day after a domain name expires.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>NameBright has absolutely no liability for domains that were allowed to expire due to user error, non-payment, and billing failure.\nNameBright will make reasonable attempts to provide ample notification to customers about potential domain name expirations when applicable, but NameBright is not liable in situations where a domain is allowed to expire for any reason.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>14.<b>Domain Deletion / Redemption Grace Period Recovery</b>.\nIf you fail to renew your domain through the end of the expiration of the domain (30 days from the domain name's expiration date) that domain will enter Redemption Grace Period (aka \"RGP\").\nOnce a domain enters RGP status you will have 30 days to \"redeem\" the domain at the standard redemption period price.\nThe cost to redeem a .com or .net domain from RGP is currently $85 per domain.\nNon .com or .net domains will be charged $85, or the registry's redemption fee.\nwhichever cost is greater.\nAny domain that goes beyond the 30-day Redemption Grace Period (in addition to the previous 30 days of auto-renew grace period) will be ineligible for redemption of any kind.\nMeaning 60 days after the domain name's expiration date the registrant can no longer take any steps to recover a non-renewed domain.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>There are two processes in which domains will go through RGP at NameBright.com.\nRegistry Redemption Grace Period (\"Registry RGP\") and Registrar Redemption Grace Period (\"Registrar RGP\").\nIn the case of Registrar RGP, the domain name may be auctioned off or sold to third parties who have an interest in the domain beginning on the 30th day after the domain name has expired.\nShould a third-party purchase rights to the domain, you will have exactly 30 days from the beginning of RGP to pay the redemption fee to have the domain name returned to you.\nShould the redemption fee not be paid within 60 days after the domain name's expiration, the ownership of the domain will change hands and be irreversible.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In the case of Registry RGP, the domain name will be deleted and go through the registry's RGP process.\nThis period is mandated to be the 30 days immediately following the deletion of a registration.\nTherefore, presuming the domain name is deleted at the registry on the 30th day after the domain name's expiration, you will have 30 days following that date to redeem the domain name for the standard redemption cost of $85.\nAgain, if you do not redeem a domain before the end of this redemption grace period, the domain will drop and become available for anyone to use.\nIn many cases, you can lose permanent rights and access to the domain.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In other words, <u>if the domain name is not renewed or redeemed within 60 days following the expiration, the domain will be irretrievable</u>.\nDuring the first 30 days you can pay the basic renewal fee.\nIn the second 30 days the Redemption fee, for .com and .net domains this cost is $85.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>15.<b>Privacy Protection</b>.\nIf you choose to use privacy protection provided by NameBright you agree that you will not abuse the service and should any involvement / interaction be required on NameBright's behalf you will be charged a $150 \"Whois privacy protection maintenance fee\".\nThis includes, but is not limited to, legal services required from operating said domain, disputes over your domain or mediation of some form concerning the domain.\nIf your accounts are found to be problematic, for any reason whatsoever, NameBright has the full right to terminate and remove privacy protection on any and all domain names in your account.\nIf you are doing anything illegal or questionably illegal on a domain name that is privacy protected, your privacy protection will be removed immediately and/or shared with a complaining party who bears what seems to be a legitimate issue.\nYou acknowledge that privacy protection is a privilege and not a right and you expressly grant NameBright absolute right and power.\nBy using NameBright's privacy protection services you consent that your personal information is not 100% protected.\nFor iron clad privacy in Whois, NameBright suggests you hire an attorney and have that attorney be the primary contact on your domain.\nIf NameBright receives a UDRP on a domain name that has privacy protected turned on, privacy protection will be removed during the dispute.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that in using privacy protection services, NameBright will review and forward certain communications addressed to a privacy protected domain at its own digression.\nIn using privacy protection, you acknowledge you are pointing ownership of the domain to NameBright.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that certain domain registries do not allow privacy protection.\nSome example extensions that do not allow privacy protection are: .asia, .bz, .in, .ca, .ch, .cn, .co.uk, .com.au, .com.es, .com.sg, .de, .es, .eu, .fr, .li, .me.uk, .net.au, .nom.es, .nu, .org.au, .org.es, .org.uk, .sg, .us</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>16.<b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b>.\nBy using NameBright.com and its services you expressly agree that you have read and agree NameBright's privacy policy.\nShould you not agree to NameBright's privacy policy you agree that you will not use NameBright's systems and services.\nNameBright additionally provides an advanced section of each users' account which allows all living persons of European member countries to either opt-in and/or opt-out of such public whois details.\nTo set GDPR privacy, navigate to My Account &gt.\nAdvanced &gt.\nGDPR Privacy Setting, and set this to \"enabled\".</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>17.<strong>Abuse and Removal of Privacy Protection</strong>.\nNameBright has the right, upon its sole discretion to remove a customer's privacy protection for any of the following reasons:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>a.<u>Illegal Activity</u>\n</p>\n<p>NameBright.com has the right to remove a customer's privacy protection without any notice upon notification of a customer's involvement in any (a.) illegal, (b.) malicious or (c.) harmful activity on a domain registered with NameBright.\nNameBright.com has a zero-tolerance policy to the abuse of its services to engage in illegal, malicious, or harmful activities.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>b.<u>UDRP</u>\n</p>\n<p>Upon receiving notice of that a Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy Complaint and confirmation that the arbitration process regarding the Complaint has been commenced, NameBright is required by ICANN to immediately remove any privacy protection on that domain name and lock said domain from any outbound transfer or account change.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>c.<u>ICANN Whois Inaccuracy Complaint</u>\n</p>\n<p>Should NameBright receive a Whois Inaccuracy Complaint on a domain name, it will email the customer in order to acquire the necessary information and conduct an investigation.\nShould the customer fail to respond to this correspondence, their domain will be suspended and privacy protection will be removed from all domains in that customer's account without notice.\nIt is mandatory the customer respond to these inquiries and failure to do so will result in the loss of the privilege of using privacy protection.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>d.<u>Court Order or Subpoena</u>\n</p>\n<p>Upon receipt of any legitimate and binding Court Order or Subpoena, NameBright may, upon requirement by law or by its own discretion, remove privacy protection from a customer's domain and/or account in order to obey any relevant laws and to ensure all customers are using their domains in legitimate and legal manners.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>e.<u>Any Reason Deemed Necessary</u>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the above reasons, NameBright may remove privacy protection form a customer's domain and/or account for any compelling reason and at NameBright's sole discretion.\nNameBright.com is not required to give any notice or provide any reason for removing privacy protection.\nPrivacy protection is an added and voluntary service that is to be a privilege.\nNameBright will not tolerate any abuse of this voluntary service.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>18.<strong>One Year Free Privacy Protection</strong>.\nAll domain names registered through NameBright (which are eligible for privacy protection) may receive one (1) year of free privacy protection.\nThis promotion is applicable for new domain registrations, domain name transfers in, and on domain names that have never had privacy turned on before within the system.\nAfter the 1 free year is up you will be charged for the renewal at the current privacy protection price.\nIn the case your privacy protection does not end on the \"anniversary\" of your domain name's expiration (this can happen with transfers for example), NameBright will \"sync\" the privacy protection to the closest anniversary of the expiration date once the free year has ended.\nIn this case you will see a pro-rated charge where privacy might only renew for a few months (for a fraction of the yearly price with the pro-rated price), and then you will see a second privacy charge for an additional year when the anniversary of your domain's expiration comes up.\nThis is done to keep all services associated with a domain synced up with its expiration date to make the management of your domain names easier.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you do not long into your account and manually cancel your 1-year of free privacy protection before the domain name renews, or before the anniversary of the domain, you will be charged the current rate for privacy protection.\n(Currently $2.95 per domain name per year.)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>19.<strong>Registered Name Holder Representations and Warranties</strong>.\nYou represent that all information you provide and submit to NameBright.com is
