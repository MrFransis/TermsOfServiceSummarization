following restrictions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License.\nYou must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\nYou may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.\nYou may not sublicense the Work.\nYou must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\nWhen You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.\nThis Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.\nIf You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\nIf You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.</li>\n<li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the terms of: (i) this License.\n(ii) a later version of this License with the same License Elements as this License.\n(iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)).\n(iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License.\nIf you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license.\nIf you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\n(II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.\n(III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\n(IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.\nThis Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.</li>\n<li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties.\n(ii) the title of the Work if supplied.\n(iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.\nand (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\").\nThe credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner.\nprovided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</li>\n<li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\nLicensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.\nJapan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nRepresentations, Warranties and

YOU.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nLimitation on Liability.</strong> EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nTermination</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\nIndividuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\nSections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.</li>\n<li>Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\nNotwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time.\nprovided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nMiscellaneous</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each time You

to You under this License.</li>\n<li>If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</li>\n<li>No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.</li>\n<li>This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.\nThere are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.\nLicensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.\nThis License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.</li>\n<li>The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\nThese rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.\nIf the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License.\nthis License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.</li>\n</ol> ODC Open Database License (ODbL) Preamble <p>The Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to\nallow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while\nmaintaining this same freedom for others.\nMany databases are covered by\ncopyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights.\nSome\njurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that\ncover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too.\nFinally,\nthe ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to\nact in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.</p>\n<p>Databases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,\naudiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),\nand so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the\ncontents of the Database individually.\nLicensors should use the ODbL\ntogether with another license for the contents, if the contents have a\nsingle set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents.\nIf the\ncontents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should\ndescribe what rights govern what contents together in the individual\nrecord or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\ntrade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you

Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation.\nand</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nc.\nKeep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices that refer to this License.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nd.\nIf it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a location (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to look for it.</p>\n<p>4.3 Notice for using output (Contents).\nCreating and Using a Produced\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2.\nHowever, if you\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it\nis available under this License.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\na.\nExample notice.\nThe following text will satisfy notice under Section 4.3:</p>\n<code> Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available here under the Open Database License (ODbL).\n</code>\n<p>DATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a\nhyperlink to the URI of the Database.\n\u201cOpen Database

licenses mentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a Derivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nc.\nDerivative Databases and Produced Works.\nA Derivative Database is Publicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4.\nif a Produced Work created from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nd.\nShare Alike and additional Contents.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, You must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a that are incompatible with the rights granted under this License.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\ne.\nCompatible licenses.\nLicensors may authorise a proxy to determine compatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii.\nIf they do so, the authorised proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a compatible license grants You permission to use the compatible license.</p>\n<p>4.5 Limits of Share Alike.\nThe requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply\nin the following:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\na.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license Collective Databases under this License if You incorporate this Database or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License still applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of the Collective Database;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.\nUsing this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as part of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not create a Derivative Database for purposes of Section 4.4.\nand</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nc.\nUse of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements of Section 4.4.</p>\n<p>4.6 Access to Derivative Databases.\nIf You Publicly Use a Derivative\nDatabase or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also\noffer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy\nin a machine readable form of:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\na.\nThe entire Derivative Database.\nor</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.\nA file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or the method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an algorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the differences between the Database and the Derivative Database.</p>\n<p>The Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be\navailable at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical\ndistributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.</p>\n<p>4.7 Technological measures and additional terms</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\na.\nThis License does not allow You to impose (except subject to Section 4.7 b.) any terms or any technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.\nParallel distribution.\nYou may impose terms or technological measures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents (a \u201cRestricted Database\u201d) in contravention of Section 4.74 a.\nonly if You also make a copy of the Database or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the Restricted Database:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\ni.\nThat is available without additional fee;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nii.\nThat is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any rights granted under it,

Database\u201d).\nand</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\niii.\nThe Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the recipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nc.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a Derivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a password, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You do not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights.</p>\n<p>4.8 Licensing of others.\nYou may not sublicense the Database.\nEach time\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the\nContents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same\nterms and conditions as this License.\nYou are not responsible for\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database.\nYou are\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made\nby You or another Person at Your direction.\nYou may not impose any\nfurther restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed\nunder this License.</p> 5.0 Moral

not to assert any moral rights over the Database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.\nand</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nc.\nFor jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under Section 5.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over certain aspects of the Database.</p>\n<p>Please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral\nrights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the Database in some\njurisdictions.</p> 6.0 Fair dealing, Database exceptions, and other rights not affected <p>6.1 This License does not affect any rights that You or anyone else may\nindependently have under any applicable law to make any use of this\nDatabase, including without limitation:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\na.\nExceptions to the Database Right including: Extraction of Contents from

to You.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Persons who have received the\nDatabase, the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, Derivative\nDatabases, or the Database as part of a Collective Database from You\nunder this License will not have their licenses terminated provided\ntheir use is in full compliance with this License or a license granted\nunder Section 4.8 of this License.\nSections 1,
