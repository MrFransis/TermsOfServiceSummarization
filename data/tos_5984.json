App.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, complaints or comments about the App then please contact us at&nbsp;info@upday.com</p>\n<p>If you have any queries about how we use your personal data please

several ways (hereinafter the \u201cApp\u201d).\nThe goal of our App is to aggregate those articles for you, which best correspond to your interests content-wise:</p>\n<p>The selection of the content to be aggregated is mainly based on topic preferences actively set by you as well as, in this context, on your use of the App.\nIf, for example, you are interested in the topic of \u201csports\u201d, you will be able to select this topic in order to later receive articles regarding this topic in aggregated form.\nIf specific, content-related centres of interest can be derived from your use of the App in the course of time, for example, if you particularly read a great deal of articles regarding the topic \u201cscience\u201d, the App will automatically aggregate an increased number of articles for you regarding this topic.</p>\n<p>Aside from the determined or derived preferences described above, the App also offers you an aggregation of news content which is of general relevance (current events or the like).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we will aggregate specific articles for you, which we ourselves have selected.\nAll aggregated articles will be presented with a headline, a short summary as well as with a possible selection of images.\nIf you click on one of these representations the article will be shown to you in full and in unchanged form in the app, however, this article will be delivered directly from the source website.\nFor this purpose the App has a browser function, which shows the web content of the provider of the article.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to change, modify, substitute or remove without notice any information on the App from time to time.</p>\n<p>The legal provisions for the download of the App or the activation of the preinstalled service on the

apps including all subpages, content, and features available on these platforms (e.g.\ninternet forums and contests).\nSeveral parts of upday are also referred to as \u201conline services\u201d.\nThis also applies when we mention the website or, as the case may be, the app.\nOur services are intended for the general public and not for children.\nWe do not knowingly collect any personal data from users who are classified as children by national legislature.</p>\n<p>3.\nProcessed Data Categories</p>\n<p>As soon as you use upday, our system will automatically collect information from your computer system.\nThe data which may be collected during this process is, among others: - Information on the browser type and version - The operation system used - Mobile device ID - Date and time of access - Web analytics data / pseudonym user profile (Cookie ID, Ad ID etc.) - Websites that brought the user to our website - Websites visited by the user from our website.<br>In addition, we process the following personal data in case a contractual relationship between you and us exists, or when you have otherwise forwarded the data to us: - Login information with password</p>\n<p>4.\nLegitimate Basis and Processing Purposes</p>\n<p>We process your data exclusively on the basis of one or more of the applicable legal regulations.\nPursuant to GDPR, personal data can be processed on the basis of a contract or on the implementation of pre-contractual measures\u2014subject to compliance\u2014on the basis of legitimate interests or a law, and for the protection of essential or public interests.\nRegistration is required in order for us to provide certain content or services on our website.\nEvery user can register themselves for free at upday by specifying their first name, last name, email address, and a password, after which your registration data is sent to us.\nThe collection and processing of this data is carried out in line with the licence agreement between us and the user, Art.\n6, \u00a7 1 b GDPR.\nWe\u2019ll also use the email address we collected in the course of your registration or in the context of contract management, to inform you about similar products or services as well as previously existing subscriptions or general information on upday.\nIn this case, email address processing is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interests in requests for our products and services (Art.\n6, \u00a7 1 f GDPR).\nIn addition, we use your email address to send you our newsletter, if you\u2019ve clearly indicated your agreement to receiving newsletter content or, as the case may be, publicity.\nTo this effect we process your email address in order to send you the newsletter, as requested (Art.\n6, \u00a7 1 f GDPR).\nYou can always object, either in writing or per email, to the usage of your email address for such purposes taking effect in the future: 65, Axel-Springer-Str., Berlin, 10888, privacy@upday.com.\nNo costs will be charged other than the transmission costs according to the base rate.\nOn the Internet, every device needs to have a clear address for the transferral of data.\nThis is called the IP address.\nPreliminary storage of the IP address is technically required in order to transfer the website to the computer of the user.\nIn doing so, we abridge IP addresses before processing, thus, any later processing will take place anonymised.\nAny further storage or processing related to the unabridged IP addresses will not take effect.\nIn addition, our servers save your IP address for 14 days for the purpose of your safety.\nDuring processing operations, which are determined by one or several of the previously mentioned legislative bases, processing will take place when it\u2019s necessary for the purpose of preserving legitimate interests, unless these legitimate interests are overridden on the basis of a comprehensive weighing of your interests, and your fundamental rights and freedoms (Art.\n6, \u00a7 1 f GDPR).\nA legitimate interest can be assumed when the person concerned is a customer of the controller.\nThe processing of personal data and our legitimate interest therein and, in particular, the execution of our business operations, shall be in favour of the welfare of our employees and our shareholders.\nOur legitimate interest in offering you custom products, informing you on our products, improvements, and quality features, as well as continuing to improve our services and products, through which we\u2019re also able to increase our sales, is the legal basis for the purpose of Big Data processing, online behavioural advertising, web/app analysis, and advertisement ranking (gathering different selection criteria for suitable advertising).\nFor more detail on web analytics services see section 8.\nYou can object to data processing on the basis of legitimate interests at any time (see section 12).\nIn case the data is processed for any other purpose than as determined by data collection, a compatibility assessment will be carried out (see Art.\n6, \u00a7 4 GDPR).\nSubsequent processing is only permitted if the original purpose is compatible with the new purpose, or when allowed by reason of a special legal basis.\nRecognised compatible purposes are, among others, enforcement, exercising or defence of claims subject to civil law, insofar as no overriding interest of the person concerned exists.\nWe will inform you in case of a change in purpose.\nA new data collection will take place on the grounds of a new legal basis if the new purpose is incompatible with the purpose as determined by data collection.\nWe will inform you on the change in purpose, should this be the case.</p>\n<p>5.\nData Processing Location</p>\n<p>We will not transfer your personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) except when, in certain cases, it is permitted by the GDPR.\nWhether or not third parties with whom you have a contractual relationship (e.g.\nFacebook, if you have a Facebook account) transfer data to countries outside of the European Economic Area is not something we have any knowledge of, nor something we\u2019re able to influence.\nWe also process data in countries outside of the European Economic Area.\nTo guarantee the protection of your personal rights, also in the context of these particular data transfers, we make sure to handle the contractual relationships with recipients in third party countries in compliance with the arrangement of standard contract clauses of the EU commission, corresponding to Art.\n46 \u00a7 2 C, GDPR.\nThese are available at all times via the following link: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:039:0005:0018:EN:PDF.\nAlternatively, you can request the documents using the contact information below.\nWith the launch of the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield on 12/07/2016, the European Commission decided that, in view of these regulations, an appropriate level of personal data protection exists (adequacy decision, Art.\n45, GDPR).\nFurther information\u2014also on certification of the service provider we deployed\u2014you can find on https://www.privacyshield.gov.\nWe only use US service providers who are certified according to the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield.</p>\n<p>6.\nAnalysis Services</p>\n<p>In certain cases we also collect data because you provided your consent in the transferral of the data to us.\nAs you will know, apps are provided for download on third party websites on a regular basis (such as iTunes, Google, etc.).\nWhen, according to the applicable terms of use, one of those upday GmbH &amp.\nCo.\nKG providers becomes your contractual partner for the acquisition of the app, we will process the data allocated to us by the third party provider, the volume of which will be determined by the contractual agreement, so that you can download the app to your mobile end device.</p>\n<p>References for the use of the apps&nbsp;Our app makes use of the following authorisations, with the purposes listed behind it, so that it can obtain access to certain features of your mobile end device: \u2022 Location \u2013 We require access to your location in order to display regional news.\nThis feature is optional&nbsp;Facebook Connect&nbsp;You can login to upday via a Facebook account.\nFacebook Connect is offered by Facebook Ireland Limited, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland.\nThe usage of Facebook Connect underlies the data protection stipulations and terms of use, as defined by Facebook.\nWhen you decide to register through your Facebook account, you will first be directed to Facebook.\nOnce there, Facebook will ask you to login or to register with Facebook.\nThe request to login will be skipped if you are already logged in to Facebook.\nPlease note that we do not receive any login information during these steps.\nWhen registering through Facebook Connect, your Facebook profile data and the \u201cpublic information\u201d as defined by Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation) from your profile will be transferred to us.\nThis regards data which you have made available to the public or which you have unblocked for the respective application.\n\u201cPublic\u201d in the context of Facebook, means that anybody can see this data, also outside of Facebook.\nThis includes your name, your profile and cover picture, your gender, networks, username (Facebook URL) and user identification number (Facebook ID).\nVice versa, we may also transfer data to your Facebook profile.\nWhen you register with us through Facebook Connect, we will collect and process the data transferred to us for the purpose of your registration.</p>\n<p>7.\nTransferring Your Data to Third Parties</p>\n<p>We only transfer your personal data to third parties when this transfer is required in order to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, and when this takes place with or in collaboration with another provider (e.g.\nin case of co-operations), when we are otherwise legally entitled or required to transfer your data, or when you have given us your consent.\nIn order to provide our services, certain departments within our organisation can be informed of selected pieces of personal data.\nThis includes employees working in bookkeeping, product management, marketing, and IT.\nIn certain cases we also commission and deploy external service providers or connected companies in order to process data as instructed by us.\nWe employ service providers for the purpose of processing.\nThey are bound by strict contractual stipulations which are in compliance with the GDPR.\nThey are not permitted to use your data for any other purposes.\nThe processors provide the following services to us: registration service(s), content recommendation, hosting, customer service, survey and commentary service(s), maintenance and support service(s), and web/app analysis.\nThe data transferral to processors takes place in accordance with Art.\n28, \u00a7 1 GDPR, and alternatively on the basis of our legitimate interests in economic and technical gain with the deployment of specialised contractual processors, Art.\n6 \u00a7 1 f GDPR.\nWe will transfer data to public authorities provided that we\u2019re obliged by law or when this is allowed for reasons of data protection, for instance the police or the department of public prosecution (Art.\n6, \u00a7 1 c GDPR).\nThis data transferral is for the purpose of our legitimate interests in fighting abuse, the prosecution of criminal offence, and the protection, enforcement, and execution of claims, as long as these are not overridden by your interest in, and fundamental right to, protection of your personal data, Art.\n6 \u00a7 1 f GDPR.<br>Deactivate Localytics<br>Activate Localytics<br>\n</p>\n<p>8.\nWeb/App Analysis Services</p>\n<p>We deploy services which collect and interpret data for us from the website and the app in order to continuously improve and update our content in line with users\u2019 interests, in addition to displaying behavioural online advertising.\nIn case these service providers aren\u2019t data controllers themselves, as defined by data protection regulations, they will always process the pseudonymised user data as bound by instructions based on a contractual processing agreement.\nYou can deactivate future individual analysis services at any time.\nBelow you can learn in more detail about the analysis services deployed by us:</p>\n<p>AppNexus&nbsp;We use AppNexus to help us display behavioural advertising.\nAppNexus is an advertising service provider and a mediation platform operator (AppNexus, 28 W.\n23rd Street, New York, New York, 10010, USA).\nAppNexus collects and stores information about your activity, which enables the analysis of your user behaviour.\nThese profiles are used to display advertising which specifically reflects your interests.\nShould you not want this, you may deactivate behavioural advertising here: https://www.appnexus.com/en/company/platform-privacy-policy.</p>\n<p>Turn off personalised advertising<br>Turn on personalised advertising</p>\n<p>Crashlytics&nbsp;Crashlytics is an analysis tool which is offered and run by Crashlytics Inc., based in Cambridge MA, USA.\nCrashlytics produces so-called crash reports.\nCrash reports outline operational dysfunctions or malfunctions of the app, they outline when and in what context the malfunctions occurred, how many users were affected, etc.\nWe use these reports to learn about operational dysfunctions or malfunctions and in order to, in the interest of our users, react in a faster, more goal orientated and efficient manner, and to technically improve the app.\nFor this purpose, Crashlytics, in conjunction with your upday app ID\u2014which you can remove at any time\u2014, records data in relation to the crash and general data on the IT environment (in particular the end device used, the mobile network operator, and the operating system).\nAny personal or pseudonymous data will be deleted by Crahslytics after no more than seven days.\nThis information tells Crashlytics, and subsequently us, if and how the app functions and is used, including, in particular, any operational dysfunctions or malfunctions.\nMore information on the privacy policy applied by Crashlytics is available here: https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf.</p>\n<p>Google AdSense&nbsp;<br>We integrated Google AdSense on this website.\nGoogle Adsense is an online service which enables us to advertise on third party websites.\nGoogle Adsense is based on algorithms that select advertisements displayed on third party websites which are suited to the respective websites\u2019 content.\nGoogle AdSense allows interest-based targeting of the internet user, which is converted by generating individual user profiles.\nThe operating company of Google AdSense component is Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.\nThe goal of the Google AdSense component is the integration of advertisements on our website.\nGoogle AdSense places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned.\nThrough placing cookies, Alphabet Inc.\nis able to analyse our website usage.\nEach time one of the pages of our website into which a Google AdSense component is incorporated, is accessed, the internet browser on the IT system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Google AdSense component, to transfer data to Alphabet Inc for the purpose of online advertising and to calculate the respective commission fees.\nIn the context of this technical procedure, Alphabet Inc.\nacquires knowledge on personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, which enables Alphabet Inc.\nto trace the origin and the clicks of the visitor, and subsequently calculate the according commission fees.\nThe person concerned can, at any time, permanently prohibit the placement of cookies by our website, as explained above, by adjusting internet browser settings.\nIn addition, the adjusted internet browser settings would also prohibit Alphabet Inc.\nto place a cookie on the IT system of the person concerned.\nFurthermore, any cookies which were previously placed by Alphabet Inc.\ncan, at any time, be deleted via the internet browser or other software programmes.\nGoogle AdSense uses so-called web beacons.\nA web beacon is a miniature graphic image which is incorporated into a website to enable the creation of a log file record and a log file analysis, which in turn serves to conduct statistical analysis.\nAlphabet Inc.\ncan, by means of the incorporated web beacon, record if and when a website has been accessed by a person concerned and which links the person concerned clicked on.\nWeb beacons help to, among other things, determine the visitor flow of a website.\nVia Google AdSense, personal data and information including the IP address, which is necessary to select the displayed advertisement and determine the according commission fees, are transferred to Alphabet Inc.\nin the United States of America.\nThe personal data are stored and processed in the United States of America.\nUnder certain circumstances, Alphabet Inc.\nwill transfer the personal data, which was collected by means of the described technical procedures, to third parties.\nGoogle AdSense is explained in more detail here: https://www.google.co.uk/intl/de/adsense/start/.</p>\n<p>Google AdWords&nbsp;<br>We integrated AdWords into this website.\nGoogle AdWords is an internet advertising service which allows advertisers to include ads in Google search engine results as well as in Google advertising networks.\nGoogle AdWords enables advertisers to determine certain keywords in advance, by means of which an ad in the Google search engine results will be shown in case the user\u2019s search results are relevant in relation to these keywords.\nIn the Google advertising network, ads are distributed across websites

View, CA 94043-1351, USA.\nThe goal of Google Adwords is to publicise our website through placing interest-based advertising on the websites of third parties and in Google search engine results, in addition to placing third party ads on our website.\nGoogle will place a so-called Conversion Cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned, should the person concerned have accessed our website via a Google ad.\nA conversion cookie will lose its validity after thirty days and is not used to identify the person concerned.\nBy means of the conversion cookie, provided that the cookie is still valid, it will be determined if any subpages or, for example, the shopping basket of an online shop system on our website, have been accessed.\nThe conversion cookie helps us, and Google, to determine if a person concerned that ended up on our website via an AdWords ad, has generated sales in terms of completing or cancelling the purchase of product(s).\nThe data and information collected through the application of a conversion cookie is used by Google to create visitor statistics for our website.\nThese visitor statistics are in turn used by us, to determine the total number of users which were brought to us via AdWords ads.\nThat is to say, to determine the success or the failure of the respective AdWords ads and to optimise our future AdWords ads.\nNeither our company nor any other Google AdWords clients receive information from Google which can be used to identify the person concerned.\nPersonal information is stored by means of the conversion cookie, for instance the websites visited by the person concerned.\nPersonal data, which includes the IP address and the internet connection used by the person concerned, is stored during each visit to our website and transferred to Google in the United States of America.\nGoogle in the United States of America stores this personal data.\nUnder certain circumstances Google will transfer the personal data collected by means of the described technical procedures, to third parties.\nThe person concerned can, at any time, permanently prohibit the placement of cookies by our website, as explained above, by adjusting the internet browser settings.\nIn addition, the adjusted internet browser settings would also prohibit Google to place a conversion cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned.\nFurthermore, any cookies which were previously placed by Google AdWords can, at any time, be deleted via the internet browser or other software programmes.\nFurthermore, the person concerned can object to the interest-based advertising placed by Google.\nIn order to do this, the person concerned must access the following page: https://adssettings.google.co.uk , in each internet browser used and implement the desired adjustments.\nPlease go to the following page for further information and to read about the data protection policies applied by Google:

Analysis service.\nWeb analysis is the collection, storing, and analysation of behavioural data of visitors to our website.\nA web analysation service determines, among other things, which website brought a person concerned to the current website (the so-called referrer), which subpages have been accessed on the website, or how often and for how long a subpage was visited.\nWeb analysis is predominantly used to optimise a website and for a cost-benefit analysis of internet advertising.\nThe operating company of Google Analytics Component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.\nWe use the extension \u201c_gat._anonymizeIp\u201d, for web analysis via Google Analytics.\nWith the use of this extension, Google abridges and anonymises the IP address of the person concerned\u00b4s internet connection when our website is accessed from a Member State of the European Union or another contractual state within the European Economic Area.\nThe goal of the Google Analytics component is the analysis of the visitor flow on our website.\nGoogle uses the acquired data and information to evaluate the usage of our website, among other things, and to create online reports which illustrate the activity on our websites, and to fulfil other services connected to our website.\nGoogle Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the person concerned.\nCookies have already been explained above.\nThe placement of cookies allows Google to analyse the usage of our website.\nEach time one of the pages of our website, into which a Google Analytics component is incorporated, is accessed, the internet browser on the IT system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective Google Analytics component, to transfer data to Google for the purpose of online analysis.\nIn the context of this technical procedure, Google acquires knowledge on personal data, such as the IP address of the person concerned, through which Google can trace the origin and the clicks of the visitor, and subsequently calculate the according commission fees.\nCookies store personal data, for instance the time and the place of access, and the amount of visits to our website by the person concerned.\nFor each visit to our website, the respective personal data, which includes the IP address and the internet connection used by the person concerned, is transferred to Google in the United States of America.\nGoogle in the United States of America stores this personal data.\nUnder certain circumstances, Google will transfer the personal data collected through these technical procedures to third parties.\nThe person concerned can, at any time, permanently prohibit the placement of cookies by our website, as explained above, by adjusting the internet browser settings.\nIn addition, the adjusted internet browser settings would also prohibit Google to place a cookie on the IT system of the person concerned.\nFurthermore, any cookies which were previously placed by Google Analytics can, at any time, be deleted via the internet browser or other software programmes.\nFurthermore, the person concerned has the option to dissent with and prohibit the collection and the processing of usage-based data in relation to this website by Google Analytics.\nIn order to do this, the person concerned has to download and install a browser add-on via the following link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.\nThis browser add-on informs Google Analytics via JavaScript, that no data nor any information regarding website visits may be shared with Google Analytics.\nGoogle considers the installing the browser add-on as an objection.\nIf the information system of the person concerned is deleted, formatted, or newly installed at a later stage, the person concerned will have to reinstall the browser add-on in order to deactivate Google Analytics.\nIn case the browser add-on is uninstalled or deactivated by the person concerned, or a person authorised by the person concerned, there is the possibility of renewed installation or activation of the browser add-ons.\nFor more information and to learn about the data protection policies applied by Google, please go to the following pages: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en and

company of Google DoubleClick is Google Inc., Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, USA.\nEach time the website is accessed, and also for clicks and other activities, Google DoubleClick transfers data to the DoubleClick server.\nEach data transferral prompts a cookie request for the browser of the person concerned.\nWhen the browser accepts the request, DoubleClick will place a cookie on the IT system of the person concerned.\nCookies have already been explained above.\nThe goal of cookies is to optimize and implement advertising.\nThe cookie is used, among other things, to place and display advertisements as well as to create or improve advertising campaigns.\nIn addition, the cookie helps to avoid multiple placements of the same advertising.\nDoubleClick uses a cookie ID, which is necessary to carry out technical procedures.\nThe cookie ID is used, for instance, to display an advertisement in a browser.\nThe cookie also helps DoubleClick to determine which advertisements have already been implemented into a browser, this in turn prevents repetition of the advertisement.\nMoreover, the cookie enables DoubleClick to create conversions.\nA conversion has taken place when a user clicks on a DoubleClick advertisement and subsequently, in the same browser, completes a purchase on the website of the advertiser.\nA DoubleClick cookie does not collect personal data.\nA DoubleClick cookie can, however, collect additional campaign identification.\nCampaign identification refers to the identification of a campaign with which the user has previously been connected.\nEach time one of the pages of our website into which a DoubleClick component has been incorporated, is accessed, the internet browser on the IT system of the person concerned is automatically prompted by the respective DoubleClick component, to transfer data to Google for the purpose of online advertising and to calculate the respective commission fees.\nBy means of this technical procedure, Google acquires knowledge on data through which Google can calculate the according commission fees.\nGoogle can retrace, among other things, when the person concerned clicked on certain links on our website.\nThe person concerned can, at any time, permanently prohibit the placement of cookies by our website, as explained above, by adjusting the internet browser settings.\nIn addition, the adjusted internet browser settings would also prohibit Google to place a cookie on the IT system of the person concerned.\nFurthermore, any cookies which were previously placed by Google can, at any time, be deleted via the internet browser or other software programmes.\nPlease go to the following pages for further information and to learn about the data protection policies applied by

embed-code is HMTL code which has been integrated by the website operator into a website.\nBy default, if a website operator integrated an embed code, the external content of the other website will be displayed as soon as a website is visited.\nIn order to display the third party content, the external content is loaded directly from the other website.\nGetty Images provides more information on content embedding here: https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/resources/embed.\nThrough the implementation of the embed code, which enables the display of Getty Images material, the IP address of internet connection via which the person concerned connects to our website is transferred to Getty Images.\nGetty Images collects the used browser type, the browser language, and the time and the duration of
