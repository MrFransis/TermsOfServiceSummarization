Agent<br> 61 South Fair Oaks Avenue, Suite 200<br> Pasadena, CA 91105<br> Email: dmca@supplyframe.com</p> 10.\nGeneral <p>\n</p>10.1 Changes to Terms of Use.\nThis Agreement is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any) and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Services.\nAny changes to this agreement will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Services.\nThese changes will be effective immediately for new Users of our Services.\nYou are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address.\nIn the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.\nContinued use of our Services following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>10.2 Dispute Resolution.\nPLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY.\nIT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>(a) Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action (including the interpretation and scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, count, claim, or cause of action) between you and Supply Frame and our employees, contractors, agents, successors, or assigns, regarding or relating to the Services or this Agreement, shall exclusively be settled through binding and confidential arbitration.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>(b) Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<b>AAA</b>\u201d) or JAMS.\nAs modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA\u2019s or JAMS\u2019s rules for commercial arbitration and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the procedures for consumer-related disputes.<p>\n</p>\n<p>You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court.\nYour rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.\nYou are entitled to a <u>FAIR HEARING</u>, BUT the arbitration procedures are <u>SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED</u> THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.\nArbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to <u>VERY LIMITED REVIEW</u> BY A COURT.</p>\n<p>You and we must abide by the following rules:<b> (1)</b> ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND <u>NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER</u> IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\n<b>(2)</b> THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF, <b>(3)</b> in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, <b>(4)</b> we also reserve the right in our sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration.\n<b>(5)</b> the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law.\n<b>(6)</b> the arbitrator\u2019s award shall be final and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n<b>(7)</b> the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law.\nand <b>(8)</b> each side pays its own attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees\u2019 and litigation expenses, and then in such instance, the fees and costs awarded shall be determined by the applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n</p>(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or we may bring an individual action in small claims court.\nFurther, claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.\nSuch claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California.\nAdditionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in Los Angeles County, California in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Los Angeles County, California for such purpose.\nA request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>(d) With the exception of subparts (1) and (2) in the paragraph 10.2(b) above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Agreement, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\nIf, however, either subparts (1) and (2) in the paragraph 10.2(b) (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitration.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court in Los Angeles County, California.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>(e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if we seek to terminate the Dispute Resolution section as included in the Agreement, any such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of the Agreement not containing the agreement to arbitrate is posted to the Services, and shall not be effective as to any claim of which you provided us with written notice prior to the date of termination.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>(f) For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at http://www.adr.org.\nFor more information on JAMS, it\u2019s Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call JAMS at 800-352-5267 or visit the JAMS website at http://www.jamsadr.com.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>(g) Any and all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and Supply Frame and our employees, agents, successors, or assigns, regarding or relating to the Services or this Agreement, shall exclusively be governed by the internal laws of the State of California, without regard to its choice of law rules and without regard to conflicts of laws principles except that the arbitration provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>10.3 Miscellaneous.\nThis Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Services.\nOur failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\nThe section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nThe word including means including without limitation.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nEach User\u2019s relationship to Supply Frame is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.\nThis Agreement, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without our prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.\nThe terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>10.4 Electronic

Information as described in this Privacy Policy from users of the SupplyFrame Offerings (\u201c<strong>Users</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>\n<p>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS

OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY CONSENTING TO SUCH PROCESSING.</p> General Information <p>As a general principle, your granting of any consent and your provision of any Personal Information hereunder is entirely voluntary.\nthere are generally no detrimental effects on you if you choose not to consent or to provide Personal Information.\nHowever, there are circumstances in which SupplyFrame cannot take action without certain Personal Information, for example because this Personal Information is required to process your orders or provide you with access to a web offering or newsletter.\nIn these cases, it will unfortunately not be possible for SupplyFrame to provide you with what you request without the relevant Personal Information.</p>\n<p>As part of a global group of companies, SupplyFrame has affiliates and third-party service providers within, as well as outside of, the European Economic Area (the \u201c<strong>EEA</strong>\u201d).\nAs a consequence, whenever SupplyFrame is using or otherwise processing your Personal Information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement, SupplyFrame may transfer your Personal Information to countries outside of the EEA including to such countries in which a statutory level of data protection applies that is not comparable to the level of data protection within the EEA.\nWhenever such transfer occurs, it is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC or any future replacement) in order to contractually provide that your Personal Information is subject to a level of data protection that applies within the EEA.</p>\n<p>You can request from SupplyFrame at any time details about which Personal Information SupplyFrame processes about you and the correction or deletion of such Personal Information.\nPlease note, however, that SupplyFrame can delete your Personal Information only if there is no statutory obligation or prevailing right of SupplyFrame to retain it.\nIf you request that SupplyFrame delete your Personal Information, you will not be able to continue to use any SupplyFrame service that requires SupplyFrame\u2019s use of your Personal Information.</p>\n<p>If SupplyFrame uses your Personal Information based on your consent or to perform a contract with you, you may further request from SupplyFrame a copy of the Personal Information that you have provided to SupplyFrame.\nIn this case, please contact the email address below and specify the information or processing activities to which your request relates, the format in which you would like this information, and whether the Personal Information is to be sent to you or another recipient.\nSuppyFrame will carefully consider your request and discuss with you how we can best fulfill it.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, you can request from SupplyFrame that we restrict your Personal Information from any further processing in any of the following events: (i) you state that the Personal Information SupplyFrame has about you is incorrect, (but only for as long as SupplyFrame requires to check the accuracy of the relevant Personal Information), (ii) there is no legal basis for SupplyFrame processing your Personal Information and you demand that SupplyFrame restricts your Personal Information from further processing, (iii) SupplyFrame no longer requires your Personal Information but you claim that you require SupplyFrame to retain such data in order to claim or exercise legal rights or to defend against third party claims, or (iv) in case you object to the processing of your Personal Information by SupplyFrame (based on SupplyFrame\u2019s legitimate interest as further set out below) for as long as it is required to review as to whether SupplyFrame has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your Personal Information.</p>\n<p>Please direct any such request to privacy@supplyframe.com.</p> Right To Lodge A Complaint <p>If you believe that SupplyFrame is not processing your Personal Information in accordance with the requirements set out herein or applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection authority of the EEA country in which you live or with the data protection authority of the country or state in which SupplyFrame has its registered seat.</p> Data Controller <p>The data controller of www.supplyframe.com is Supply Frame, Inc., 61 S.\nFair Oaks Avenue, Suite 200, Pasadena California, USA

required to take measures to prevent entities, organizations, and parties listed on government-issued sanctioned-party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and services through

information.\n(iii) blocking of access to SupplyFrame\u2019s services and systems in case of a potential match.\nand (iv) contacting a user to confirm his or her identity in case of a potential

between members of SupplyFrame as required to ensure compliance.</p> Uses Of My Personal Information Based On My Consent <p>In the following cases SupplyFrame will only use your Personal Information as further detailed below after you have granted your prior consent into the relevant processing operations.</p>\n<p>SupplyFrame may provide a hashed user ID to third party operated social networks or other web offerings (such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram or Google) where this information is then matched against the social networks\u2019 data or the web offerings\u2019 own data bases in order to display to you more relevant information.</p>\n<p>SupplyFrame offers you the option to use its Offerings including forums, blogs, and networks linked to its Sites that require you to register and create a user profile.\nUser profiles provide the option to display personal information about you to other users, including but not limited to your name, photo, social media accounts, postal or email address, or both, telephone number, personal interests, skills, and basic information about your company.</p>\n<p>These profiles may relate to a single Offering of SupplyFrame or may also allow you to access other Offerings of SupplyFrame or of other entities of SupplyFrame, or both (irrespective of any consent granted under the section \u201cForwarding Your Personal Data To Other SupplyFrame Companies.\u201d below).\nIt is, however, always your choice which of these additional Offerings you use and your Personal Information is only forwarded to them once you initially access them.\nKindly note that without your consent for SupplyFrame to create such user profiles, SupplyFrame will not be in a position to offer such services to you where your consent is a statutory requirement that SupplyFrame can provide these services to you.</p>\n<p>Within any Offerings, beyond the mere provision of access, your profile is used to personalize interaction with other users (for example, by way of messaging or follow functionality) and by SupplyFrame to foster the quality of communication and collaboration through such Offerings and for SupplyFrame to provide gamification elements (gamification is the process of taking something that already exists, such as a website, an enterprise application, or an online community, and integrating game mechanics into it to motivate participation, engagement, and loyalty).\nTo the greatest extent supported by the relevant Offerings, you can use the functionality of the relevant Offerings to determine which information you want to share.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Special categories of Personal Information.</em> In connection with the registration for and provision of access to an event or seminar, SupplyFrame may ask for information about your health for the purpose of identifying and being considerate of individuals who have disabilities or special dietary requirements throughout the event.\nAny such use of information is based on the consent you grant hereunder.</p>\n<p>Kindly note that if you do not provide any such information about disabilities or special dietary requirements, SupplyFrame will not be able to take any respective precautions.</p>\n<p>If you register for an event, seminar, or webinar of SupplyFrame, SupplyFrame may share basic participant information (your name, company, and email address) with other participants of the same event, seminar, or webinar for the purpose of communication and the exchange of ideas.</p>\n<p>SupplyFrame may transfer your Personal Information to other entities owned by SupplyFrame.\nIn such cases, these entities will then use the Personal Information for the same purposes and under the same conditions as outlined in this section.</p>\n<p>You may at any time withdraw a consent granted.\nIn case of withdrawal, SupplyFrame will not process Personal Information subject to this consent any longer unless legally required to do so.\nIn case SupplyFrame is required to retain your Personal Information for legal reasons your Personal Information will be restricted from further processing and only retained for the term required by law.\nHowever, any withdrawal has no effect on past processing of Personal Information by SupplyFrame up to the point in time of your withdrawal.\nFurthermore, if your use of an SupplyFrame Offering requires your prior consent, SupplyFrame will not be (any longer) able to provide the relevant service, offer or event to you after your revocation.</p> U.S.-Specific Provisions <p>Where SupplyFrame is subject to U.S.\nprivacy

personal information to professional advisors, such as lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers (<strong>\u201cProfessional Advisors\u201d</strong>), where necessary in the course of the professional services that they render to us.</p>\n<p>We may (and you authorize us to) disclose information we have collected from and about you (including Personal Information) if we believe in good faith that

and share Personal Information of California residents in operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal Information.&nbsp.\nFor purposes of this section, \u201c<strong>Personal Information</strong>\u201d has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201c<strong>CCPA</strong>\u201d) but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your California privacy rights.\n</strong>As a California resident, you have the rights listed below.\nHowever, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Information.</strong>&nbsp.\nYou can request the following information about how we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past 12 months:<ul>\n<li>The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.</li>\n<li>The categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information.</li>\n<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling Personal Information.</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal Information.</li>\n<li>The categories of Personal Information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose.</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties to whom the Personal Information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Access</strong>.&nbsp.\nYou can request a copy of the Personal Information that we have collected about you during the past 12 months.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deletion.&nbsp.\n</strong>You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that we have collected from you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt-out of sales.&nbsp.\n</strong>If we sell your Personal Information, you can opt-out.\nIn addition, if you direct us not to sell your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California\u2019s \u201cShine the Light\u201d law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Nondiscrimination.</strong>&nbsp.\nYou are entitled to exercise the rights described above free from discrimination as prohibited by the CCPA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul> How to exercise your rights <p>You may exercise your California privacy rights described above as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to information, access and deletion.\n</strong>You can request to exercise your information, access and deletion rights

opt-out of the \u201csale\u201d of your Personal Information.&nbsp.\n</strong>We do not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money).&nbsp.\nHowever, like many companies, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you.&nbsp.\nCalifornia law classifies our use of these services as a \u201csale\u201d of your Personal Information to the companies that provide the services.\nThis is because we allow them to collect information from our website users (e.g., online identifiers and browsing activity) so they can help serve ads more likely to interest you.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;You can request to opt-out out of this \u201csale\u201d of your personal information here: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.</p>\n<p>We will need
