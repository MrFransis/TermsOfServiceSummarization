thereof, are not an indication of your health, nor are those notifications or suggested actions intended to replace the opinion of your physician.\nIt is your responsibility to present your data to your physician, and to discuss with your physician what the proper course of action is based on your medical history.\nAliveCor may also allow you to schedule reminder notices using the AliveCor

located in the EU, such jurisdiction of the Santa Clara County courts will be non-exclusive.\nWe operate the AliveCor Service from our offices in the United States, and we make no representation that Materials included in the AliveCor Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>General</strong>.\nThese Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and

CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU MAY SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Generally</strong>.\nTo the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and in the interest of resolving disputes between you and AliveCor in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and AliveCor agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration, unless you are a consumer located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the exclusive use of arbitration for dispute resolution.</p>\n<p>Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nThis agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ALIVECOR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Opt-Out of Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting support@alivecor.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name, and email address used to register for the AliveCor Service) decline this arbitration agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Exceptions</strong>.\nDespite the provisions of Section 24A, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.\n(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.\n(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law.\nor (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitrator</strong>.\nTo the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any arbitration between you and AliveCor will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201d) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting AliveCor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Notice.\nProcess</strong>.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.\nMail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (\u201c<strong>Notice</strong>\u201d).\nAliveCor\u2019s address for Notice is: AliveCor, Inc., 444 Castro Street, Suite 600 Mountain View, CA 94041 USA.\nThe Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201d).\nThe parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or AliveCor may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or AliveCor must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIf the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, AliveCor will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any.\n(ii) the last written settlement amount offered by AliveCor in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nor (iii) $1,000.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Fees</strong>.\nIf you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, AliveCor will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place at a location, to be agreed upon, in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.\nor (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse AliveCor for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>No Class Actions</strong>.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND ALIVECOR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and AliveCor agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Claims</strong>.\nTo the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, no action arising out of, in connection with, or relating to these Terms shall be brought by you more than one (1) year after the accrual of the cause of action.\nThis period shall not be extended for any reason, except by the written consent of both parties.\nAll statutes or provisions of law which would toll or otherwise affect the running of the period of limitation are hereby waived, and no such statute or provision of law shall operate to extend the period limited in this paragraph, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision</strong>.\nIf AliveCor makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to AliveCor\u2019s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to AliveCor\u2019s address for Notice, in which case your account with AliveCor will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Enforceability</strong>.\nIf Section 24G is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 24 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 24 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 22 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Notices.\nConsent to Electronic Communications</strong>.\nBy using the AliveCor Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in the Privacy Policy.\nPlease read the Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices.\nYou agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.\nAll notices from AliveCor intended for receipt by You shall be deemed delivered and effective when sent to the email address provided by You during the registration process or when posted to and made available to you on the AliveCor Service.\nIf you change the email address provided in connection with your registration to access and use the AliveCor Service, you must update your address in accordance with the procedures set forth on the AliveCor Service.\nBy providing your mobile number to us, you consent to receive text messages at that number as requested for account verification, message notifications, and other purposes related to the AliveCor Service.\nWhile we do not charge a fee for text messages, your carrier may charge standard messaging, data, and other fees.\nYou are responsible for those charges.\nWe may send and receive text messages through cellular telephone operators or other networks, and the level of reliability may vary.\nWe are not responsible for the timeliness or final delivery of the message, as this is outside our control and is the responsibility of the cellular telephone operator or other networks.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, we will use your mobile number in accordance with the Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>NOTICE REGARDING APPLE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You acknowledge
