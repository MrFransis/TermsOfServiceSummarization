independently collect information about you and may solicit personal information from you.\nFor example, Student Brands maintains its own branded pages on various social networks.\nWhen you visit these branded social media pages, the provider of the social network and other Third-Party Services may set Tracking Technologies on your browser or device.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Social Features.\n<ul>\n<li>Certain functionalities on the Services may permit interactions that you initiate between the Services and certain Third-Party Services, such as third-party social networks (\u201cSocial Features\u201d).\nExamples of Social Features include: enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Services and a Third-Party Services.\n\u201cliking\u201d or

access to may be publicly displayed on the Services (see \u201cInformation You Disclose Publicly or to Others\u201d section above) or by the Third-Party Services that you use.\nSimilarly, if you post information on a third-party service that references the Services (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with Student Brands or its affiliates in a tweet or status update), your post may be used on or in connection with the Services or otherwise by Student Brands and its affiliates.\nAlso, both Student Brands and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Services and any Third-Party Services.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Advertising.\n<ul>\n<li>We may engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Services and/or on Third-Party Services.\nSome of these ads may be tailored to your interest based on your browsing, across time, of the Services and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of data from cross-device usage, sometimes referred to as \u201cinterest-based advertising\u201d and \u201conline behavioral advertising\u201d (\u201cInterest-based Advertising\u201d), which may include sending you an ad on a third-party service after you have left the Services (i.e., \u201cretargeting\u201d).\nOur advertisers' and ad networks' use of Tracking Technologies are governed by their own privacy policies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Your Tracking Technologies Choices.\n<ul>\n<li>Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.\nBrowsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately.\nAlso, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to some Tracking Technologies, such as HTML5 cookies.\nPlease be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</li>\n<li>Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app.\nTo uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.\nApple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.</li>\n<li>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal to online services you visit.\nNote, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what \u201cDo Not Track\u201d means in this context.\nLike many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal from a visitor's browser.\nTo find out more about \u201cDo Not Track,\u201d you can visit https://www.allaboutdnt.com, but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third-party information.\nYou have the right to request information from us about the Services that currently do not respond to \"do not track\" mechanisms featured in any Internet browser by contacting us according to the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section below.</li>\n<li>Many advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's (\u201cDAA\u201d) Self- Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.\nTo learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising for DAA members, visit here and here for information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps.\nSome of these companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d).\nTo learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see here.\nYou can also go to here to adjust your advertising preferences with our service provider, NextRoll, Inc.\n(which used to be called AdRoll), or here to opt out of the use of your data by one of our other service providers, LiveRamp.</li>\n<li>Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.\nOpting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks).\nAlso, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.</li>\n<li>We support the ad industry's 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf) and expect that ad networks that we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guaranty their compliance.\nWe are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</li>\n<li>In addition, we may serve ads on third-party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our databases (\u201cMatched List Ads\u201d).\nThis is done by using Tracking Technologies, or by matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the third-party services.\nWe are not responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data.\nWe are not responsible for such third parties' failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions as they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may change their options without notice to us or you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Analytics.\n<ul>\n<li>We may use Third-Party Services such as Google Analytics and Sailthru to help us analyze our performance and our delivery of services and advertising to you.\nFor example, we may use Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.\n<ul>\n<li>You may exercise your choices regarding the use of cookies by Google Analytics by using the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on or by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/ and following the instructions.</li>\n<li>You may exercise your choices regarding the use of cookies by our other analytics vendor, Sailthru, by going to https://www.sailthru.com/legal/privacy-statement and following the instructions.</li>\n<li>We and third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol> 6.\nOpting Out of Promotional Communications.\n<p>You can make choices about how your information may be used by us to provide information and offers to you.\nYou may opt out of commercial messages by clicking on the \"opt out\" or \"unsubscribe\" link provided with each message.\nThese preferences do not apply to transactional communications, such as those that are related to your registration with us, required or important notices related to your use of our Services, or the fulfillment of a specific transaction.</p> 7.\nOpting Out of Providing Personal Information Through the Apps.\n<p>You may be able to enable or disable certain permissions features (e.g., allowing the App to: read, modify, or delete the contents of your USB storage.\ntake pictures and videos.\nview Wi-Fi connection) by adjusting the permissions in your device.\nIf you no longer want to provide any information to us through the Apps, you may uninstall them from your device.</p> 8.\nAccessing and Changing Information.\n<p>We may provide web page(s), other mechanisms or processes allowing you to delete, correct, or update some of the personal information that we collect from you, and potentially certain other information about you (e.g., profile and account information).\nWe will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then-active databases as soon as practicable, but it is not always possible to completely change, remove or delete all of your information or public postings from our databases and residual and/or cached data may remain archived thereafter.\nFurther, we reserve the right to retain data: (a) as required by applicable law.\nand (b) for so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the data is retained except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>\n<p>California minors should see the \u201cMinors\u201d section below regarding potential removal of certain UGC they have posted on the Services.</p> 9.\nMinors.\n<p>Children under the age

prospective public view or anonymize it so the minor cannot be individually identified to the extent required by applicable law.\nThis removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal.\nFor instance, third parties may have republished or archived content by search engines and others that we do not control.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol> 10.\nLinks and Other Sites.\n<p>This
