that contain a string of characters, such as an anonymous unique browser identifier.\nCookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as (usually unique) tags that identify your device.\nOur servers send your browser or device a cookie when you visit the Site, and Clients and partners may do likewise on their websites or through their multi-site platforms.\nA pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.\nWhen you access these web pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit and permit us to set or read our cookies.\nPixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track activity on a site by a particular device.\nWhen you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect a unique website visit.\nWe (or partners we work with) may use cookies to, among other things, \"remember\u201d you (e.g., when you visit the Site), track user trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients\u2019 sites or interact with advertising.\nWe use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests.\nWe may use the following types of cookies:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Strictly necessary cookies.\nThese are cookies that are required for the operation of our Site.\nThey include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Site, or make use of e-billing services.</li>\n<li>Analytical/performance cookies.\nThese allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Site or our Clients' websites.\nThis helps us and our Clients to improve the way that the websites work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</li>\n<li>Functionality cookies.\nThese are used to recognise you when you return to our Site or our Clients' websites.\nThis means that content can be personalised for you and your preferences can be remembered (for example, your choice of language or region).</li>\n<li>Targeting cookies.\nThese cookies record your visit to our Site or our Clients' websites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.\nThis information will be used to make the websites and the advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests.\nWe may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Disabling Cookies.\nMost Web browsers are set up to accept cookies.\nYou may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies.\nHowever, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the websites you visit may be difficult to use or inoperable.\nFor more information about cookies and how to change your browser settings, please visit www.aboutcookies.org.</li>\n<li>Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.\nWe also sometimes use, or partner with publishers or publisher-facing and app developer platforms that use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services.\nA mobile SDK is in effect the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon.\nThe SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.\nWe may use this technology, for instance, to analyze or measure certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device.\nIf you\u2019d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the below Section titled \"Your Choices, and Your Opt Out Options\" </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes, our Clients or partners we work with may use the above technologies

efficiently analyze online or mobile audiences, or target advertising and analyze ad performance.</p>\n<br> 5.\nYour Choices, and Your Opt Out Options <p>We sometimes work with companies that capture anonymous or de-identified data and create targeting attributes based on users\u2019online browsing activities.\nYou may opt out of these third parties\u2019 services (and learn more about them) by

advertising identifiers from mobile devices.\nYou may opt out of use these identifiers for purposes of interest-based advertising by accessing the settings on your phone.</p>\n<p> Another option you have is to use out opt-out page to generate an optout cookie on your browser.\nWhen this cookie is detected by InsurAds we ensure that no personal information is captured by our system.\nThe cookie is

opt-out preferences page here.\n</p>\n<br> 6.\nThird Parties on InsurAds\u2019s Own Site <p>As on most websites, third parties may directly gather user information from users of our Site through automated means such as cookies or pixels.\nFor example, our third party video hosting provider may use Flash cookies to collect and store information, such as your volume control preferences.\nCookie management tools provided by your browser may help you manage certain types of cookies but may not work with other kinds, such as Flash cookies.\nTo learn how to manage privacy and storage settings

security.\nOf course, no security system is perfect.\nWhile we take a range of measures to safeguard against the unauthorized access to the data we collect and store, we cannot guarantee that it will not be disclosed or accessed inadvertently or through the unauthorized acts of others.</p>\n<br> 8.\nYour Rights <p>If you are a resident of Australia or of a European Union Member State, you have the
