in violation of our Terms of Service.</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>Removal of Material for Which Copyright Infringement Is Claimed</strong>\n<p> We take claims of copyright infringement seriously.\nWe will respond to allegations of copyright violations under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\nThe DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give notice to an online service provider concerning alleged copyright infringement.\nWhen an effective DMCA notice is received, the online service provider responds under this process by taking down the offending content.\nOn taking down content under the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content so that a Counternotification may be filed.\nOn receiving a valid Counternotification, we generally restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from the DMCA Notice provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity.\nOur privacy policy does not protect any information contained in any DMCA Counternotification.</p>\n<strong>To File a DMCA Notification.</strong>\n<strong> If you are a copyright owner or an agent of a copyright owner and belief that any Content infringes on your copyrights, you may submit a notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by providing our copyright

activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.\nProviding URLs in the body of your DMCA notice is the best way to help us locate content quickly.</li>\n<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.</li>\n<li>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>\n<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty
