That\u2019s in part because Google tracks your searches and hides trackers on millions of websites.\nBy contrast, our private search engine doesn\u2019t track your searches and our DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app block Google\u2019s (and many other companies\u2019) trackers across the Internet, helping to keep your browsing history more private, as it should be.\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning \u2014 by using DuckDuckGo you also escape the manipulation of the filter bubble and can use the Internet faster (after all that tracking code is disabled).</p>&nbsp;Learn more.How do DuckDuckGo search results compare to Google\u2019s?<p>DuckDuckGo search gives you truly private search results without tradeoffs in result quality.\nWe have everything you\u2019ve come to expect in an online search experience, and a few bonus features that make searching the Internet not only private, but also a bit more fun! And, on top of that, because there is no search history on DuckDuckGo, you escape the filter bubble of manipulated results.</p>&nbsp;Learn more.What\u2019s the difference between using DuckDuckGo and Incognito mode?<p>It is a myth that you can\u2019t be tracked while using so-called \u201cIncognito\u201d mode.\nIn fact, Incognito mode mainly just deletes information on your computer and does nothing to stop Google from saving your searches, nor does it stop companies, Internet service providers, or governments from being able to track you across the Internet.\nBy contrast, DuckDuckGo search is completely anonymous and if you add our app &amp.\nextension on top, we help keep you private when browsing off of search results.</p>&nbsp;Learn more.How popular is DuckDuckGo?<p>We don\u2019t track our users, so it\u2019s actually impossible for us to know how many users in total are using our products.\nHowever, we are able to make an estimate based on the number of searches we get per month, which we make public.\nOur best guess \u2014 over 50 million people!</p>&nbsp;Learn more.How does the DuckDuckGo app &amp.\nextension work?<p>The DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser mobile app and Privacy Essentials desktop extension both come with our best-in-class tracker blocker, encryption enforcer, and private search engine \u2013 all in one simple package.\nThis gives you all the key privacy protection tools to search and browse privately, curbing the constant monitoring of your Internet activity by companies like Google and Facebook.</p>&nbsp;Learn more.\nAdd DuckDuckGo to Firefox ", "created_at": "2019-03-29 08:57:55.113645", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 21:34:41.076353"}], "points": [{"id": 8387, "title": "This service does not track you", "source": "https://duckduckgo.com", "status": "Generated through the annotate view", "created_at": "2019-11-12 03:26:57.231053", "updated_at": "2020-12-23 19:18:51.33826", "quoteText": "We don\u2019t store your<br>personal information.\nEver.<p>Our privacy policy is simple: we don\u2019t collect<br>or share any of your personal information.</p>", "case_id": 218, "document_id": 1113, "quoteStart": 2199, "quoteEnd": 2348}, {"id": 16826, "title": "This service tracks you on other websites", "source": "https://duckduckgo.com", "status": "Generated through the annotate view", "created_at": "2021-02-24 12:58:46.973994", "updated_at": "2021-05-02 00:00:42.828421", "quoteText": "Extension<p>Protect your data on every device", "case_id": 129, "document_id": 1113, "quoteStart": 49, "quoteEnd": 94}], "urls": ["login.persona.org"]}}
