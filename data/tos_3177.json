reserve the right to disqualify, in our absolute discretion, any users we suspect to be working in a team by voiding all their wins and freezing their accounts.\nNo funds or Bids will be returned or

consisting of a username, password, credit card information, billing address, and other information as may be required by DealDash.\nYou may register only once and may only have one account at DealDash for your personal use.\nAdditionally, each household or \"group of users associated with each other\", determined by the sole discretion of DealDash, may not register or have control over more than two DealDash member accounts.\nIf a single person is found to have or maintain control over several accounts on DealDash, or if a household or a \"group of users associated with each other\" is found to have or maintain control over more than two accounts on DealDash, all accounts will be immediately suspended, all auctions the accounts have participated in will be voided, and any Bids purchased will be removed without prior warning and without any form of compensation.</p>\n<p>During the registration process, the user must choose a username.\nThe username may not offend common decency or infringe upon the rights of third parties.\nThe username may also not be misleading in any way or, in DealDash's judgment, closely resemble the identity of an existing user.\nIt is a condition of your use of the Services that all the information you provide through the Services is correct, current, and complete.\nYou agree to maintain and promptly update your user account information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.\nIf you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, or DealDash has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, DealDash may suspend or terminate your account or access to the Services.\nIf you abuse your user account, whether it harms a third party or DealDash, you may be disqualified and, if applicable, DealDash may notify applicable authorities of the possibility of a crime.</p>\n<p>ACCOUNTS AUTHORIZED TO USE THE SERVICES CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED OR USED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE AUTHORIZED ACCOUNT HOLDER.\nUSE OF THIS ACCOUNT BY A PERSON OR PERSONS NOT AUTHORIZED BY DEALDASH IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.\nNO MORE THAN ONE LOG-IN SESSION OR ONE AUTHORIZED ACCOUNT USER CAN BE ACTIVE AT A TIME FOR ANY ACCOUNT.\nEXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY THE BIDBUDDY SYSTEM, ACCOUNTS WHICH HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED IN WHOLE, PART, OR PROXY BIDDING TO OTHER PARTIES, OR SHOW OTHER ACTIVITY IN VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS, ARE SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE TERMINATION.\nDEALDASH RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN LOGS OF ACCOUNT ACTIVITY AND TO USE SAID LOGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETECTING USAGE IN VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS.</p>\n<p>DealDash reserves the right to at any time temporarily or permanently disqualify a user for violating these Terms.\nUsers will be disqualified when, in DealDash's reasonable opinion, a user has violated any law, regulation or equitable interest in favor of a third party, such as protecting users and the Service from manipulation.\nExamples of the foregoing include, but are not limited to, (i) honoring bids of users who have not paid for the Bids, (ii) the use of unauthorized bidding software, or (iii) establishing several user accounts for the same person.\nMoreover, DealDash reserves the right to cancel unauthorized DealDash accounts or accounts that have been inactive.\nEach user agrees not to hold DealDash responsible for any loss incurred as a result of such action.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Bid Purchasing for Online Bidding / Payment</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> All prices are quoted and payments processed in United States dollars.\nThe user is responsible for conversion rates and fees which may occur in case of a currency conversion done by their bank or payment processor.\n</p>\n<p>DealDash Bids must be purchased by users prior to online bidding.\nOnly registered users can submit the online bids, which can be purchased in packages (so-called 'Bid Packs') at the currently applicable prices, which can be viewed in 'My Dashboard' under 'Buy bids'.\nThe Bids must be paid for in advance.\nWhen the Bids are purchased and deposited into the user's DealDash account, a contract for the purchase of the Bids materializes.\nThe associated invoice is due immediately.\nIf a user is suspended for whatever reason, all of their Bids will be forfeited and will not be refunded.</p>\n<p>Users who have won an auction and paid for a product are not eligible for a refund on either Bid purchases, account activation fees, or product fees if their product has been shipped by the time of request.</p>\n<p>Should a payment not be honored for a user, a returned payment fee will be charged.\nThe user shall be solely responsible for these fees.\nDealDash reserves the right to block access to the user account until full payment is received by DealDash for the outstanding amount, including any fees due to returned payment, etc.\nDealDash may withhold any outstanding deliveries until it receives full payment.\nThe user's bank may or may not charge the user an international payment fee in connection with a credit card payment on the DealDash site.\nIt is the sole responsibility of the user to be familiar with the policies and practices of his or her bank for such fees.\nDealDash holds no responsibility for additional payment fees of any kind issued to the user by the user's bank.</p>\n<p>Unused Bids are eligible for a full refund only if the Bids have been purchased at their full price of 60c per Bid.</p>\n<p>Example (normal priced Bids): John purchases 100 Bids for $60 and Bids 10 times.\nAll the remaining 90 Bids are eligible for a total refund of $54 ( 90 * $0.60 ).</p>\n<p>If the Bids have been purchased at a promotional rate of less than 60c per Bid, only the portion of the purchased Bids that the customer would have received at 60c each is eligible for a refund.\nThe refundable portion of the Bids is always used first.</p>\n<p>Example (discount priced Bids): John purchases 100 Bids for $30 and Bids 10 times.\nOnly the first 50 Bids of those 100 Bids were refundable ( $30 / $0.60 = 50 ).\nJohn has 40 refundable Bids and 50 free Bids left on his account.\nHe is eligible for a refund of 40 * $0.60 = $24.</p>\n<p>DealDash reserves the right to sell Bids at any discounted price to specific user groups for promotional purposes.\nAll DealDash users understand that they may from time to time receive unique offers to buy discounted Bids and that other users may do so as well.\nSimilarly, users may see different product pricing, based partly on the activity characteristics of that user.\nDealDash may issue any number of free bids to users or user groups as part of special promotions or for any other reasons at its discretion.</p>\n<p>DealDash reserves the right to, at its discretion, remove any sign up or other promotional Bids that have been added to a user's account for free at any given time without further notice.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>No Questions Asked 100% Money Back Guarantee</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bidders on DealDash are entitled to a No Questions Asked 100% Money Back Guarantee on their first Bid Pack purchase.\nShould a bidder be unsatisfied with the Services for any reason, they are entitled to get their entire first Bid Pack purchase fully refunded in accordance with these Terms.\nTo qualify for a refund, users must email support@dealdash.com within 90 days of purchase and request for the refund.\nThe refund will be credited back to you in 7 business days.\nThe refund will be granted regardless of if you have won or lost auctions, or whether you have Bids left on your account or not.\nOnly 1 refund per person.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Bidding / BidBuddy</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For online bidding, an individual bid can be submitted by clicking the \"BID NOW\" button, or by using the automated bidding tool called the 'BidBuddy'.\nAfter the first Bid Pack purchase used Bids are no longer valid for refunds and it is deducted from the user's Bid balance accordingly.</p>\n<p>The BidBuddy can assist bidders in being able to bid in an auction, even if the bidders are not online at that time.\nOnly registered users can submit bids automatically with one or more BidBuddies.\nThe BidBuddy automatically submits bids according to the specifications set in advance by the user.\nThe user can read about how the BidBuddy operates in the 'FAQ' section.</p>\n<p>BidBuddy Guarantee: In very popular auctions, BidBuddies booked before the auction starts may not be able to place a bid before the No Jumper limit is reached.\nIn these cases, as long as the BidBuddy was booked before the auction started, and as long as your BidBuddy is not canceled, the spot in the auction is guaranteed.</p>\n<p>DealDash does not guarantee the precision of the BidBuddy feature and DealDash may not be held responsible for any BidBuddy software errors of commission or omission.\nThe user is prohibited from using any bidding software not authorized by DealDash.\nif the user does, in fact, use unauthorized software, it may result in immediate disqualification from DealDash's systems and Service.\nDealDash will from time to time award all users who start using the Site with free Bids.\nThe number of free Bids awarded or not awarded is determined solely by DealDash on an account by account basis.</p>\n<p>A bid is registered and counted only when DealDash's system registers the bid.\nA bid is not counted and valid when it is sent from the user's Web browser, but when DealDash's servers receive and register the bid request.</p>\n<p>It usually takes less than a second for a bid to be registered, however it may take up to several seconds or longer for DealDash to receive the bid if there is a delay in the network or if the system is under high stress.\nDealDash is not responsible for any delays that occur in bidding or in the auctions.\nDealDash strives to make the DealDash timer clocks as accurate as possible.\nWhile DealDash believes that auction timers are very accurate, DealDash cannot and does not guarantee that the system, including the bidding clock, will always function reliably.</p>\n<p>All bids are final.\nWinning bids and their associated fees are non-refundable.</p>\n<p>To comply with fair and honest auction practices, DealDash will reschedule auctions that end prematurely due to severe third party or technical problems to a later time.\nIn such events, where all bidders aren't able to participate normally in the auctions, DealDash will return all used Bids from such rescheduled auctions to all involved bidders.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Winning Limits</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As described in the House Rules, which are incorporated by reference, each user may win the same item, in the same auction type, only once in a limited time period, as specified in the details for each auction.\nThe winning limit resets automatically once the period has passed from the end onf the auction.\nThe system will prevent users from placing bids on an auction if they have already won the same product during the period.\nAll the booked BidBuddies will automatically be canceled for the other auctions of the same product, when the user wins an auction.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, each user may win up to 50 auctions per week.\nOnce a user has reached the 50 wins limit, the system will prevent them from placing bids on any auctions, and all booked BidBuddies will automatically be canceled.\nThe weekly winning limit resets at 00:00 PST on the day of the week you created your account.\n</p>\n<p>DealDash reserves the right to, from time to time review the guidelines for any winning limits and may at any time under its sole discretion limit accounts from winning an excessive amount of auctions.\nDealDash attempts to limit some auctions to users of comparable skill, as determined by DealDash, to enhance user experience and equal chances of winning auctions.\nIn so doing, DealDash may limit which auctions are available to particular users based on any factors deemed appropriate by DealDash in its sole discretion, including experience of the user, historical success of the user, demographic factors, prior bidding and spending activity, and other factors.\nIn particular, DealDash may limit certain auctions to less experienced or successful users in any manner DealDash deems appropriate to optimize the overall user experience of all DealDash users.\nYou acknowledge that You may be, and you consent to being, excluded from auctions at DealDash's discretion.</p>\n<p>This limit is put in place to ensure that all users have a high quality of user experience.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Bid Expiration</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Bids held in user accounts must be used within 365 days from the day that the Bids have entered the account through purchase, item exchange or auction win.\nIf the Bids have not been used within that time, they will expire and be permanently removed from the account.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>How the Auctions Work</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With each bid submitted, the price of the item on which the user is bidding increases by $0.01.\nA bid submitted by the user constitutes an offer from that user to DealDash to conclude a contract to purchase the item.\nA contract to purchase the item does not materialize until the auction is finished and the last bidder has followed all the steps provided for in this Section.\nThe purchase contract will exist between DealDash and the user who has submitted the highest bid up until the point when the last bidder has submitted the last qualifying bid of the respective auction.</p>\n<p>Each new bid resets the 'countdown time' for the auction.\nThe countdown time for each of the auctions is shown on the auction details.\nThe auction ends when no more bids are submitted within the remaining time stated.\nHowever, an auction may not end if anyone else except the highest bidder still has Bids booked on their BidBuddy.\nIn the event of heavy network lag, the BidBuddy may place the bid with a slight delay with the system registering the bid 1+ seconds after the auction's countdown time.\nSuch bid will be completely valid, provided that the bidder had booked his BidBuddy within the auction's countdown time.</p>\n<p>The user who submits the highest bid and is the last to bid wins the auction.\nAll other Bids on the item expire and will not be refunded.\nThe last bidder is determined based on the records in DealDash's database and DealDash's decision regarding the identity of the last bidder shall be final.\nIf a bid is placed too late, does not reset the timer of an auction or is not correctly registered by the system, it is then invalid.\nEven though this bid may be the last bid on an auction, it is the last and highest valid bid on an auction that wins the auction.</p>\n<p>An invalid bid is one where the auction timer is not reset after the bid has been placed.\nDealDash recommends its users to always bid at least 5 seconds prior to the auction timer reaches zero, as otherwise the bid might be reflected as accepted by the system, but in reality be received too late.</p>\n<p>Auctions may offer the 'Buy It Now &amp.\nGet your Bids Back' option (\"Buy it Now\").\n'Buy It Now' will allow you to receive your spent Bids back, if you purchase the same model of an identical item at its 'Buy it Now' price.\nThe option to 'Buy It Now' will be offered for a limited period of time (usually 7 days after the auction ends) after which the option to 'Buy It Now' is permanently revoked.</p>\n<p>The 'Buy it Now &amp.\nGet your Bids Back' option is offered at the 'Buy it Now &amp.\nGet your Bids Back' price listed for each auction.\nThe price may vary between auctions for the same product, but will not change not after the first bid has been placed in an auction.\nThe price is provided solely for the purpose of exercising the 'Buy it Now &amp.\nGet your Bids Back' option.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, DealDash can not guarantee that the 'Buy it Now &amp.\nGet your Bids Back' prices are comparable to prices for which the item is sold through retailers or other merchants elsewhere, and thus the 'Buy it Now &amp.\nGet your Bids Back' pricing should not be seen as a reflection of product value, or used for price comparisons or other similar purposes.</p>\n<p>DealDash is not responsible for third party abuse and manipulation of the DealDash service, for example, if other users create chaos on the Site that then results in lost bids.\nIn that case, and other cases of third party abuse, DealDash is not responsible.</p>\n<p>DealDash is constantly attempting to maintain fairness and balance in its auctions therefore some new users or users who have lost auctions may receive special promotions, access to special auctions, and/or free Bids through site features.\nThis is designed to maintain fair practice and helps balance and create a great auction experience for all users.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Notification of the Win / Acceptance of the Win / Payment</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After the auction has ended, the highest bidder ('winner') who is logged on with DealDash will see a 'congratulation page' displayed, along with all of the important information such as the total price, the payment details, etc.\nThe user must actively confirm the win by following the steps indicated on that page or elsewhere on the Services.\nAs soon as the winner has paid the total amount reflected on the 'payment page', the win is accepted.\nThe winner will also receive a notification of the win by e-mail with a request for payment.</p>\n<p>The user must pay the total price (auction price and applicable taxes) no later than 14 days after the notification of the win is sent.\nAfter this deadline has passed, DealDash can declare a rescission of the purchase contract to the user, which results in revocation of the user's right to delivery of the item.\nThere is likewise no entitlement to replacement of any of the Bids used in the auction.\nIf a user chooses to \"Buy it Now\", the item price including applicable tax fees must be paid within 7 days of the auction ending in order to be eligible.\nUsers are responsible for all applicable tax charges associated with purchases.</p>\n<p>Orders may be subject to sales tax (when applicable and required by law).\nBuy it Now orders the tax is based on the Buy it Now price and for auction wins the tax is based on the final auction price.\n</p>\n<p>The user may obtain and be legally entitled to the product only after the user fully pays for the product and all of the applicable Bids used to obtain the product.\nShould the user not pay for Bids that have already been purchased, payments received shall be viewed as payment toward the Bids not yet paid for, and a right of retention shall be exercised with regard to the item purchased at auction until all Bids and the total price have been paid in full.\nIf the user chooses to pay for the item by credit card and the sales price is lower than $1, then the price may be rounded up to $1.</p>\n<p>DealDash may offer the option to exchange the auction win to bids.\nIf available, the offer is presented before making a payment for the auction win.\nIf the user accepts the exchange to bids offer the bids are added to the user's account, and the user loses the option to pay the auction price (plus applicable taxes) to obtain the item.\nThe offer may change over time and vary between users and auctions.</p>\n<p>If the user does not receive the won product or product obtained through \"Buy it Now\", the user must file in a claim of non-receipt via e-mail to support@dealdash.com within sixty (60) calendar days of the purchase, or DealDash's obligation to deliver the product will end.\nNo refunds of the purchase amount or cost of spent Bids to win the item will be returned to the user.</p>\n<p>DealDash is not responsible for stolen or lost items.\nIn the event that a product is stolen or lost, DealDash will do its best to help customers upon request, by providing tracking information received from the supplier, as well as screenshots or copies of the sales receipt and possible shipping confirmation, if available.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Cancellation / Rescission</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The user may return the item in an un-depreciated condition within 30 days of receipt if not satisfied for any reason.\nUpon verification of the product's condition, DealDash will refund the purchase price of the product.\nDealDash will not refund the value of the Bids spent to obtain the product.\nIn the event that a user wishes to return a Buy it Now order the user also forfeits all the Free Bids given to them alongside the purchase.\nIf the user has used the Free Bids given to them, the user will need to purchase the equivalent number of Bids in order for DealDash to process the refund.\nOnce both the item has been returned and the Free Bids removed from the user's account, a refund will be given.\nOnly Bids that have been acquired by purchasing Bid Packs for the then-current full price shall have a right for refund within 30 calendar days of purchase (90 calendar days for first Bid pack purchase).\nSuch paid Bids are always used first, before promotional Bids, free Bids, Bids obtained through the Buy it Now or other bids that have been obtained in any other way than paying full price for each Bid.\nBids obtained during the Buy it Now process do not have any rights to refund.\nDealDash also grants to the user ordering products for personal purposes the right to cancel in accordance with statutory provisions on mail order sales and e-commerce.\nThe right to cancel does not exist in the case of mail order sales and e-commerce contracts for the delivery of audio and video recordings or of software, if and to the extent that the seal on the delivered media has been broken by the user.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to cancel</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may cancel your contract within 30 days in written notice (e.g.\nletter, e-mail) to DealDash or by returning the items, without stating your reasons.</p>\n<p>The 30 day period begins when the item is received.\nReceipt can be e-mail receipt to the e-mail address provided to DealDash below.\nCancellation is to be sent to the following address:</p>\n<p>DealDash Inc<br> 11670 Fountains Drive<br> Suite 200<br> Maple Grove, MN 55369<br> E-Mail: support@dealdash.com</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Consequences of Cancellation</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the case of a valid cancellation, both parties must return what has been received in performance of the contract and the benefits derived therefrom (e.g.\ninterest) as applicable.\nIf user is unable to return to DealDash the service or product that the user received or is only able to return it in part or only in a depreciated condition, the user must compensate DealDash for the difference in value, unless the deterioration resulted from proper use.\nIn the case of use of items, the foregoing compensation provision will not apply if the deterioration of the item is attributable solely to it being tested comparable to those tests that may reasonably be performed in a retail store.\nIn other respects, the user may avoid this duty to pay compensation by not using the item(s) as the user would use his/her own property, and by refraining from any action that would detract from its value.\nItems that can be shipped in packages are to be returned.\nIn these cases, return is free of charge for the user.\nItems that cannot be shipped in packages will be picked up upon coordination with the user.\nA user must satisfy obligations to refund payments within 30 days after sending the user's notice of cancellation.</p>\n<p>When a user cancels by the deadline, the user is not obligated to accept delivery.\nUnder those circumstances where DealDash cancels by the deadline, DealDash will refund any purchase price already paid.\nThe foregoing notwithstanding, the service charge (e.g.\nmoney spent on purchase of Bids) will not be refunded.</p>\n<p>Users may return items received from DealDash within 30 days of receipt for any reason however are subject to applicable return shipping or pick up fees.</p>\n<p>Should DealDash incur additional costs for insufficient postage on the return, for a COD shipment, or for courier shipments and other irregular shipping methods that are over and above postal shipping costs, these costs will be deducted from any payment remitted by the user.\nItems in sets and boxes can only be returned in their entirety.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Delivery</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unless otherwise agreed, delivery will be made from DealDash's supplier's warehouse or from DealDash's warehouse to the address provided by the user.\nDeliveries are made solely within the continental US.\nDealDash may engage third parties to satisfy its contractual obligations without being required to notify the buyer.\nObvious damage to the item from transport or packaging damaged during transport is to be reported to the supplier upon taking delivery.</p>\n<p>Should DealDash not be able to deliver the item ordered for whichever reason, DealDash is entitled to declare rescission to the user or to substitute the item with a comparable replacement product with similar features.\nDealDash may also choose to replace the item ordered with a gift card of the value of the item that the user may choose to use to obtain the same product.\nThis also applies for items ordered through Buy it Now from the DealDash store.</p>\n<p>If the product delivered is damaged, defective, or otherwise does not match the product description, DealDash will replace the product at DealDash's expense.\nPlease contact support@dealdash.com to arrange return and replacement of any such product.\nReplacement is not covered for any items shipped to a freight forwarding company and shipment to a freight forwarding company is not permitted under these Terms.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Right of Substitution</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Subject to the cancellation policy specified herein, DealDash may substitute another similar item of the same general character or function, provided it has the same or higher retail value, for purposes of delivery to the user.\nDealDash may substitute another similar item of a lesser value if the user requests one, or furnish the user with a gift card.\nA gift card may be the most suitable substitute solution for challenges related to product availability or supplier challenges.\nSuch right of substitution may be necessary from time to time if, for example, unforeseen or undetected challenges arise with the manufacturing or inventory system of the supplier, impacting the ability to deliver the exact item sought by the user.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Product Correction </strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If DealDash is unable to provide the user with the item auctioned due to unforeseen circumstances, DealDash reserves the right to offer the winner in its absolute discretion an alternative item in the same price range or the equivalent of the item's Manufacturer's Recommended Retail Price ('MSRP') in Bids so that if a Bid's then-current price is $0.60, DealDash issuing one (1) Bid to the user is equal to $0.60.</p>\n<p>Should subsequent correction be undertaken by way of delivery of the item originally auctioned, the user shall be obligated to return to DealDash the substituted item delivered within 30 days at DealDash's expense.\n</p>\n<p>Items delivered shall remain DealDash's property until payment in full of the total price, including for the Bids used in the auction.\nUntil such time as full payment has been made, the user undertakes to store the item separately from their other possessions and to insure it.\nDealDash shall have full rights of access to the place where the item is located during normal business hours to take possession of it.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Merchandise Sources</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You acknowledge that items sold on DealDash may come from suppliers owned by DealDash or where one or more ultimate DealDash
