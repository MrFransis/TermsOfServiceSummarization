Warranty</p>\n<p>SimpliSafe warrants to you, the initial purchaser of the System from SimpliSafe or an authorized retailer, that each of the products that make up your SimpliSafe System (\u201cCovered Products\u201d) will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service for three (3) years from the date that you purchase the Covered Products.\nThis limited warranty is non-transferrable.\n<strong>As a condition of this warranty, SimpliSafe may require that you provide proof of purchase during the warranty period and/or return the defective Covered Product.\n</strong>If SimpliSafe requires the return of the defective Covered Product, return shipping costs will be paid for by SimpliSafe.</p>\n<p>Within the warranty period, SimpliSafe\u2019s sole obligations shall be limited to accepting return of the defective product or part of the Covered Product and providing one or more of the following remedies, to be determined at SimpliSafe\u2019s sole discretion:</p>\n<p>Replacement of Covered Products:</p>\n<p>For valid warranty claims made during the warranty period with respect to Covered Products, SimpliSafe may provide you with a substantially functional equivalent product or part to replace the defective item.</p>\n<p>Replacement products provided under this Limited Warranty may be new, repaired or reconditioned, at the sole option of SimpliSafe.\nSimpliSafe warrants any replacement products for a three (3) year limited warranty period from the date the replacement parts are shipped to you.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if a Covered Product has been discontinued and/or the substantially functional equivalent available replacement product or part to be issued in connection with this warranty would no longer be compatible with your System, <u>at SimpliSafe\u2019s sole discretion</u>, SimpliSafe may offer you additional substantially functional equivalent replacement product(s) to address the compatibility issue.\nYou understand and agree that this offer to replace other System components to address compatibility issues shall fully satisfy SimpliSafe\u2019s remedy under this or any other applicable product warranty (to the extent this does not contradict or conflict with the terms thereof).\n<u>If rejected</u>, you will be deemed to have waived any other rights or remedies under this Limited Warranty.\nIn no event shall SimpliSafe bear any responsibility for installation any replacement product or part or the cost of such installation.</p>\n<p>Refund or Credit:</p>\n<p>At SimpliSafe\u2019s sole option and discretion, in lieu of replacing the defective Covered Product, SimpliSafe may instead offer to refund the original purchase price you paid to SimpliSafe or an authorized retailer for the Covered Product.\nIf the defective Covered Product does not have a separate purchase price, SimpliSafe shall determine a purchase price based upon the overall purchase price of any system that the defective Covered Product may have been a part of.\nSuch determination shall be solely within SimpliSafe\u2019s discretion.\nSubject to availability, and at SimpliSafe\u2019s sole option and discretion, instead of refund you may select a store credit of equal or greater value than the aforementioned refund value (to be determined by SimpliSafe), which may be applied toward other SimpliSafe products or services (to be determined by SimpliSafe).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if offered, the store credit remedy option would be offered as an alternative to the refund remedy option, presented for your selection of one or the other.\n<strong>This refund or credit remedy option shall only be made available at SimpliSafe\u2019s sole discretion and option.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For warranty service, please contact SimpliSafe Customer Support at 1-800-548-9508 or visit www.simplisafe.com/support and click on \u201cContact Us\u201d.\nIf SimpliSafe is unable to address the issue that you are facing, SimpliSafe will, subject solely to its discretion, determine the appropriate warranty remedy or warranty remedy option, as listed above.</p>\n<p>As explained above, SimpliSafe may, at its discretion, require you return the Covered Product before SimpliSafe determines which warranty remedy option to provide.\nIn this situation, SimpliSafe will provide you with a prepaid return slip for you to return your old product or part to SimpliSafe.\nIn the event that SimpliSafe opts to send you a replacement product or part, as a remedy under this Limited Warranty and does <strong>not </strong>require prior return of such product or part as part of the warranty validation process, such replacement product or part may at SimpliSafe\u2019s discretion still be shipped along with a postage prepaid return slip, and you will return your old product or part to SimpliSafe using such slip.\nFailure to return your old product or part in this instance may void any limited warranty on your replacement product or part, to be determined at SimpliSafe\u2019s sole discretion.</p>\n<p>This Limited Warranty does not apply in the following cases: failure to follow installation or operating instructions, misuse (which includes, without limitation, using products outdoors unless outdoor use is expressly permitted, and in such cases only as directed, and/or use in improper temperature, humidity or other environmental conditions), alteration, abuse, accident or tampering, or damage or non-performance resulting from use of any item or repair services not provided by SimpliSafe, as well as where your System or any component thereof is obtained from a third party other than SimpliSafe or an authorized retailer.\nThis Limited Warranty also does not apply if damage was caused by Acts of God, natural disasters, labor disputes, war, terrorism, civil strife, or other causes beyond SimpliSafe\u2019s control (including but not limited to changes impacting the performance, operation or sustainability of third-party communications and technology platforms, networks and protocols).\nConsumable parts, such as batteries or battery replacement, and adhesive tapes are excluded from this Limited Warranty.\nProducts that are tested and found to be in good working condition (not defective) are not covered by this Limited Warranty.</p>\n<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THIS LIMITED WARRANTY IS EXCLUSIVE AND EXPRESSLY IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, OBLIGATIONS OR LIABILITIES, WHETHER WRITTEN, ORAL, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS

not an ANSI or BHMA certified door lock or deadbolt, and it must be correctly installed and used with a certified door lock that is operating in good condition.\nand used in environmental conditions

YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE REQUIREMENT OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nCertain portions of this section are deemed to be a \u201cwritten agreement to arbitrate\u201d pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.\nYou and SimpliSafe agree that SimpliSafe intends that this section satisfies the \u201cwriting\u201d requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nIn the event of any dispute or disagreement between the parties, or claim or question by a party, arising from or relating to these Terms of Sale or the breach hereof (collectively, a \u201cDispute\u201d), the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to settle the Dispute.\nTo this effect, the parties shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties.\nIf the parties do not reach such solution within a period of 60 days then, upon notice by either party to the other, such Dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nOnce the Dispute is submitted to the AAA for arbitration each party must pay the appropriate filing fees.\nAll expenses of the arbitrator and any AAA expenses shall be borne by SimpliSafe.\nThe parties will remain individually responsible for their own attorney costs or other non-AAA required costs, including but not limited to the expenses of witnesses for either side, which shall be borne by the party producing such witnesses.\nIf an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted at an American Arbitration Association office that is reasonably convenient for both parties.\nIf the parties are unable to agree on a location, a determination on location shall be made by the Independent ADR Institution or the neutral arbitrator.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator selected by the AAA who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than 15 years of experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nThe arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Sale and will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<p>You can obtain the AAA procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:</p>\n<p>AAA: 800.778.7879<br>http://www.adr.org/</p>\n<p>In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms of Sale and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys\u2019 fees).\nHowever, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.\nThe parties agree that the arbitration shall be confidential.\nAll parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.</p>\n<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR SIMPLISAFE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR SIMPLISAFE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF

FOREGOING, THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIM SEEKING DAMAGES IN TORT FOR BODILY INJURY, INCLUDING EMOTIONAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL INJURY, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR LOSS OF USE OR DIMINUTION IN VALUE OF PROPERTY.\nIN ADDITION, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS OR ON ANY BASIS INVOLVING ANY DISPUTE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, OTHER PERSONS OR ENTITIES DOING BUSINESS WITH SIMPLISAFE, OR OTHER PERSONS OR ENTITIES SIMILARLY SITUATED.\nFURTHERMORE, ANY DISPUTE BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST SIMPLISAFE MAY NOT BE JOINED OR CONSOLIDATED IN THE ARBITRATION WITH CLAIMS BROUGHT BY OR AGAINST ANY OTHER SIMPLISAFE SUBSCRIBER, UNLESS OTHERWISE AGREED BY THE PARTIES.\nFURTHER, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS PERTAINING TO ANY
