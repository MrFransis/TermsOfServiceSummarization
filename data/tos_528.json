the \u201cfirst half of 2016\u201d (the most specific we\u2019re permitted to be), we received a subpoena from the Eastern District of Virginia.\nThe subpoena required us to provide information about two Signal users for a federal grand jury investigation.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve designed the Signal service to minimize the data we retain about Signal users, so the only information we can produce in response to a request like this is the date and time a user registered with Signal and the last date of a user\u2019s connectivity to the Signal service.</p>\n<p>Notably, things we <em>don\u2019t</em>

end-to-end encrypted, so we don\u2019t have that information either.</p>\n<p>This is the first subpoena that we\u2019ve received.\nIt originally included a broad gag order that would have prevented us from publishing this notice, but the ACLU represented us in quickly and successfully securing our ability to publish the transcripts below.\nWe\u2019re committed to treating any future requests the same way: working with effective and talented organizations like the ACLU, and publishing transcripts of our responses to government requests here.</p>\n<p>Below is the transcript for this

algorithm, which is used by two parties to exchange encrypted messages based on a shared secret key.\nThe parties derive new keys for every Double Ratchet message so that earlier keys cannot be calculated from later ones.\nThe parties also send Diffie-Hellman public values attached to their messages.\nThe results of Diffie-Hellman calculations are mixed into the derived keys so that later keys cannot be calculated from earlier ones.\nThese properties give some protection to earlier or later encrypted messages in case of a compromise of a party's keys.</p>\n<p> Sesame</p>\n<p> This
