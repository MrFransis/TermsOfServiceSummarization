the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification.\nUsers can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>\nWho the right of withdrawal applies to\n<p>Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>\n<p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>\nExercising the right of withdrawal\n<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>\n<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the \u201cdefinitions\u201d section of this document.\nUsers are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.\nIn order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>\n<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Regarding the purchase of goods,</strong> the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day on which the User or a third party \u2013 other than the carrier and designated by the User \u2013 takes physical possession of the goods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Regarding the purchase of several goods ordered together</strong> but delivered separately or in case of purchase of a single good consisting of multiple lots or pieces delivered separately, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day on which the User or a third party \u2013 other than the carrier and designated by the User \u2013 acquires physical possession of the last good, lot or piece.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Effects of withdrawal\n<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>\n<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User\u2019s decision to withdraw from the contract.\nUnless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.\nIn any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>\n\u2026on the purchase of physical goods\n<p>Unless the Owner has offered to collect the goods, Users shall send back the goods or hand them over to the Owner, or to a person authorized by the latter to receive the goods, without undue delay and in any event within 14 days from the day on which they communicated their decision to withdraw from the contract.</p>\n<p>The deadline is met if the goods are handed to the carrier, or otherwise returned as indicated above, before the expiration of the 14-days-period for returning the goods.\nThe reimbursement may be withheld until reception of the goods, or until Users have supplied evidence of having returned the goods, whichever is the earliest.</p>\n<p>Users shall only be liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling of the goods outside of that which is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics and functioning.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The costs of returning the goods are borne by the User</strong>.</p> GuaranteesLegal guarantee of conformity for goods\n<p>Under EU law, for a minimum period of 2 years after delivery, traders guarantee the conformity of the goods they sell.\nThis means that traders must ensure that the goods purchased have the promised quality, or the quality that can be reasonably expected, functionality or characteristics for at least two years after they\u2019ve been delivered to the purchaser.</p>\n<p>Where Users qualify as European Consumers, the legal guarantee of conformity for goods applies to the items available on this Website in accordance with the laws of the country of their habitual residence.</p>\n<p>National laws of such country may grant such Users broader rights.</p>\n<p>Consumers who do not qualify as European may benefit from legal guarantee of conformity rights in accordance with the legislation of the country of their habitual residence.</p>\nMoney-back-guarantee for goods\n<p>Without prejudice to any applicable statutory rights, the Owner grants Users the right to cancel a purchase they are unsatisfied with, and obtain a refund, within 60 days from the day on which the purchased goods have been delivered.</p>\n<p>The Owner shall refund the price of the Product purchased using the same payment method as the original transaction.<br>\nIn order to make use of this right, Users must send an unambiguous notice to the Owner.\nWhile a motivation is not required, Users are kindly asked to specify the reason why they are claiming the money-back-guarantee.</p>\n<p>Within the same period of time stated above, Users must also return the purchased goods to the Owner at their own expense, making sure that they are undamaged, clean and fit for resale.\nGoods must be returned inside the original packaging.<br>\nUpon receipt of the goods, the Owner will verify that all conditions applicable to the money-back-guarantee are fulfilled and, if so, refund the purchase price.</p> Liability and indemnificationAustralian UsersLimitation of
