"xpath": "//*[@id=\"main\"]/div/div/div/div/div/div", "text": "<p>This privacy policy (\"Policy\") sets out how we, Joya Communications Inc.\n(\"Joya\"), makers of the Marco Polo\u00ae video sharing app (the \u201cMarco Polo App\u201d) and Marco Polo Channels app (the \u201cChannels App,\u201d and together with the Marco Polo App, the \u201cApps,\u201d use and protect the personal information of people who use the Apps or who visit Marco Polo websites such as www.marcopolo.me (the \u201cMarco Polo Website\u201d).\nWe will refer to the Marco Polo App, Channels App, and Marco Polo Website collectively as the \"Service\" or \u201cMarco Polo.\u201d</p>\nPrivacy Principles\n<p>Joya has two fundamental principles when it comes to personal information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We don't sell your personal information or use it to show you ads.</li>\n<li>We only store the personal information that we need to operate our Service so you can communicate with the people you choose.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This Policy applies to anyone who accesses the Service.\nBy visiting the Website and/or using the Apps or Service, you acknowledge that the collection, use, and sharing of your information will take place as described in this Policy.</p>\n<p>So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase \"Personal Information\" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked with you, such as your name, email, or mobile number.</p>\nWhat we collect\n<p>Marco Polo is a communication service.\nTo operate the Service, we may collect Personal Information you choose to provide us.</p>\n1.\nMarco Polo App\na.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>To create a Marco Polo account (\u201cAccount\u201d), you provide your mobile number, your name and your email address, and may choose to provide your photo, birth day and birth month.\nOnly other registered Marco Polo users that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>already have your phone number in their phone\u2019s address book,</li>\n<li>are in a group with you, or</li>\n<li>you invited to Marco Polo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>may see your name, photo, mobile number, email, birth day and/or birth month.\nNote that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they\u2019ve saved and not by the name you provided to Marco Polo.\nFor example, your spouse will still see you as \u201cLove\u201d when they use the app if that\u2019s how you appear in their phone\u2019s address book.\nIf you chose to provide them, we collect your birth day and month so people you know get reminded when it\u2019s your birthday.</p>\nb.\nPolo Messages and Scrapbooks\n<p>Marco Polo is a cloud service.\nWe may collect and store the content you create, including videos (or \u201cPolos\u201d), photos, short video clips you share with selected contacts (or \u201cScrapbook moments\u201d), and text messages.\nWe store this Personal Information on our servers so that you can access your data anytime from any of your devices that have the Marco Polo App without having to rely on third-party backups or use up your phone\u2019s memory.\nOur servers are located in the United States.</p>\nc.\nContacts\n<p>You may choose to provide us with your friends' contact information as stored on your phone.\nMarco Polo uses mobile phone numbers and email addresses as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to find and communicate with other people you know.\nWe ask your permission before syncing your contacts, and you can still use the app without giving it access to your contacts (though you will have a harder time finding people you know who also use Marco Polo).</p>\n<p>We store your contacts on our servers in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts creates a Marco Polo Account and to properly display their names.\nWe store their name, phone number(s), email address(es), and/or birth day and month for this to work.</p>\n<p>Our automatic algorithms also use this data to suggest which of your contacts you might like to communicate with on Marco Polo.\nWe use this information to suggest people to invite to join Marco Polo but we do not contact anyone in your phone\u2019s contact list without your permission.\nOther than our Service Providers that we describe below, we do not share your contacts with third parties unless required to do so in response to valid legal requests, such as through a court order or search warrant.</p>\n2.\nChannels App\n<p>Through Channels, you can be a leader or member of a Channels group.\nLeaders facilitate learning and/or provide guidance on various topics.\nYou can subscribe to become a Channels member by joining a particular leader\u2019s group and paying the subscription fee set by that leader.</p>\na.\nBasic Account Data\n<p>To create a Marco Polo Channels member account (\u201cAccount\u201d), you provide your mobile number, your name, and your email address, and may choose to provide your photo and other social media identifiers.\nChannel leaders will have access to this data while you maintain an active paid membership to their channel.</p>\n<p>Other Channels group members will see your name and photo, but your email and mobile number will not be shared with other Channels group members unless you explicitly choose to do so.</p>\nb.\nOther Data\n<p>If you subscribe to a Channels group, the Channels leader and other members will also receive any other personal information you choose to share with the group.</p>\n<p>To be a Channels member, you pay the subscription fee directly to the Channels leader or through Joya.\nIf through Joya, you need to provide a valid credit card number, expiration date, CCV, and billing zipcode.\nThis data is directly processed by Stripe and only the last four digits of the credit card number and billing zip code are made available to Joya and the group leader.\nAlthough we receive the last four digits of Channels members\u2019 credit card number, we do not store it.\nAlso, although Channels leaders may also see the last four digits of members\u2019 credit card number, they are contractually obligated to not share or otherwise use that information.\nFor more information about how Stripe will use this information, please visit Stripe\u2019s privacy policy at&nbsp;https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal.</p>\n3.\nUser Support\n<p>If you contact Marco Polo support, any Personal Information you may share with us is used only for the purposes of researching the issue and contacting you about your request.</p>\n4.\nAdditional Technical Information\n<p>We use third-party analytics Service Providers (as more fully described below, and including Google Analytics and amplitude.com) to automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device, and how you interact with the Service.\nFor example, when you access the Service, we may log\u200e your operating system type,\u200e browser type and\u200e language,\u200e the pages you viewed,\u200e how long you spent on a page,\u200e access times,\u200e Internet protocol (IP) address, your mobile device ID, mobile device serial number, unique user ID, wireless carrier, and information about your use of and actions on the Service.\nMarco Polo collects this additional technical data to analyze usage trends and give us more information about how people use the Service to better the user experience.</p>\n4.1 Cookies\n<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate

our Service or in our emails.\nWe use web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn which emails are read and used by our users and which are not.\nWe also use web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails.\nSimilar to cookies, we use web beacons to improve your experience with our Service.</p>\n<p>Tracking Options and California Do Not Track Disclosures.\nYou are welcome to adjust your browser or operating system settings to limit this tracking or to decline cookies and doing so will not change your experience in the Marco Polo App or Website.</p>\n<p>Check the \"Help\" menu of your browser or operating system to learn how to change your tracking settings or cookie preferences.\nFor example:</p>\n<p>With Chrome:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At the top right, click More Settings.</li>\n<li>At the bottom, click Advanced.</li>\n<li>Under \"Privacy and security,\" turn on \"Do Not Track.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With Firefox, follow the

anywhere in the world, including outside the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d).\nNote that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of the Apps, you are instructing us, as part of our contract with you, to transfer your Personal Information, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security for your Personal Information that is appropriate to the risk.</p>\n<p>If Marco Polo or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, Personal Information held by us about our users will be one of the transferred assets.\nSuch third party will be required to treat that Personal Information in a manner consistent with this Policy.</p>\nService Providers\n<p>We work with third parties to provide some of our Service (\"Service Providers\").\nFor example, we use Third-Party SMS Providers to send a verification code to your phone number when you register on the Marco Polo App.\nService Providers will have access to your Personal Information needed to perform their business functions, but may not use or share that Personal Information for purposes outside the scope of their functions related to the Service.</p>\nOur Commitment towards Children's Privacy\n<p>We do not direct the Service to, nor do we knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under 13.\nChildren under 13 are not eligible to use the Service.\nIf we learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent that user from utilizing the Service.</p>\nNotification Choices\n<p>By default, Marco Polo sends you emails and notifications regarding activities on the Service, e.g., when you receive a Polo from one of your contacts or when a Channels group leader you subscribe to posts a new video.</p>\n<p>We may also communicate with
