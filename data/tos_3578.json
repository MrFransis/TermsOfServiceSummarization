<p>The personal information that we may collect about you broadly falls into the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Information that you provide voluntarily </em>\n<ul>\n<li>Certain parts of our Website may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily: for example, we may ask you to provide your contact details in order to register an account with us, to subscribe to marketing communications from us, and/or to submit enquiries to us.\nThe personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the

</em>\n<ul>\n<li>When you visit our Website, we may collect certain information automatically from your device.\nIn some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.</li>\n<li>Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g.\ncountry or city-level location) and other technical information.\nWe may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our Website, including the pages accessed and links clicked.\n</li>\n<li>Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Website, where they come from, and what content on our Website is of interest to them.\nWe use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Website to our visitors.</li>\n<li>Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading \u201cCookies and similar tracking technology\u201d below.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Information that we obtain from third party sources </em>\n<ul>\n<li>From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from third party sources (including Sidekick for Business), but only where we have checked that these third parties either have your consent or are otherwise legally permitted or required to disclose your personal information to us.\n</li>\n<li>The types of information we collect from third parties include names, email addresses, mailing addresses and IP addresses and we use the information we receive from these third parties to send invitations to Corsair events, newsletters with marketing updates, press announcements, promotional offers, survey requests, sweepstakes prizes and localizing our webpages to suit preferences and to mitigate Denial of Service attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, we will use the personal information we collect from you only for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice or for purposes that we explain to you at the time we collect your personal information.\nHowever, we may also use your personal information for other purposes that are not incompatible with the purposes we have disclosed to you (such as archiving purposes in the public interest) if and where this is permitted by applicable data protection laws.</p> Who does Corsair share my personal information with? <ul>\n<li>We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients: <ul>\n<li> to our <strong>group companies, third party services providers and partners</strong> who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website and product order fulfilment), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information.\n</li>\n<li> to any <strong>competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party</strong> where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;</li>\n<li>to a <strong>potential buyer </strong>(and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice.\n</li>\n<li>to any <strong>other person with your consent</strong> to the disclosure.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA visitors only) <p>If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.\n</p>\n<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.\nIn some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>\n<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d.</p> Cookies and similar tracking technology <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, \u201cCookies\u201d) to collect and use personal information about you, including to serve interest-based advertising.\nFor further information about the types of Cookies we use, why, and how you can control Cookies, please see our Cookie Notice.\nCookies Settings</p> How does Corsair keep my personal information secure? <p>We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you.\nThe measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.\nWe use industry security best practices in securing personal data including encryption in some cases.\nWe partner with proven technology cloud partners who have proven security measures in place to ensure data is protected.</p> International data transfers <p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.\nThese countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).</p>\n<p>Specifically, our Website servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world.\nThis means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.</p>\n<p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.\nThese include implementing Binding Corporate Rules / the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.\n</p>\n<p>Our Binding Corporate Rules / Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request.\nWe have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners.</p> Data retention <p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).\n</p>\n<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n</p> Your data protection rights <p>You have the following data protection rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you wish to <strong>access, correct, update or request deletion</strong> of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting
