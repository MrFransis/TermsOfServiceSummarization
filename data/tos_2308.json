www.ebates.com and www.rakuten.com (\"Company\") and offers a service enabling you to enroll a payment card in order to earn rewards or benefits when you make qualifying transactions at participating merchants (\"Service\").</p>\n<p>You accept these terms when you enroll a card in the Service.\nCompany may add to, change or remove any part of these terms from time to time.\nIf Company changes any material terms that would have a material adverse effect on your rights as they are presented to you in these terms, Company will notify you via email or through other reasonable electronic means.\nYour continued participation in the Service, including receiving benefits and rewards when you make a qualifying transaction at participating merchants, constitutes your acceptance of any changes to these terms.</p>\n<p>To receive benefits and rewards through the Service, you must enroll a valid, eligible card with the Service.\nCompany leverages the transaction matching technology provided by the Rakuten Card Linked Offer Network, Inc.\n(\"RCLON\" and together with Company, \"we\" or \"us\") to provide you the Services.\nCompany also collaborates with third party offer networks, including but not limited to Rewards Network Establishment Services Inc.\n(\u201cOffer Networks\u201d) to provide you additional offers and features to the Services.</p>\n<p>By enrolling a card in the Service, you agree that your payment card network (e.g., MasterCard, American Express, Visa) or payment processor may monitor transactions on your enrolled card at participating merchants and share Transaction Data (defined below) with us for the purposes of determining whether you have made a qualifying purchase and providing you targeted offers.\nTransaction Data includes, but is not limited to, merchant name, merchant location or other store identifier, transaction date, and transaction amount.\nWe will also share details of your qualifying purchases with Offer Networks in order for you to participate in the additional rewards programs you choose.\nYou agree that none of the payment card networks have any responsibility or liability in connection with the Service.</p>\n<p>You may remove your payment cards from the Service at any time by visiting My Wallet.\nWhen you do so, we will no longer receive future Transaction Data associated with your payment card, but we will retain historical Transaction Data to track rewards and benefits due under the Service and for account management and member services purposes.</p>\n<p>Card and Transaction Eligibility</p>\n<p>The Service is limited to payment card transactions processed through the payment card networks and supported payment card processors.\nIf a payment card transaction is processed outside one of the payment card networks or payment card processors with which we are integrated, we will not receive the Transaction Data and we will not be able to match it with an offer.\nPayment cards not eligible for use with the Service include, without limitation, corporate and purchasing cards, Health Savings Account (HSA) cards, Flexible Spending Account (FSA) cards, government-administered prepaid cards (including EBT cards), insurance prepaid cards and Visa Buxx.</p>\n<p>Not all merchant locations or transactions with your enrolled card may be eligible for benefits and rewards, including PIN-based purchases, payments made through third-party digital wallets or payment apps other than Apple Pay\u00ae and other transactions not processed through the payment card network\u2019s own system.\nDo not use a Personal Identification Number (PIN) when paying for your purchase transactions if you want the transaction to qualify for rewards or benefits under the Service.</p>\n<p>The rewards for which you are eligible may vary depending on a variety of factors, such as the participating merchant and your level of activity within the Service.\nYou may be eligible for rewards and offers that are not available to others and other rewards and benefits may not be available to you.\nInformation on the type, amount, limits, and other conditions on rewards and benefits available to you, as well as current participating merchants, are available by signing in to your account with your unique login.\nYou are responsible for reviewing this information before you make a purchase at a participating merchant, as these details may change from time to time and may affect the rewards and offers you receive.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a participating merchant\u2019s payment card processor may experience a lag time (approximately 24 hours) between when a credit card is enrolled and when the payment card processor is able to identify and provide us with the Transaction Data associated with the card.\nIf you believe that you are eligible for rewards for dining at a participating merchant, and those rewards have not registered in your account within 10 days of the dine, please visit https://www.rakuten.com/help/missing-cash-back We reserve the right to require that you provide a receipt from the participating merchant or documents reasonably required by us to evidence an eligible transaction in order to receive your reward.</p>\n<p>Limits on enrolled cards</p>\n<p>You may register up to twelve (12) cards with our restaurant program, but any one eligible card may be enrolled in only one dining program.\nIf you subsequently enroll a registered card with another dining program that is not operated by us, we will remove your card from participating in our dining program.\nFor example, if you enrolled your credit card to earn rewards under our Restaurants In-Store Offers, and you later enroll that same credit card to earn rewards under a third-party dining program, you will no longer be eligible to earn rewards under our Restaurant In-Store Offers, and we will notify you of this by email.</p>\n<p>Data Sharing and Usage</p>\n<p>To operate the Service, we will share and

and our respective third-party suppliers, vendors, or contractors to facilitate and administer the Services.</li>\n<li>Analyze Transaction Data to create performance reports that may be shared with

participating merchants or their agents to validate qualifying transactions and assess the results of specific campaigns.</li>\n<li>Share Transaction Data with certain participating publishers so they can provide rewards and benefits to you and assess merchant campaign performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others</p>\n<p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.\nWe will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private

or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>\n<p>License to the Service</p>\n<p>Subject to these terms, Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and revocable license to access and use the Service.\nCompany (or its affiliate) reserves the right to change, upgrade or discontinue the Service or any feature of the Service at any time, with or without notice.</p>\n<p>Privacy, Security and Information

information and any other matter relating to your use of the Service.</p>\n<p>Termination</p>\n<p>We reserve the right, at any time, to modify or discontinue offering the Service in our sole discretion.\nIf you are dissatisfied with any aspect of the Service at any time, your sole and exclusive remedy is to cease using the Service.\nYou agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or termination of the Service.</p>\n<p>Service Limitations, Qualifications &amp.\nDisclaimers</p>\n<p>Any failure to comply with these terms, any fraud or abuse relating to the accrual or receipt of benefits and rewards, or any misrepresentation of any information furnished to Company or its affiliates by you or anyone acting on your behalf may result in the termination of your enrollment in the Service and forfeiture of your benefits and rewards.</p>\n<p>The Service is being provided to member \"as is,\" with no warranty.\nWe reserve the right to terminate the Service at any time with or without notice.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all representations and warranties, express or implied, with respect to the Service.</p>\n<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Company, RCLON, the Offer Network, the payment card networks and each of their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors and employees harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorney's fees, made by any party due to or arising out of your use of the Service.</p>\n<p>If any provision of these terms is found invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible, and the other provisions contained herein will remain in full force and effect.\nCompany's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.\nThese terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Company with
