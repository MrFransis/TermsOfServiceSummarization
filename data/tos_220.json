<small>\n</small>Passwords <ul>\n<li>Think of passwords as keys.\nUse a different one for each account, as if it is stolen it can be used to take over all your accounts.</li>\n<li>Make it strong by

probably is.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Scams come in many guises.\nbe it social media, email, phone calls, etc.\nBe suspicious if you are offered a deal, service or prize, especially if you are required to make a payment or provide personal details.&nbsp;Often the deals are only available for limited time periods, forcing you to make an instant decision.</p>\n<p>There is an internet fraud practice known as 'phishing' which is the illegal gathering of personal information by deception.\nFraudsters pose as a trusted source (like your bank), and try to get you to divulge your personal details.</p>\n<p>If you suspect that you have received a fraudulent email:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t click on any links or attachments, and check the sender's address.</li>\n<li>Report a phishing email that appears to be from British Airways by sending it to phishing@email.ba.com (please note that we cannot enter into correspondence over emails sent to this address, therefore you will not receive a reply)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Legitimate emails from British Airways will not have been sent from a web-based mail server such as gmail, hotmail, yahoo, etc.\nIn addition, we will never request money payments through a third party or promise you any kind of cash prize.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Here are the incidents of fraudulent emails and other phishing scams that we're currently aware of:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>September 2018:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Email sent to customers referencing the criminal theft of customer data and advising that they are entitled to full reimbursement and two free tickets from British Airways to a place of your choice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>June 2018:</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Since 21 June we have noticed fake travel booking emails are being sent form an email address that says the company is \"<strong>Travel2be</strong>\", with a Subject line: \"Thank you for your booking, XXX\" (\"XXX\" will be your first name taken from your email account registration).\nThe email is signed-off by British Airways.\nThis is not about a genuine booking - please don't reply to the message or click any links.\nThe email would typically read: 'Dear Jane Doe,&nbsp;Thank you for your booking with British Airways! We're very happy to welcome you on board on the 1st of July to Barcelona!'.\nIt continues: 'We would love to hear about your experience with our booking system and in return for your feedback we reward you with a few exclusive gifts like the newest iPhone X or a Samsung Galaxy S9.\nWe'd like to invite you to our survey of 6 short questions.'</li>\n<li>A message is circulating online, claiming to be from British Airways about naming luggage tags.\nYou can spot a scam message from spelling and grammatical errors in the text.</li>\n<li>There are some fake promotions on Whatsapp mentioning 2000/2500 free business class tickets/5000 free tickets on our flights: \"*British Airways giving freeXXXX Class Tickets.*.\nGet your free tickets at: http://www.british\u1ea1irways.com/freetickets/Enjoy?\u201d or \"Get your free ticket at: \u201chttp://www.bri\u1e6dishairways.com\".\nIf you click the link it will take you to a non-British Airways website and request personal information - a letter in the website link has a little character/dot underneath it which changes the letter and enables the link to look like one of ours, but takes you to another website.&nbsp;Therefore, do not follow these links.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Some people are receiving an email that implies they had previously made a tax-free goods order that now enables them to answer some quiz questions to win free flights from British Airways.\nThe email has been sent with a few different Subject lines:&nbsp;<strong> \"Last purchase - \" , \"Order...\", &nbsp;\"Your last purchase - \"&nbsp;,&nbsp;\"Tickets - \", or \"Duty-Free order\"</strong>.\nMost times the sender of the email is named as \"James Hiller - BA\" or&nbsp;\"Clara - British Air\".\nThese emails are not sent by us, nor have we participated in helping compile the quizzes or questionnaires&nbsp;being offered in them.</li>\n<li>An email is being sent from this email address <strong>\"travel@britishaeryways.co.uk\", with a Subject saying \"Booking confirmation\"</strong>.\nThis isn't one of our email addresses and we would recommend that you don't click any of the links in the message, or reply to the email.</li>\n<li>An email is being sent advising the person receiving it that they've won a lot of money in a promotion being operated by us.\nThe email is allegedly being sent from<strong> \"BRITISH AIRWAYS PROMOTION CLAIMS DEPARTMENT WATERSIDE\"</strong>, and is asking for some money to release the funds plus personal information.\nThis is not&nbsp;a promotion we are running.</li>\n<li>A fraudulent&nbsp;email is being sent asking people to click on attachments to view their British Airways tickets, for a journey they've not booked.\nThe email is sent from unusual email addresses, and the Subject lines we have seen are: <strong>\"Your flight order notification\", \"Flight tickets\" \"Flight order notification\", \"Canada Air\",&nbsp.\n\"Flight order\", \"Your flight order\"</strong>, etc.\nPlease do not click on any links or open any attachments.</li>\n<li>There are <strong>fake 'offers' on Facebook&nbsp;saying we're offering two free tickets</strong> to customers to celebrate our company anniversary, if you click a link to complete a survey.\nIf you're in any doubt about any offers like this you see on Facebook, please check our official Facebook profile - you can tell our official one as we have the blue circle with the white tick in it, to the right of our name.\nSimilarly, some people have received a 'Whatsapp' message saying that British Airways are giving away free tickets for our anniversary celebrations, and asking the recipient to complete a survey to be entered into the draw.\nAgain, this isn't an offer we're running - sorry!</li>\n<li>Finally, some people are receiving emails inviting them to enter a<strong> competition to become a \"mystery shopper\"</strong>, or to win large amounts of holiday vouchers by completing a survey - we're sorry to disappoint you but these aren't real competitions.</li>\n<li>Some people are receiving emails from a fake email address \"flights@britishairways.com\" with a Subject Line <strong>\"Voucher #57487 - 2 free flights\"</strong>.\n&nbsp;Also look out for \"Travel Reservation for xxx\" / Travel Confirmation - #115157487\" or \"Travel Confirmation for xxx\"&nbsp;(the \"xxx\" will match the part of your email address before the \"@\" symbol).\nIn the main section of the email it refers to \"Travel Confirmation - (#115157487)\".\nThis isn't a legitimate British Airways promotion and we didn't send you the message.)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>There are also other fake emails offering vouchers toward holidays or flights with us, in exchange for clicking a link and providing personal information.\nThe Subject line is usually \"Choose your destination\" or \"Where to next?\" Again, this isn't an offer we're aware of and your personal information could be in danger if you follow these links.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>10.Several people have reported receiving WhatsApp messages making reference to accessing a link for a voucher to use for BA flights.\nWe don't use WhatsApp as a channel to send out promotions or offers and this isn't an offer we're involved&nbsp;in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>April 2017:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1) Some people are receiving emails from a fake email address \"flights@britishairways.com\" with a Subject Line \"Voucher #57487 - 2 free flights\".\n&nbsp;Also look out for <strong>\"Travel Reservation for xxx\" / Travel Confirmation - #115157487\" or \"Travel Confirmation for xxx\"</strong> (the \"xxx\" will match the part of your email address before the \"@\" symbol).\nIn the main section of the email it refers to \"Travel Confirmation - (#115157487)\".\nThis isn't a legitimate British Airways promotion and we didn't send you the message.</p>\n<p>2) There are also other fake emails offering vouchers toward holidays or flights with us, in exchange for clicking a link and providing personal information.\nThe Subject line is usually \"Choose your destination\" or \"Where to next?\" Again, this isn't an offer we're aware of and your personal information could be in danger if you follow these links.</p>\n<p>3) Several people have reported receiving WhatsApp messages making reference to accessing a link for a voucher to use for BA flights.\nWe don't use WhatsApp as a channel to send out promotions or offers and this isn't an offer we're involved in.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>November 2016:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>1) An email is being sent out with the subject line \"Your Order #27395739 / 24&nbsp;November&nbsp;2016\" or \"Your Order #13847935 / 24&nbsp;November&nbsp;2016\" (the date might change).\nThe message is from tickets.BA@email.ba.air.com and refers to the booking reference \"3OWJ13\".\nThis email was not sent by British&nbsp;Airways.\nIf you have a concern whether a booking you receive an email about is legitimate, you can check via Manage My Booking.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>August 2016:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1) Facebook-related fake British Airways pages with offers for free First class flight tickets (sometimes with hotel stays too).\nMost mention it's because of our 40th or 42nd birthday.\nWe're sorry but this isn't an offer we're running and it's not from our legitimate/official British Airways Facebook page.</p>\n<p>2) Some people have reported receiving an email with this subject line: \"British Airways - You won a 10,000 miles flying card / Promo #99993392\".\nThe message refers to offering a gift card with the value 399 GBP.\nPlease do not click the link nor reply to the email.\nThis email was not sent by British Airways.</p>\n<p>3) There are additional emails being sent offering non-existent vouchers for the amounts of 2,500 GBP, 1,000 GBP or \u00a31,000.\nThese emails have a few different subject lines, including references to \u201cfree flights\u201d or \u201ctravel discounts\u201d or \u201ccomplimentary flights\u201d.\nAgain, these emails were not sent by us and the email address is not one British Airways would use.\nIf you hover&nbsp;your cursor&nbsp;over any links in the email, you will see that these&nbsp;do not&nbsp;direct to ba.com.&nbsp;Our logo is also being used fradulently in these instances.</p>\n<p>4) An email is being sent out with a subject line: \"Your e-ticket receipt 1TKG86: LHR-JFK 30 Sep 2016\".\nIt is then referring to the following booking reference and payment amount: \"Thanks for the purchase! Booking number: 1TKG86 - Your credit card has been charged for $691.62.\" This booking doesn't exist and you haven't been charged by British Airways.</p>\n<p>5) Some people have received an email referring to booking number \"BRAIR-12586-GB\".\nThis reference doesn't exist, nor is there a travel package to win.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>March-May 2016:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We're aware of fraudulent \"WhatsApp\" or text messages that tell you there is a package/suitcase/letter in your name that is very valuable (although you had no idea about this parcel/package until you received this message) and which needs you to pay some money to 'release' it from British Airways World Cargo.\nUsually the people sending these message ask for the money to be sent through a company such as Western Union, or another money-sender.\nBritish Airways or IAG Cargo would not pass customers items to a third party to arrange repatriation.\nWe would not collect any fees/charges in this way.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>April 2016:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>An email with the subject line \"E-ticket confirmation\" has been mailed out, referring to a fake e-ticket number \"549843215952132\" and a ticket price \"2216.45 GBP\".\nThis email was not sent by us, and this ticket does not exist.</p>\nFind out about scam emails on the Get Safe Online website <small>\n</small>Purchasing <ul>\n<li>Look for

will not be able to cancel your booking or obtain a refund of any charges you have paid.</p>\n<small>\n</small>Who do we share your personal information with? <p>Your personal information may be

you have provided your consent to those companies.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose your personal information to the following third parties for the purpose described here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customs and immigration authorities of any country in your itinerary or to which your flight may fly over.\nBritish&nbsp;Airways and other airlines are required by laws in the UK, USA and other countries to give border control agencies and customs authorities access to booking and travel information when you fly to and from countries including stop-overs and where you may overfly countries to your destination.\nShow example <ul>\n<li>Further information about Government access to British&nbsp;Airways booking records (English only).</li>\n<li>Further information about Passports, visas and API (Advanced Passenger Information).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Airlines and other service providers needed to deliver the services you have asked for where, for instance, part of your travel itinerary involves a flight operated by a different airline or includes car hire or a hotel booking.\nThose airlines and other service providers will be identified when you make a booking.\nShow example</li>\n<li>If you have joined the Executive&nbsp;Club or another affiliated loyalty program, our partners in the Executive&nbsp;Club and other loyalty schemes that you have joined so that we can administer the benefits of the loyalty programme to you.</li>\n<li>Credit and charge card companies, credit reference agencies and anti-fraud screening service providers to process payments and

is with British&nbsp;Airways Holidays (or they are providing parts of your package) as set out in British&nbsp;Airways Holidays Terms and Conditions, your personal information is provided to both British&nbsp;Airways Plc and British&nbsp;Airways Holidays Limited.</p>\n<p>We do not sell personal information to third parties, and we only allow third parties to send you marketing information where we have your consent to do so.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nWhat countries will your personal information be sent to?<p>Your personal information may be sent to and stored by us and third parties in countries outside the country in which you are located and outside the European Economic Area and the UK.</p>\n<p>The nature of our business means it is often necessary for us to send your personal information outside the European Economic Area or the UK to fulfil your travel arrangements.\nThis occurs because our business and the third parties identified in \u2019Who do we share your personal information with?\u2019 have operations in countries across the world.\nFor example, where you are flying outside of the European Economic Area or the UK, your personal information will be transferred to border control and immigration outside of these territories.</p>\n<p>In addition, we may transfer your data to parties in countries outside the country in which you are located to provide services to us.</p>\n<p>This may involve sending your data to countries where under their local laws you may have fewer legal rights.</p>\n<p>Where your personal information is transferred outside the European Economic Area or the UK because we are using a service provider in a third country, we will implement safeguards so that your personal information continues to be protected to the standards set out in this privacy policy.</p>\n<p>If you would like more information on these safeguards, please contact the Data Protection Officer, British&nbsp;Airways Plc, Waterside (HCB3), PO Box 365, Harmondsworth,

exercise your legal rights and change how we use your data? </p>\n<p>Your rights include the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You may request us to stop sending you marketing.\nTo see how to change your
