Act</strong>\n</p>\n<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.\nThe law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California

privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.\n\u2013 See more at:

by data processors.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives
