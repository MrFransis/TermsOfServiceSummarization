the sale of Information</li>\n<li>Deletion of Information</li>\n<li>Access and portability of Information collected</li>\n<li>Non-discrimination</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Exercising Your Rights, Verification, and Timing.</b> To exercise your CCPA rights, click on the \u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Info\u201d link on the bottom of the Website page where we collect Information, or send an email to help@myprivacyrequest.com.\nTo prevent an unauthorized third party from accessing or making decisions regarding a user\u2019s Information, we verify all requests to exercise these rights (a verifiable consumer request).\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or abusive.<br>In general, we will verify a request by matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the Information we already have for the user.\nIf we cannot verify the user using the foregoing method, we may request additional information, which we will not retain or use for any other purpose.<br>For all verifiable consumer requests, we strive to respond within forty-five (45) days of receipt.\nIf we require additional time, which can be up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate, we will provide written notice.\nAny disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt and will be delivered electronically in a secure fashion.\nIf, for some reason, we cannot fulfill or comply with your request, our response will explain that decision.&nbsp;<br>\n<b>Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold.</b> While users have the right to request different levels of disclosure regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and sale of Information, we have elected to treat all requests from California residents as an exercise of expanded disclosure requests by businesses that sell Information.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you for the 12 months prior to your request:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>The categories and sources of Information collected;</li>\n<li>Our business and commercial purposes for collecting and selling that Information;</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties with whom we shared that Information;</li>\n<li>The specific pieces of Information collected;</li>\n<li>If we sold or disclosed your

of your Information.&nbsp.\nWe reserve the right to verify all opt-out requests using the methods described above.&nbsp;<br>While our agreements with third parties to whom we sell or disclose Information prohibit the further sale or use beyond the scope of our agreement with them, if a California user opts-out, we will notify all third parties to whom we have sold or disclosed the California user\u2019s Information within the previous 90 days and remind them not to further sell the Information.\nWe will not ask a California user who has opted out to re-opt-in for one year after the California user opts-out.\nIf the user requests a transaction with us that requires the sale of their Information, we will inform them that they have opted out and if they want to proceed with the transaction, we will offer the opportunity to opt-in by completing a two-step process.<br>\n<b>Deletion of Information</b>.\nYou have the right to request that we delete any of your Information that we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request using the process set forth above, we will delete or deidentify (and direct our service providers, vendors, and other applicable third parties to delete) your Information from our system other than from our archive servers (which we maintain for compliance purposes), unless there is an applicable exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>We may decline to process your deletion request if the Information is necessary for us or our service providers, vendors, or other applicable third parties for a number of reasons.\nFor example, we may decline your deletion request if the Information is required to:<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the Information or provide the goods or services you requested;</li>\n<li>Detect security incidents, protect, investigate and respond to malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;</li>\n<li>Identify and correct errors that negatively impact intended functionality.\nand</li>\n<li>Comply with a legal obligation, including Federal and/or State tax liability and

customer support ticket.\nWe may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer during this process.\nIf we provide you with a final written settlement offer and you don't accept it, if we can't otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, or if you choose to skip this step, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in the county where you live by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration online by following the instructions at https://apps.adr.org/webfile/.</p>\n<p>An AAA arbitrator will have exclusive

address, contact us by clicking here.</p>\n<p>Either party may submit the dispute for resolution by arbitration at a location reasonably convenient to both parties.\nIf either party files for arbitration, it will be conducted in accordance with the then current AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you proceed to arbitration against us, you will pay all AAA filing fees and we will pay for all administration and arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nFor claims brought by you of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone, or based only on submissions.\nThe arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable relief, including injunctive relief.\nAny award will be final and conclusive to the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nIf you initiate arbitration against us and the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our final written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then we will pay you a minimum recovery of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), plus we will reimburse any reasonable expenses incurred by your attorney, if any, including fees reasonably accrued for investigating, preparing, and pursuing the claim in arbitration.\nAlthough under some laws we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we agree

claims as provided above.</p>\n<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, VIA YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS, YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AS WELL AS YOUR RIGHT TO BRING, JOIN,
