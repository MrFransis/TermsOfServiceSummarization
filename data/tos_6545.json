name to a website of our choosing) until such time as you elect to supply the name-server information.\nAny newly registered domain names will default to using our name-servers.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THE ACCOUNT AND WHOIS CONTACT INFORMATION: <ol>\n<li> If, in obtaining Services, you provide information about or on behalf of a third party, you represent and warrant that you have (a) provided notice to that third party of the disclosure and use of that party's information as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) obtained the third

information within seven (7) days of any change, or failure to respond for over fifteen (15) days to inquiries concerning the accuracy of contact details associated with your registration, failing to immediately update information or engaging in any Illegal Uses will constitute an incurable material breach of this Agreement.\nYour failure to respond for over three (3) calendar days to inquiries by

is your duty to safeguard your Account login identifier and password from any unauthorized use.\nAny person in possession of your Account login identifier and password will have both the ability and your authorization to modify your Account and domain name information, initiate transfers of your domain name(s) to other registrars, initiate registrant changes to your domain names which may terminate your rights to use such domain name(s), update DNS changes to your domain name(s) which may result in changes to the content associated with your domain name(s) and take other actions which may affect or terminate your rights and access to your domain name(s) and/or the Services.\n</li>\n<li> We will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information and such reasonable precautions include procedures for releasing Account access information to parties who claim to have lost Account access information.\nIf we take reasonable precautions in relation thereto, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE IF SUCH REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS DO NOT PREVENT THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD AND, EVEN IF WE FAIL TO TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS, OUR LIABILITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION FOUND IN PARAGRAPH 13 BELOW IN THIS AGREEMENT.\n</li>\n<li> If you contact us alleging that a third party has unauthorized access to your Account or domain names, we may charge you administrative fees, currently set at \u00a375 (Great British Pounds) per hour, for our time spent in relation to the matter, regardless of whether or not we return control over the Account and/or domain name(s) to you.\nYou will indemnify us for any reasonable attorneys' fees and costs we may incur in relation to the matter, even if those fees and costs accrue as a result of defending an action, or responding to a threat of an action, initiated by You or a third party.\n</li>\n<li> You have the ability to create Sub-User accounts as well.\nThese Sub-User accounts allow the people you designate to access certain functionality, including those listed in section c(i) above.\nYou have the option of configuring each Sub-User account to have access to any stored payment profiles as well as to set an expiration date representing the revocation of that Sub-User's ability to access your account.\nYou are entirely responsible for any changes requested or made by any Sub-Users you create, and in no event will we be responsible for any undesirable impact to you as a result of any such changes.\n</li>\n<li> You are responsible for ensuring your beneficiaries have appropriate access to your Amethyst Hosting account(s) in the event of your death or disability.\nWe strongly encourage all account holders to treat their domains like other important assets and to therefore implement a plan of succession upon their inability to access their account.\nFailure to make the necessary provisions to ensure your beneficiaries have access to your applicable Amethyst Hosting account(s) before your death or disability may make accessing your account (including, but not limited to, account funds balance, domain names and sale proceeds) impossible.\nPlease be sure to also consider optional account security usage such as 2-Factor Authentication and Domain Defender.\nIt is also very important that your account information match documentation we may receive in the event of your death such as a death certificate.\nWhile we may attempt to work with your beneficiaries to gain access to your account and associated account assets, this is at our sole discretion.\nIt is very difficult in many cases to prove important issues concerning the rightful access to accounts by beneficiaries, and our first priority is the privacy and security of our account holders.\nIn the event we are able to work with a beneficiary to grant account access, we reserve the right to lock domains for a period of time to be solely determined by us.\nThis lock may include, among other things, preventing changes, preventing transfer to a different registrar and preventing transfer to a different account.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> SHARING OF WHOIS INFORMATION: <ol>\n<li> We will make available the domain name registration information you provide or that we otherwise maintain to the following parties: ICANN, any ICANN-authorized escrow service, the registry administrator(s), and to other third parties as ICANN, registry administrators and applicable laws may require or permit (including through web-based and other on-line WHOIS lookup systems), whether during or after the term of your domain name registration services of the domain name.\nYou irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from such disclosure or use of such information.\nWe may make publicly available, or directly available to third parties, some, or all, of the information you provide, for purposes of inspection (such as through our WHOIS service) or for targeted marketing and other purposes as required or permitted by applicable laws, including by way of bulk WHOIS data access provided to third parties who enter into a bulk WHOIS data access agreement with us.\nWe reserve the right to discontinue providing bulk WHOIS data access to third parties.\n</li>\n<li> ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that we may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available.\nInformation regarding ICANN's guidelines and requirements regarding WHOIS can be found at http://www.icann.org/registrars/wmrp.htm, http://www.icann.org/registrars/wdrp.htm, and elsewhere on the ICANN website at http://www.icann.org/.\n</li>\n<li> You consent to the data processing referred to above.\n</li>\n<li> We will not process the Personal Data collected from you in a way incompatible with the purposes and other limitations about which we provided notice to you within our terms.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> OUR SERVICES: <ol>\n<li> DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION.\n<ol>\n<li> We are accredited registrars with ICANN for generic Top Level Domain Names (\"gTLDs\") (such as .com, .net, .org, etc.).\nICANN oversees registrations and other aspects of the gTLDs.\nDomain name registrations are not effective until the registry administrator puts them into effect.\nDomain name registrations are only for limited terms which end on the expiration date.\nFor domain names which are created as a new registration out of the pool of available domain names, the term begins on the date the domain name registration is acknowledged by the applicable registry.\nFor domain name registrations which were not returned to the pool of available domain names, the term begins on the date the previous registrant's domain name registration was acknowledged by the applicable registry.\n</li>\n<li> We are not liable or responsible in any way for any errors, omissions or any other actions by the registry administrator arising out of or related to a request to register, renew, modify the settings for, or transfer of a domain name registration.\nYou acknowledge that domain name registration is a service, domain name registrations do not exist independently from services provided pursuant to this or a similar registration agreement with a registrar, domain name registration services do not create a property interest and you have no such property interest in any domain name(s) which you may register with us.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> NOT INCLUDED IN THE DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION SERVICES: <ol>\n<li> We are not responsible to determine whether the domain name(s) you select, or the use you or others make of the domain name(s), or other use of the Services, infringes legal rights of others.\nIt is your responsibility to know whether or not the domain name(s) you select or use or allow others to use infringe legal rights of others.\n</li>\n<li> We might be ordered by a court or arbitrator to cancel, modify, or transfer your domain name.\nit is your responsibility to list accurate contact information in association with your Account and to communicate with litigants, potential litigants, and governmental authorities.\nIt is not our responsibility to forward court orders or other communications to you.\nOur policy is to comply with court orders from courts of competent jurisdiction as well as UDRP Panel decisions.\nIf you contact us informing us that you are contesting a court order from a court of competent jurisdiction, we may, but are not obligated to, place a transfer lock on the domain name pending the outcome of the dispute.\nIf you contact us informing us that you are contesting an adverse UDRP Panel decision, your time limits and procedures to do so are subject to the requirements set forth in the UDRP.\nWe may, but are not obligated to, delay implementation of a UDRP Panel decision based solely on your informing us that you intend to contest the decision.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> WHOIS PRIVACY: We offer a privacy service which substitutes your information with our default information within WHOIS.\nIn the event that you select to utilize this WHOIS Privacy service for one or more of your domains, the following applies: <ol>\n<li> The information you submit related to the various domain roles (registrant, administrative, technical and billing) will remain associated with the domain at all times.\nWe make no claims to the ownership or management of your domains when selecting to use our WHOIS Privacy service.\n</li>\n<li> The terms of this Agreement related to your responsibilities to maintain the accuracy of your contact information are not altered or waived due to your use of this service.\n</li>\n<li> We will provide information to WHOIS at our discretion which will hide your information.\nThis information may reference a WHOIS privacy service other than our name.\n</li>\n<li> You authorize us, or the party referenced in the WHOIS record for your domains utilizing this service, to discard any and all postal mail and electronic mail addressed to the address provided in WHOIS.\nWe are not responsible for forwarding any correspondence directed to your domain names.\nWe will provide a mechanism for entities to make contact with you via a web page that will be referenced in the private WHOIS records.\nIt is entirely at our discretion to forward none, some or all of the correspondence directed to you.\nWe also provide a mechanism for you to enter the email address you would like to use to receive email addressed to the email address in WHOIS for your private domains.\nWe will use our best efforts to forward any such email to the address you provide, but we make no guarantee that we will be able to do so.\nYou agree to provide an email address that complies with the rest of our terms or terms imposed by ICANN or the respective domain registries.\n</li>\n<li> You represent and warrant that your use of the WHOIS privacy service will be in good faith and that none of the content found on any web sites or IP addresses associated with domains utilizing the WHOIS privacy service infringes upon the legal rights of any third-party (including, but not limited to, any third-party's trademark, trade name or copyrighted material), and that none of the content is, or is connected to, terrorism, impersonation of a third-party, illegal activities or the transmission of spam, viruses, trojan horses or any other harmful routine or data.\n</li>\n<li> WHOIS privacy is not available for .us domains.\n</li>\n<li> The \"AGENTS AND LICENSES\" policies covered below also apply to your use of WHOIS Privacy.\n</li>\n<li> We reserve the right in our sole judgment to suspend, terminate and/or disclose your personal information in the event that any of the following occur: <ol>\n<li> Any provision of this Agreement is breached </li>\n<li> If necessary to comply with applicable laws, subpoenas, court orders, a UDRP action or action initiated by any other entity with appropriate jurisdiction </li>\n<li> If we deem that continuing to provide WHOIS privacy services places us in any jeopardy of of harm including financial loss or legal liability on our behalf or on the behalf of any of our partners, affiliates, employees or managers </li>\n<li> If we believe you have not completely abided by your representations and warranties listed in this Agreement </li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> In the event that we or a third-party believe you to be infringing upon any part of this Agreement, we will contact you at the email address associated with your account.\nIt is your responsibility to reply to any such communication within three (3) days.\nWe are not responsible for any failure to deliver any such notification as things beyond our control may occur that could prevent delivery.\nIf you fail to reply within the given time frame, or if, in our sole judgment, we believe your reply does not adequately address the points raised in our email, we reserve the right to immediately release your contact information and to suspend or terminate the WHOIS privacy service.\nThis would result in your information being made available via WHOIS.\nYou further agree that we disclaim any liability arising out of undertaking this action and any direct or indirect consequences experienced as a result of releasing your information or suspending or terminating the WHOIS privacy service.\n</li>\n<li> In addition to all other indemnity clauses in this Agreement, you agree to defend, release, and indemnify us, ICANN, the registry operators as well as any of our employees, agents, affiliates, partners and managers for any third-party claims arising out of your usage of the WHOIS privacy services.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> SERVICES PROVIDED AT WILL.\nTERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF SERVICES: <ol>\n<li> We may reject your domain name registration application or elect to discontinue providing Services to you for any reason within 30 days of a Service initiation or a Service renewal.\nOutside of this period, we may terminate or suspend the Services at any time for cause, which, without limitation, includes (i) registration of prohibited domain name(s), (ii) abuse of the Services, (iii) payment irregularities, (iv) illegal conduct, (v) failure to keep your Account or WHOIS information accurate and up to date, (vi) failure to respond to inquiries from us for over three (3) calendar days, (vii) if your use of the Services involves us in a violation of any third party's rights or acceptable use policies, including but not limited to the transmission of unsolicited email, the violation of any copyright, or the distribution of any form of malware (defined to include, without limitation, malicious code or software that might affect the operation of the Internet), (viii) to comply with any applicable court orders, laws, government rules or requirements, requests of law enforcement or other governmental agency or organization, or any dispute resolution process, (ix) to avoid any liability, civil or criminal, on the part of us, as, well as its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, and employees, (x) to protect the integrity, security and stability of the Domain Name system (DNS), or (xi) failure to respond to inquiries from us regarding payment inquiries for over 24 hours.\nProhibited domain names and illegal activities which may be subject to these provisions include, but are not limited to: <ol>\n<li> Domains and web sites prohibited by the laws of the United Kingdom and/or foreign territories in which you conduct business </li>\n<li> Domains and web sites designed to encourage unlawful behavior by others, such as hate crimes, terrorism and child pornography </li>\n<li> Domains and web sites that

REFUNDS WILL NOT BE ISSUED IF YOUR SERVICES ARE SUSPENDED FOR CAUSE PER THIS AGREEMENT.<br>\n<br> If we determine that your account is engaged in repeated abuse of this Agreement then we may elect to terminate your entire account and all services within your account.\n</li>\n<li> You may cancel any domain registration (other than domains registered via drop-catching) with us within two (2) days (48 Hours) of purchase for a full refund (minus any applicable transaction fees).\nYou may cancel at any time after the two-day period, but no refund will be issued.\nYour refund will be issued back to the method of payment used to make the registration purchase.\nThe total refund amount may be reduced by any transaction fees that we incurred as part of the initial transaction and/or the issuance of the refund.\nAll refunds will go back to the source of the transaction.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Important note regarding domain registration refunds.</strong> At our sole discretion, we may choose not to issue a domain registration refund if we believe you to be engaged in \"domain tasting\" or some other activity resulting in an abnormal number of cancellations.\nMore specifically, if, in our sole discretion, we believe you to be engaged in a high volume or irregular number of registrations and subsequent cancellations, we may opt not to refund your money.\nIn the event we believe you to be engaged in such activity, we will make an effort to issue one warning via email to you prior to disallowing further refunds for your account, but we are not obligated to do so.<br>\n<br> Domain Name Renewals or Transfers are not eligible to receive a refund.\n</li>\n<li> If we terminate or suspend the Services provided to you under this Agreement, we may then, at our option, make either ourselves or a third party the beneficiary of Services which are substantially similar to those which were previously provided to you.\nIf we have grounds to terminate or suspend Services with respect to one domain name or in relation to other Services provided through your Account, we may terminate or suspend all Services provided through your Account.\nNo fee refund will be made when there is a suspension or termination of Services for cause.\n</li>\n<li> At any time and for any reason, we may terminate the Services thirty (30) days after we send notice of termination via mail or email, at our option, to the WHOIS contact information provided in association with your domain name registration.\nFollowing notice of termination other than for cause, you must transfer your domain name within such thirty (30) day notice period or risk that we may delete your domain name, transfer the registration services associated with your domain name to ourselves or a third party, or suspend or modify Services related to your domain name.\nIf we terminate Services for a reason other than cause, we will provide a pro-rata refund of your fees.\n</li>\n<li> Your registration of a domain name is subject to suspension, cancellation or transfer by any ICANN procedure now in affect or which may come into affect at a later date, by any registrar or registry administrator procedures approved by an ICANN-adopted policy or any policy adopted by any ccTLD registry or governing body, to correct mistakes by us, another registrar or the registry administrator in administering the domain name or for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name or as a result of any government decree, rule, law or regulation.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, ICANN's WHOIS ACCURACY PROGRAM SPECIFICATION which requires that we deactivate any domains for which we have not received verification of Registrant email address within 15 days of notification.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> FEES: You agree to pay, prior to the effectiveness of the desired Services, the applicable Service fees set forth during the registration process or otherwise communicated to you by us.\nIn the event any of the fees for Services change, we will use reasonable efforts to give you thirty (30) days prior notice of such a change.\nAll fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your then current registration term, unless this Agreement specifically provides for a refund.\nAt our option, we may require that you pay fees through a particular payment means (such as by credit card or by wire transfer) or that you change from one payment provider to another.\n</li>\n<li> PAYMENT ISSUES: In the event of a charge back, or if we have belief in an imminent charge back, by a credit card company, credit card holder, or similar action by another payment provider, including, but not limited to PayPal, Payza or Skrill investigations, allowed by us in connection with your payment of fees for any Services, we may suspend access to any and all Accounts you have with us and all interests in and use of any domain name registration services.\nWe may cancel any order(s) associated with anything covered in this section, but may not provide a refund.\nWe may reinstate your rights to and control over these Services solely at our discretion, and potentially subject to our receipt of the unpaid fees and our then-current reinstatement fee as otherwise communicated to you by us.\nIf you have an issue with credit card or other payment charges, you should contact us regarding the issue before you contact your credit card or other payment process company to request a charge back or reversal of the charges.\n</li>\n<li> EXPIRATION AND RENEWAL OF SERVICES: It is your responsibility to keep your own records and to maintain your own reminders regarding when your domain name registration or other Services are set to expire and to maintain current and accurate credit card information should any Services be placed on \"auto-renew.\" As a convenience to you, and not as a binding commitment, we may notify you via an email message or via your Account when renewal fees are due.\nShould these fees go unpaid, your Services will expire or be cancelled.\nPayment must be made by credit card, account funds, Paypal, or such other method as we may allow or require from time to time.\nIf you select automatic renewal of the Services, we may attempt to renew the Services a reasonable time before expiration, provided your billing information is available and up to date.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your billing information up to date and we are not required to, but may, contact you to update this information in the event that an attempted transaction is not processed successfully.\n</li>\n<li> TRANSFERS: <ol>\n<li> Transfer of your domain name(s) services shall be governed by ICANN's transfer policy, available at http://www.icann.org/transfers/, including the Registrar Transfer Dispute Resolution Policy, available at https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en as well as the UDRP as described in the Dispute Resolution Policy of this Agreement, as these policies may be modified from time to time.\nTo transfer your domain name(s) you should first login to your Account to lock or unlock your domain name(s) and/or to obtain the EPP \"AuthCode\" which is required to transfer domain services in an EPP registry (such as .org).\nOnly the registrant and the administrative contacts listed in the WHOIS information may approve or deny a transfer request.\nWithout limitation, domain name services may not be transferred within 60 days of initial registration, within 60 days of a transfer, if there is a dispute regarding the identity of the domain name registrant, if you are bankrupt, or if you fail to pay fees when due.\nWe will follow the procedures for both gaining and losing registrars as outlined in ICANN's transfer policies.\nA transfer will not be processed if, during this time, the domain name registration services expire, in which event you may need to reinstate the transfer request following a redemption of the domain name, if any.\nYou may be required to resubmit a transfer request if there is a communication failure or other problem at either our end or at the registry.\nYOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR FAILURE OF A TRANSFER WHETHER OR NOT THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS INITIATED CLOSE TO THE END OF A REGISTRATION TERM.\n</li>\n<li> We may place a \"Registrar Lock\" on your domain name services and this will prevent your domain name services from being transferred without your authorization, though we are not required to do so.\nBy allowing your domain name services to remain locked, you provide express objection to any and all transfer requests until the lock is removed.\n</li>\n<li> You may cancel incoming transfer requests at any time before they are completed up to 29 calendar days from the initial transfer order.\nCanceling a transfer request will entitle you to a refund of the transfer cost, minus processing fees.\nYOU WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO A REFUND IF YOU CANCEL YOUR TRANSFER REQUEST AFTER THE 29 DAY TIME LIMIT.\n</li>\n<li> In the event we receive a request from a different registrar to transfer your domain away, you may be presented with an option to approve the transfer without waiting the standard 5-7 days for registry release.\nAny such approval grants us the right to approve the transfer immediately.\nWe also reserve the right to approve outbound transfers at any time during the transfer process.\n</li>\n<li> Certain transfers may not be eligible for the 1-year extension associated with most transfers.\nFor example, domains renewed within 45 days of transfer or domains already registered for more than 9 years will not get extended by a year upon transfer completion.\nRegistries apply the extra year, registrars do not.\nTherefore, if the registry is unable to extend the expiration by a year, then one year will not be added to your domain transfer.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> DNS SERVICES: The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical naming system built on a distributed database for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network.\nIt associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.\nMost importantly, it translates domain names meaningful to humans into the numerical identifiers associated with networking equipment for the purpose of locating and addressing these devices worldwide.<br> As a convenience to our customers, we offer DNS hosting service with all domain registrations.\nUse of this service is entirely optional.\nYou may opt to use another DNS service provider at any time by associating different authoritative name servers with the applicable domains as needed.\nBy using the DNS service we offer, you hereby acknowledge and agree to the following: <ol>\n<li> DNS is a critical service responsible for all facets of domain use.\nIncorrect configuration of DNS as it relates to your domains can lead to problems such as: <ol>\n<li> Web site(s) not loading </li>\n<li> Email can stop working </li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> You should only make DNS modifications if you fully understand the implications of doing so, understand how DNS works, have the technical expertise to verify the modifications were propagated properly to the associated authoritative name servers, and are prepared to fully test the impact of the modifications as soon as they take effect.\n</li>\n<li> We make absolutely no guarantee whatsoever related to the DNS hosting service.\nIf you need a service level agreement guaranteeing minimum performance or reliability levels, you should use a different DNS service provider who offers such guarantees.\n</li>\n<li> DNS is a globally distributed database with many interconnected components - the vast majority of which are NOT directly or indirectly under our control.\nProblems can occur anywhere in the system.\n</li>\n<li> Many of the distributed nodes in DNS, commonly referred to as recursive resolvers, cache DNS resource records for the time recommended by our authoritative name servers (controlled via the TTL value), or for any amount of time they are configured to do so (they can ignore our recommended time).\nAs a result, changes made to DNS records through us will not immediately propagate to your local systems - the delay can be as long as the maximum TTL setting on the associated records, or longer.\n</li>\n<li> We, at our sole discretion, reserve the right to provide additional support for DNS related matters, or no support at all.\n</li>\n<li> Upon domain deletion, domain expiration, transfer of a domain (away from us), and/or the cancellation/termination/suspension/deletion of your account(s), DNS service for the associated domain(s) and/or account(s) will be terminated.\nIt is entirely your responsibility to make alternative DNS service arrangements prior and/or after termination of DNS service as needed if said termination could affect you in any way.\n</li>\n<li> We, at our sole discretion, reserve the right
