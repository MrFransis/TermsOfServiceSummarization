"//div[@id='policy-etiquette']", "text": " Introduction\n<p>DeviantArt is an expansive, worldwide community of artists of every age, and every nationality who create works spanning every medium, every subject and every level of talent and skill.</p>\n<p>As the guiding force of this large and vibrant community we have two primary and often conflicting goals in the service we provide for you, the members of the community.\nthe first being to ensure that members are free to express themselves within reason with as few restrictions as possible while nurturing an environment of creativity, learning, and talent and the second is to protect the members of the community, to the best of our abilities, from infringement of copyright, discrimination, harassment, and prejudice.</p>\n<p>All members of the DeviantArt community are expected to be familiar with these rules of etiquette and they will be enforced evenly and without bias in every situation which is brought to the attention of the administration regardless of the membership status of the user in question.\n</p> Guidelines for Deviants.\nQuality and Placement\n<p>It is our policy to welcome artists of all levels from amateur to professional and to that end we do not attach any minimum standards of quality to deviations submitted by our membership.\nall manner of artworks are welcome providing they meet with our etiquette and copyright policies.\nWhile we do not impose quality standards we do ask that you practice self-moderation in what you choose to submit and that you submit your works into the most appropriate gallery.\nWhile we encourage the submission of only your very best works we have provided an area for those submissions which may fall short of that 'top quality' mark.\nthis is your \"Scrapbook\" gallery and we highly encourage its use.</p>\n<p>Our community volunteers may elect to move one or more of your deviations from the Gallery categories into a different, more appropriate, section or into the Scrapbook category.\nwe ask that you accept this decision gracefully and with a mature attitude.\nIf you desire a full explanation for this action, or if you feel the administrative action was performed in error, you should submit an inquiry to the official DeviantArt Helpdesk and include a link to the relevant deviation.\nPlease do not bring these issues into the Forums, userpages, or other areas of DeviantArt.</p> Prohibited Commentary\n<p>\n<em>Prohibited commentary is typically considered to be inherently disrespectful, aggressive, or otherwise abusive.\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>We must insist that you refrain from comments which are racist, bigoted, or which otherwise offensively target a philosophy or religion.\nIn addition we ask that our members avoid making offensive remarks based on gender or sexual preference and that you do not make any remark, comment or critique which is intended to be a direct insult to an individual, group, or genre of artwork.\nHate propaganda is met with zero tolerance.\nComments which are overly aggressive, personally insulting or needlessly abusive are also prohibited.</p>\n<p>If you feel that you have been the target of harassment, personal insults or other severe behavior please notify the staff by using the official DeviantArt helpdesk.\nPlease be aware that the staff will only directly intervene in cases which are considered severe.\nminor situations may be dealt with using tools made available to all registered members.</p>\nDiscouraged Commentary\n<p>\n<em>Discouraged commentary is typically considered to have the potential to escalate into an aggressive or abusive situation.</em>\n</p>\n<p>While not strictly prohibited we must insist that all personal arguments, disagreements, and other volatile \"personal\" issues within be confined to private communications such as Notes, emails, or Instant Messaging programs.\nLikewise we discourage public accusations and other similar situations.\nplease bring all issues of this nature to the attention of the staff by notifying the official DeviantArt helpdesk.</p> Exploitive Commentary\n<p>\n<em>Exploitive commentary is typically considered to be disruptive due to unusual or unique factors.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Do not 'spam' (send large numbers of identical notes or comments).\nSpamming is obnoxious and is typically used for self-promotion, or other unwanted advertising.</p>\n<p>Do not 'flood' (place large numbers of comments rapidly on a single page or craft a single comment which consumes a large amount of page space) the forums, notes system, userpages or other areas of the site.\nFlooding usually disrupts page loading times and serves no useful purpose.\n</p>\nRespect Your Fellow Artists\n<p>As a vibrant and growing art community DeviantArt welcomes all kinds of original artworks.\nbut we <strong>MUST</strong> insist that the artwork which you submit be your own original works.</p>\n<p>Your deviations <strong>must</strong> be your own original creations and you may only use resources which are considered legitimate and legal.\nSubmissions which make use of works without proper permission or licensing by the original author will be removed as they come to the attention of the staff.\nThis policy applies to all Deviation submissions, Scrapbook entries, and the preview images used for written submissions.</p>\n<p>If you have reason to believe that a DeviantArt submission violates this policy you should use the official <strong>Report Violation</strong> link which is available on every submission page.</p>\nMature Content\n<p>When we discuss <em>mature content</em> we are specifically referring to deviations which contain images, subject matter, or other themes which some viewers may find offensive, distasteful, or otherwise undesirable to view or to read.\nThe most common 'undesired' viewing material may include, but is not limited to, images containing artistic nudity (see details below), large amounts of simulated blood and gore, or generally violent themes.</p>\n<p>DeviantArt <strong>strictly prohibits</strong> the submission of materials classified as pornographic or obscene.\nThere is no exception to this prohibition.</p>\n<p>Certain content may be deemed <em>obscene</em> by the administration and as such the staff reserves the right to remove such content immediately upon discovery.\nThe administration reserves the sole right to review and classify questionable material as obscene or not obscene.</p> Model release forms\n<p>The DeviantArt administrative staff reserves the right to demand a Model Release form be provided for any photography (nude or otherwise) located within either your Gallery or Scrapbook areas.\nIn the event that you receive such a request an appropriate link will be included in the notification you received.\nFailure to properly respond to a Model Release form demand within seven (7) days will result in the automatic removal of the associated photograph.</p>\n<p>For your own protection it is highly recommended that you have any model who poses for you sign a release form giving you the explicit permission to publish, share, distribute, and otherwise display the associated images.\nIt is highly recommended that you provide this form immediately after submitting your photograph, especially if your subject is depicted nude.\nDetails of this process may be found in the official DeviantArt FAQ.</p>\nUnderage models\n<p>We <strong>cannot</strong> allow any nude works featuring individuals under the age of 18, nor may the works depict these individuals in a 'sexually driven' manner such as posing in lingerie or displaying a sexually suggestive or provocative pose.</p>\n<p>This prohibition is for legal reasons.\nthe laws in the United States are the governing laws in regards to all submissions regardless of the deviant's country of origin.\nPhotographs which are suspected of depicting a minor in this manner will be temporarily suspended from public view and proper legal documentation (as outlined above) will be demanded while photographs which clearly depict a minor (including toddlers, preteens, and teenagers) in this manner will be removed without notice.</p>\n<p>Submissions of a non- photographic nature which clearly depict a minor, fictional character or otherwise, either nude or in a sexually driven manner will be removed and deleted without notice as they come to the attention of the staff.</p>\nForum Posting\n<p>In addition to the outlines in the above section entitled <strong>\n<em>Prohibited Commentary</em>\n</strong> and <strong>\n<em>Exploitive Commentary</em>\n</strong> we have a few additional policies regarding comments and posts within the Forum areas of DeviantArt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All threads started within a specific forum and all comments within those threads should be relevant to the forums Title.\nThis means that, for example, all threads within the <strong>Movies</strong> forum must relate to a motion picture and the comments within those threads should also remain on the appropriate topic.</li>\n<li>We encourage interactivity and we allow comments to be either positive or negative in nature providing that they remain constructive and promote a worthwhile dialogue.</li>\n<li>We insist that forum threads adhere to the same standard set forth for deviation, scrapbook, and writing submissions in terms of what is considered acceptable subject matter (i.e.\nno racist threads, no sexual discussions, etc).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important to remember to be as clear in your intent as possible while communicating on the internet.\nText communications do not afford a clear representation of sarcasm.\nPlease use common sense when posting to avoid confusion.\nThreads which are misplaced, which contain inappropriate subject matter (such as sexual discussions), or which contain an undesirable number of insults or other violations of this etiquette policy will be locked and closed to further commentary.</p> Avatars\n<p>This section applies only to avatars which you personally use for your account.\navatars submitted into a DeviantArt Gallery or to your Scrapbook must still conform to all official policies without exception but are not subjected to the restrictions below.</p>\n<p>Avatars used to represent your account on site are granted more leniency than standard site submissions.\nYou may freely use material and resources with only the restrictions outlined as follows;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your avatar should not contain nudity of any sort.\n</li>\n<li>You may not use avatars specifically created by other users without their explicit permission.</li>\n<li>If your avatar contains a portion of a work made by another artist it will be removed by staff at the request of the original artist.</li>\n<li>In all other respects your avatar must conform to the guidelines set above in regards to hate propaganda.</li>\n</ul>\nExploits, Vulnerabilities, and Site Abuse\n<p>The DeviantArt staff will not tolerate attempts to exploit or disrupt the layout, navigability, or general use of the site.\nSuch actions disrupt the ability of the community to access and review artwork and are considered Site Abuse.</p>\n<p>We will issue no warnings for violations of this nature.\nViolators will be banned immediately upon the discovery of the disruption or abuse.</p>\n<p>deviantPOINTS may not be used to circumvent or interfere with the operations of DeviantArt and cannot be used as payment for automated services affecting a member's statistical or performance based metrics on DeviantArt.</p> Groups <p>All of the rules and guidelines of this Etiquette Policy apply to activities within a Group or in the management and administration of a Group.\nAll of the policies with respect to content and commentary apply within Groups and any member or watcher of a Group should feel comfortable reporting any activity to which they object on the basis of this Etiquette Policy or otherwise.\nWe are not responsible for the conduct of Group participants or administrators.\nHowever, the Group applications permit us to take appropriate action should intervention become necessary as a result of a violation of the Terms of Service in general or of any other of our policies.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that Group administrators may determine their own rules and privileges for deviants who participate in the Group and as a general rule we will not become involved in any disputes between Group members, between Group administrators or between one or another Group unless there is a clear violation of our own policies, rules and terms.\nWe suggest you use good judgment and decency in all of your Group interactions as well as exercising the same cautions you would use in any Internet exchanges with individuals who you may not know.\nFurther helpful information about Groups can be found in this FAQ and elsewhere on DeviantArt.</p> Changes in Etiquette Policy\n<p>As new situations come to our attention we may find it necessary to alter or expand upon the policies stated here with little or no notification and any such changes may be enforced in full against previously existing submissions or behavior.</p>\n<p>Alterations of policy may be announced through either the DeviantArt Status Forum or through other Announcements and News Topics.</p>\nAppeals and Inquiries\n<p>Appeals, inquiries, or questions concerning deviation removals, violation notices, account suspensions, or other administrative actions should be addressed to the official DeviantArt Helpdesk where they will be forwarded to the appropriate department for review.</p>\n<p>Please refrain from using the DeviantArt Forums, the DeviantArt Note system or personal email to staff members for these concerns.\nYou are unlikely to receive a proper response and will be redirected to use the official Helpdesk.</p>\n<p>Petitions and other forms of public outcry are discouraged and will have no affect on Managerial Reviews of staff actions and may in fact be detrimental to the case in question.</p>

Submission</b>\n</p>\n<p>Here at DeviantArt we respect the rights of all artists and creative people worldwide and we expect our members to also demonstrate that respect and assist us in creating a beneficial and positive atmosphere for all DeviantArt visitors and members.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is: Just about anything that is on this site, on the web, on TV, on CD's, on DVD's, in books &amp.\nin magazines is probably copyrighted by someone.\n</p>\n<p>Copyright can be a confusing territory for many people.\nIn many cases the natural confusion over the sometimes varied circumstances surrounding copyright will lead people to rely on rumor or myth more often than the actual law which naturally confuses the matter even more.</p>\n<p>In this document we will attempt to eliminate some of the confusion and counter many of the myths surrounding copyright and to present clearly the DeviantArt policies and practices with regard to copyright.\nThe availability of this document should not be construed as rendering legal or other professional advice, and this document is not a substitute for the advice of an attorney.\nIf you require legal advice, you should seek the services of a qualified attorney.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>How do I get Copyright?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Under most national laws and international copyright treaties you receive a copyright automatically in any original work as you make it.\nRegistration may be required to exercise some rights, like commencing a lawsuit.\nCopyright does NOT protect ideas.\nCopyright protects the expression of ideas or the ways in which an idea is materially placed or expressed in the work.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>What is Copyright Infringement?</b>\n</p>\n<p>To simplify this question, copyright infringement occurs when you do certain things with a creative work which someone else produced without first getting the proper permission.</p>\n<p>Some examples of copyright infringement (this is only a partial listing) can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Placing someone else's photograph or creative work online without proper permission.</li>\n<li>Using a creative work commercially without permission.</li>\n<li>Adapting someone else's creative work found in one medium to another medium, such as making a book into a movie or a photograph into a painting.</li>\n<li>Modifying or editing a creative work without proper permission.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>How Can I Avoid Infringing on Someone's Copyright?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The best way to avoid infringing on the rights of another creative person is to use your skill, talent and imagination to create your own completely original work.\nWhen we use the word 'original' we don't mean that you must come up with an idea which hasn't been used before - recall that copyright does not protect ideas.\nWhen used in reference to copyright \"original\" means that you created your work without referencing or deliberately copying anyone else's work during the process.\n</p>\n<p>Ensure that all parts of your work, both visual and audio, are your own original creations.\nIf you have used materials which are owned by other people or companies make certain that you have obtained proper permission or licensing for the use before you place your work online.</p>\n<p>You can also obtain permission to use a copyrighted work by license.\nYou can read more here and here.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>What Sort of Things are Copyrighted?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The easy answer to this question is that just about any creative work that is less than 150 years old you might find should be considered copyrighted by default.\n</p>\n<p>A work is not required to have a copyright statement printed on it or near it in order to be considered copyrighted so do not assume that the work is unprotected simply because you cannot see a notice written anywhere.</p>\n<p>Also do not confuse the fact that a work is publicly available with the idea that it is in the public domain or free for use.\nBeing easy to find on the internet does not affect a work's copyrighted status.</p>\n<p>There are many exceptions to the 150 year guideline, but you are best advised to obtain legal advice from an expert if you intend to rely on the possibility that a modern work is not copyrighted.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>Some Cautions</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In most cases it does not matter how much of the material you have used, whether it's a single frame, a few moments of audio, a short clip of video or any other sampling it's still considered to be protected by copyright and you still require the owner's permission for use.</li>\n<li>It doesn't matter how you obtained the material, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission.</li>\n<li>It doesn't matter whether or not you've credited the proper owner, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission.</li>\n<li>It doesn't matter if you are not selling it or making a profit, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission.</li>\n<li>It doesn't matter if you can find other people using things without permission, it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission.</li>\n<li>It doesn't matter if you've edited it a little bit or made a few alterations, if it's recognizable it's still considered copyrighted and you still need permission.</li>\n<li>Read licenses carefully to understand the type of permission they provide.\nFor example, there are many versions of the Creative Commons - each giving different permissions.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>What Happens When You Submit Infringing Works to DeviantArt?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Any copyright owner following the procedures in this Copyright Policy can require DeviantArt to remove his or her copyrighted content in use by a member of DeviantArt.\nWhen through the proper notice we become aware that a submission to DeviantArt infringes upon the copyrights of another artist, creative person or company, we will immediately delete it.\nThis is a legal requirement which we fulfill immediately.\nyou will not receive an advanced warning and you will not be given an opportunity to 'fix it'.\n</p>\n<p>If you believe that a submission on DeviantArt infringes on your copyright you may either report the submission using our internal reporting system or send us a copyright notice via mail or email.\nA member of staff will review your notice and act accordingly.</p>\n<p>If you believe that one of your submissions was removed in error you may contact our helpdesk or otherwise file a counter notice.</p>\n<p>If you are found to repeatedly post infringing content, your account will be suspended and serious offenders will have their account banned and deactivated.\nWe consider three strikes as an indication of being a repeat infringer subject to ban.\nIf you are found deliberately misrepresenting the copyrighted work of another as your own your account will be immediately banned and deactivated.</p>The copyright owner may also decide to sue you directly if you infringe his or her copyright in posting content to DeviantArt.<p>\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>What about \"Fair Use\"</b>\n</p>\n<p>\"Fair Use\" is the notion that some public and private uses of copyrighted works should not require the permission of a copyright owner.\nThese circumstances are very limited, complex to analyze under the law and require the help of expert advice from a lawyer.\nWe recommend you talk to your own lawyer if you want to know more about fair use as it applies to the work you are doing.\nIf it turns out that it isn't fair use, you may be liable for very serious money damages.</p>\n<p>To learn more about fair use you can go here, here, here, and here.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>If you take my work down am I protected from a lawsuit?</b>\n</p>\n<p>No.\nEven if DeviantArt takes an infringing work down, you may still be responsible for very significant damages if the copyright owner decides to sue you.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>Notification of Copyright Infringement</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Instructions for Copyright Owners</b>\n</p>\n<p>This section contains the formal requirements of the Copyright Act with respect to the rights of copyright owners whose content appears on DeviantArt without authorization and instruction to copyright owners.\n</p>\n<p>To file a copyright infringement notification with DeviantArt (also commonly known as a \"DMCA takedown notice\"), the copyright owner or an authorized agent acting on his or her behalf will need to send a written communication that includes substantially the following:</p>\n<p> 1.\nA physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>\n<p> 2.\nIdentification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</p>\n<p> 3.\nIdentification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.\nIn this regard please provide URLs when you identify the location of the material.\n</p>\n<p> 4.\nInformation reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.</p>\n<p> 5.\nA statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</p>\n<p> 6.\nA statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>To file a DMCA takedown notice, you may use our form here.\nThis form requires a DeviantArt account, which is available at no charge by signing up.\nOtherwise you may use the following method: </p>\n<p>Written notice should be sent by mail or by PDF attached to an email

collect and how we use the information we collect?\n<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide, operate and improve our Sites and Services, to administer your use of the Site or

a connected PayPal, Google or Facebook account), credit card information (if you use certain of our features and services), other information as reasonably necessary to provide you with our Services, correspondences (including those made through or uploaded to our Services), and any other personal information provided to us by visitors and/or Users through their access to and/or use of the Site or

data protection laws, we will disclose PII when required by law or under the good-faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to conform to applicable law, comply with subpoenas, court orders or legal process served on DeviantArt, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, and to protect the property or interests of DeviantArt, its agents and employees, personal safety, or the public.\nUnder these circumstances, DeviantArt may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of the disclosure, and DeviantArt

physical, electronic and procedural measures.\nAmong other things, we offer HTTPS secure access to most areas on our Services.\nthe transmission of sensitive payment information (such as a credit card number) through our designated purchase forms is protected by an industry standard SSL/TLS encrypted connection.\nand we regularly maintain a PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards) certification.\nWe also regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and regularly seek new ways and Third Party Services for further enhancing the security of our Services and protection of our Visitors' and Users' privacy.</p>\n<p>However \u00e2\u20ac\u201c regardless of the measures and efforts taken by us, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of your PII, or any other content you upload, publish or otherwise share with us or anyone else.\nWe therefore encourage you to set strong passwords for your User Account, and avoid providing us or anyone with any sensitive information which you believe its disclosure could cause you substantial or irreparable harm.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, because certain areas on our Services are less secure than others, and since e-mail and instant messaging are not recognized as secure forms of communications, we request and encourage you not to share any PII on any of these areas or via any of these methods.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions regarding the security of our Services, you are more than welcome to contact us at security-report@deviantart.com.</p>\nInternational Transfers\n<p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.\nIf you're located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.\nYour use of our Services and submission of any PII represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>\nChildren's Information\n<p>We do not intend that children under 13 years old will use our Services.\nWe do not solicit or knowingly collect information from children under 13 years old, nor will we accept registration from them.\nChildren between the ages of 13-16 require parental or guardian consent prior to accessing or using the Sites.\nIf you are a parent or guardian of a child between the ages of 13-16, and you provide your consent to your child's registration with any of the sites, you agree that you have read and fully understood this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service, in respect of their use and access to the Sites and the Services.</p>\nUpdates\n<p>Any information that we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information is collected by us.\nHowever, we may update this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law from time to time as our Services change and expand, and to reflect changes to our information collection, usage and storage practices.\nIf we update this Privacy Policy, we will notify you about significant changes by sending a notice to the email address specified in your Account, with the use of an internal message directed to your Account or by posting a notice of such changes on the Sites.\nWe encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise provided, the updated Privacy Policy will take effect on the date it is posted.\nOnce such changes become effective, your continued use of the Site and/or Services will signify that you have read the new Privacy Policy and your acknowledgment of the new Privacy Policy.\nIf you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, or any revised Privacy Policy, you should stop using the Sites and/or Services.</p>\nScope\n<p>The DeviantArt Sites contain links to other websites and/or services.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of any companies or individuals that DeviantArt does not control, or any websites and/or services that you link to from the DeviantArt Sites.\nDeviantArt is not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those companies, individuals, websites and/or services and any information that you provide on or to third-party companies, individuals, websites or services are subject to those parties' privacy policies.\nWe are accountable for PII that we receive under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party as described in the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIn particular, we remain responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage to process the PII on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>\n<p>You should use caution and review the privacy policies of any websites that you visit from ours to learn more about their information practices before providing your PII.</p>\nQuestions\n<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our policies or wish
