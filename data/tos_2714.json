\u2013 You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you, as well as the categories of sources from which such information is collected, the purpose for collecting such information, the categories of third parties with whom we share such information, and information about our sale or disclosure for business

in certain circumstances on your behalf.\nSuch authorized agent must be registered with the California Secretary of State.\nWe will endeavor to respond to all such requests within forty-five (45) days, although there may be a brief delay in processing a request while we verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party.\nIf we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\n</p> OTHER CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS <p>Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request, once a year, a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of Personal Information during the preceding year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes, and the categories of Personal Information the company shares.\nAlternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as VICE does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing Personal Information with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice.\nAs stated below in this Privacy Policy, VICE provides you choice prior to sharing your Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\nIf you do not opt in or if you choose to opt out at the time VICE offers that choice, VICE does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>In addition, please note that we may, on occasion, share a portion of our postal mailing list with other reputable organizations not owned or affiliated with VICE who want to market products or services to you.\nIf you do not want your name and address shared with other organizations or you no longer wish to receive Store catalogs, please contact Store customer service at vicemerch@thevandalcollective.com.\nWe will not sell, lease, or transfer this mailing list to any third parties except for this reason.</p> CONTACT INFORMATION <p>If you are a California resident and you have questions about our privacy practices

address:</p>\n<p>49 S.\n2nd St.\n<br> Brooklyn, NY 11249 <br> Attention: Legal Department</p>\n<p>You must put the statement \"Your California Privacy Rights\" in the subject field of your e-mail or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address.\nYou must include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code.\nWe are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information to allow us to respond to you.\n</p> THE INFORMATION THE SITE COLLECTS INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US <p>The Sites may ask you to provide personally identifiable information, which is information that could be used to identify you as a specific individual, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, credit or debit card numbers expiration date and security code (\"Personal Information\") and other information about you, such as demographic information (your gender, ZIP code, age or similar information) or certain information about your preferences and interests.\nThe Sites may collect Personal Information and other information about you at various places and forms on the Sites, including registration forms, when you submit a question to us, when you apply for a job, or when you otherwise communicate or interact with us.\nIf we combine demographic or similar information with the Personal Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.\nPersonal Information may be used by merch.vice.com (the \u201cStore\u201d) when you place an order or save information to the Store, in order to process and fulfill your order.\nWe do not share credit card information with third parties except for the purpose of processing payment for products you\u2019ve ordered and as required by law.</p>\n<p>The Store is operated by Vandal Collective.\nCertain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies with respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.\nFor these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which they may handle your Personal Information.</p>\n<p>Please note that information submitted to the Sites via a \"Contact Us\" or other similar function may not receive a response.\nWe will not use the information provided via these functions to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless we disclose otherwise at the time you submit your request.\nThe Sites are general audience web sites and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13).\nWe will delete any Personal Information collected that we later determine to be from an individual younger than the age of thirteen (13).\nIf a parent, guardian or anyone else becomes aware of Personal Information that has been collected from the use of the Store or Sites by an individual under the age of 13, please contact Store customer service immediately at vicemerch@thevandalcollective.com.\n<br>\n<br> Your Personal Information submitted via the Store may be updated and/or deleted by sending an e-mail to Store customer service at vicemerch@thevandalcollective.com.\n</p> INFORMATION YOU CHOOSE TO PUBLICLY DISPLAY THROUGH THE SITES, AND POSTING CONTENT TO THIRD PARTY SITES <p>You may be able to submit comments, ideas, reviews, suggestions and other content (\" User Content\") to the Sites and to post your User Content publicly on message boards, chat rooms, and other public areas (collectively, \"Community Forums\").</p>\n<p>\n<i> Note that anything you post to a Community Forum is public</i>.\nInformation you choose to post or make available in the Community Forums may be viewed, collected and used by others.\nIf you choose to voluntarily disclose User Content, the protections of this Privacy Policy will not cover your disclosure of that information or content.\nThink carefully before you post and use caution before disclosing any Personal Information.</p>\n<p>VICE may publish User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or later developed).\nSubject to applicable law, we may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information with your User Content, and VICE may use the content, or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities.\nFor full terms and conditions regarding User Content you submit, please review our Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>Also, if you choose to \"like\" content on one of the Sites, to tweet from the Sites or to otherwise post information from or via the Sites to a third party web site, feature or application, that information may be public and the third party may have access to information about you and your use of our Sites.</p> INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE ABOUT A THIRD PARTY <p>If you send someone else a communication from the Sites, such as sending a video to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person.</p> INFORMATION WE COLLECT AUTOMATICALLY AS YOU ACCESS AND USE THE SITES <p>We, as well as any third-party advertisers, service providers and content providers, may use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively collect certain Site usage information whenever you visit or interact with us or our content found elsewhere on the internet (\" Usage Information\").\nUsage Information may include browser type, operating system, all of the areas within our Sites that you visit, including content that you browse, and the time of day, among other information.\nWe may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the Sites and our services.\nIn addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (\"Device Identifier\") for the particular device you use to access the Sites.\nA Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access the Sites and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier.\nSome mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access our Sites.\nUsage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.</p>\n<p>The methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:</p>\n<i>COOKIES</i>\n<p>A cookie is a data file placed on a device when it is used to visit one of our Sites or otherwise access our online content.\nCookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.</p>\n<p>A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device.\nFlash cookies may be used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences.\nFor more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en....\nIf you choose to disable cookies or to adjust your Flash privacy settings on your device, some features of the Sites may not function properly.</p>\n<i>WEB BEACONS</i>\n<p>Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as \"1x1 GIFs\" or \"clear GIFs\") may be included in the Sites' web pages and e-mail messages.\nWeb beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.\nWeb beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails sent were actually opened or to count how many forwarded links were actually viewed.</p>\n<i>EMBEDDED SCRIPTS</i>\n<p>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on.\nThe code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>\n<p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies on the Sites that collect information for security and fraud detection purposes.</p>\n<i>APP TECHNOLOGIES</i>\n<p>App technologies are technologies included in our apps that are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings.\nFor example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server.\nThese SDKs allow us track our conversions, bring you advertising both on and off the service, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our service with your social media account.</p>\n<b>\n<i>LOCATION-IDENTIFYING TECHNOLOGIES</i>\n</b>\n<p>Location-Identifying Technologies are technologies used to collect your location.\nFor example, GPS, WiFi, and Bluetooth may be used to collect precise location data when you consent to precise location tracking through our apps.\nLocation data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device\u2019s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.</p> HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS <p>Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a \"Do Not Track\" signal to websites and online services that you visit.\nThere is no consensus among industry participants as to what \"Do Not Track\" means in this context.\nLike many websites and online services, VICE does not alter its practices when it receives a \"Do Not Track\" signal from a visitor's browser.\nTo find out more about \"Do Not Track,\" please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p> INFORMATION THIRD PARTIES PROVIDE ABOUT YOU AND SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS <p>We may receive information about you from third parties.\nFor example, if you are on another web site and you agree to receive information from a Site or VICE, that web site will forward your contact and other information to us so that we may contact you as requested.\nYou may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature on our Sites (such as posting to your page on a third party service or otherwise linking the Sites with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you post content or allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Personal Information.\nThe information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy.\nThe information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site and service.\nThe third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.\nIn addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their \"connections\" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your \"connections\" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site, application or interactive service.</p>\n<p>We also may verify or supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you.\nWe may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Sites.\nIn those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.</p> HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT <p>VICE may use your information, including your Personal Information: (1) to allow you to participate in features we offer.\n(2) to provide related customer service, including, without limitation, to respond to your questions, complaints or comments.\n(3) to provide you with information or services that you have requested or agreed to receive (either by opting in or choosing not to opt out).\n(4) to process your registration with the Sites, including verifying that your e-mail address is active and valid.\n(5) to improve the Sites or our services.\n(6) to tailor content we display to you and offers we may present to you, both on the Sites and elsewhere online.\n(7) to contact you with regard to your use of the Sites and, in our discretion, changes to the Sites' policies.\n(8) to facilitate your purchase of VICE merchandise.\n(9) for internal business purposes.\nand (10) for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your Personal Information or otherwise with your consent.</p> HOW AND WHEN WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES <p>VICE may share non-personally identifiable information, such as aggregated user statistics and Usage Information, with third parties and some third parties, including third party advertisers, content providers and analytics providers, may themselves collect such information when you visit the Sites.\nWe do not share your Personal Information with third parties for those third parties' marketing purposes unless you first agree to such sharing (either by opting in or choosing not to opt out at the time we provide the choice).\nWe may share the information we have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information or otherwise with your consent, and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i> When You Agree To Receive Information From Third Parties Or Otherwise Request That We Share Your Information</i>\n</b>\n<b> .\n</b>You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties.\nIf you agree at that time to have your Personal Information shared, your Personal Information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties, and, if you later decide that you no longer want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.</p>\n<p>You also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature or third party application, that we share information about you with a third party and we will typically do so under those circumstances.\nFor example, if you \"like\" content on our Sites, information about you may transfer to the third party offering that application on our Sites and to the third party web site to which you are posting.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i> Third Parties Providing Services on our Behalf</i>\n</b>\n<b> .\n</b>We may use third party service providers to perform certain services on behalf of the Sites, such as hosting the Sites, designing and/or operating the Sites' features, analyzing users' interactions with the Sites, sending communications, safeguarding against fraud, or performing other administrative services.\nWe may provide these companies with access to user information, including Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for the Sites.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i> Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions</i>\n</b>\n<b> .\n</b>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a \"Promotion\") that may require registration.\nBy participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to the terms, conditions or official rules that govern that Promotion, which may contain specific requirements of you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing associated with the Promotion.\nIf you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize fulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i> Administrative and Legal Reasons</i>\n</b>\n<b> .\n</b>We may also transfer and disclose user information, including Personal Information, to third parties: (i) in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if in our opinion such disclosure is required by law.\n(ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation.\nor (iii) to protect and/or defend the Sites' Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Sites or to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any individual.\nTo that extent, we may disclose certain Personal Information to an outside company which has been contracted to protect against fraud and the unauthorized use of credit and gift cards.\nWe may also use Device Identifiers (e.g., IP addresses) to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies, in our discretion.\nThese disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i> Business Transfers</i>\n</b>\n<b> .\n</b>VICE may share Personal Information with its subsidiaries and affiliates for internal business reasons.\nVICE also reserves the right to disclose and transfer all information related to the Sites, including Personal Information: (i) to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator of the Sites or component of the Sites, such as
