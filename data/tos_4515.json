following the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation.\nThis updated Privacy policy details how Sublime collects, processes, protects your personal data and responds to your data rights.\nAll data is collected, processed and protected according to existing data protection laws, including the GDPR.\nWe may change this privacy policy from time to time, in order to conform with new laws and regulations, or evolving interpretations.\nWe recommend that you consult this page on a regular basis in order to be aware of any updates we might conduct.</p> 2.\nWho are we?\n<p>We are Sublime Skinz.\nOur registered office address is 21, rue Pierre Picard, 75018 Paris, France.\nOur company number is SIRET : 803 054 048 00035 and our VAT number is FR25803054048.</p>\n<p>Sublime is a leading ad tech company specializing in high impact digital advertising.\nWe are the first platform of our kind to provide wallpaper-based advertising (called skins), working with advertisers, publishers, media agencies, trading desks and ad networks to drive efficient campaigns at scale.\nSublime also provides actionable statistics and transparent insights in real time, allowing brands to capitalise on the most impactful formats.</p>\n<p>We can be contacted at privacy@sublimeskinz.com.\n</p> 3.\nData collection\n<p>Sublime is a global High Impact advertising marketplace that creates and delivers brand multi devices ad experiences that captivate, inspire and activate audiences at scale.\nWe collect some data about you in order to build custom segments against which we will be able to serve high impact campaigns.\nBy collecting those data, we make advertising more relevant, therefore more efficient for our clients and more interesting for Internet users such as yourself.</p> 3.1 End-user data\n<p>When we process your data, you will have consented to data collection and processing from one or several publishers whose sites you have visited.\nWithout that consent, we would not collect or process your data.\nThe data we would collect about you would primarily be user IDs, IP addresses, device IDs, time and day the ad is served, publisher site the ad has been served to, country, the browser you have been using, URL referrers which allow to identify the precise page the user was on...</p>\n<p>Thanks to that information, we will enhance the targeting in response to the engagement we see with those ads.\nWe will also prioritise users who seem to engage better with them.\nThis is both in the interest of our clients and of the users we serve ads to: the more relevant the ads, the more users will feel it is talking to them, the more it will lead to engagement with the products and services of our clients, and then more they will run successful campaigns.\n</p>\n<p>You can change preferences at any time and you can also exercise your rights by writing to privacy@sublimeskinz.com.\n</p>\n<p>Sublime relies upon consent as a legal base.</p>\n<p>Still, we believe we have a legitimate interest to collect and process personal data for the following objectives and purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frequency measurement (counting the number of times ads have been seen): this is necessary if we want to make sure ads are not shown too often to the same user.\nthis is one of the ways we make ads more relevant</li>\n<li>Frequency capping.\nthis is how we will ensure ads are shown a maximum number of times to the same user</li>\n<li>Viewability measurement (understanding if ads are seen by users, often related to their placement on a publisher page).\nthis allows us to guarantee to our clients that the high impact formats they run are properly seen by users we have chosen to serve those ads to</li>\n<li>Click count (counting the number of times ads seen have been clicked on).\nhigh impact formats such as skins are at the same time not intrusive and prone to engagement.\ncounting clicks is a fundamental metric to ensure the campaign is well run</li>\n<li>Understanding browsing behaviours of aggregated users</li>\n<li>Testing ads</li>\n<li>Conversion tracking (counting the number of times users who have seen ads have proceeded to buy a product or service).\nthis is necessary to understand the overall return on investment of that ad</li>\n<li>View-through measurement.\nunderstanding whether users who have seen those ads have ended up buying the products or using the services promoted by those ads</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer.\nCookies contain information that is transferred to your computer\u2019s hard drive.\nThey help us improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service.\nSome of the cookies we use are essential for the site to operate.</p>\n<p>The data points received by our platform Ayads are similar end user data:</p> 3.2 End user data through proprietary platform Ayads\n<p>Ayads.co is Sublime\u2019s advertising platform for activity monitoring and configurations.\nThis is user both by our publishers and employees.\nIt is the platform which allows Sublime to monetise publishers\u2019 inventory.\nAyads.co plays the role of a meta-SSP and is interconnected with a direct ad server, ie Smart adserver.\nWhen the ad is called, that it is when a user visits a page of a site on which ads are displayed, publishers call on the Ayads platform.\nIt will then interface with the SSP partners and with our ad server.</p>\n<p>The data we would collect about you through a tag called SJS would be similar: user IDs, IP addresses, device IDs, time and day the ad is served, publisher site the ad has been served to, country, the browser you have been using, URL referrers which allow to identify the precise page the user was on...</p> 3.3.\nBusiness contacts data\n<p>We will hold some personal data if we have been having a business relationship with you.\nYou may be a client, a supplier, a publisher, an agency, a partner, a direct client, and we might have obtained some personal data about you such as business cards, names, email addresses, phone numbers, titles, business addresses etc.\nWe use that personal data in order to communicate and exchange, frequently or not.</p>\n<p>Or you could be a professional or business acquaintance with whom we hope to start a business relationship.\nWe would have obtained that information from exchanging emails or business cards, meeting at industry events or at client meetings etc.\nCurrent law would not require us to obtain new consent in order to hold and continue processing this data.\nStill, you can always exercise your rights and ask for removal or erasure or portability etc.\nof your personal data by writing to us at privacy@sublimeskinz.com\n</p>\n<p>We regularly review our data base of clients and prospects and apply the following retention policy with regards to business contacts, ie we will delete your data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Two years after the last contact</li>\n<li>Four years after the end of the contractual relationship</li>\n</ul> 3.4.\nEmployee data\n<p>If you are an employee at Sublime, we suggest you refer to our HR policy and the clauses regarding data protection on your employment contract.\nIt is available with our HR department.\nWe will only keep employee data which we deem necessary to fulfill certain tasks such as paying salaries, taxes etc.</p> 4.\nTypes of data collected and processed\n<p>Sublime collects three types of data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data collected by Sublime, for Sublime\u2019s purposes, from a publisher page.\nthis is what the industry calls 1st party data</li>\n<li>Client data which is collected by Sublime if a client onboards from their client database (CRM system), this is what the industry calls 2nd party data</li>\n<li>Data supplied by data providers to Sublime, this is what the industry calls 3rd party data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, from each individual publisher, Sublime receives:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User IDs (commonly called cookie data)</li>\n<li>IP Address;</li>\n<li>Time and day ad is served;</li>\n<li>Publisher site;</li>\n<li>Country;</li>\n<li>List of IP addresses from source to destination including the proxy;</li>\n<li>Browser, user agent;</li>\n<li>Device;</li>\n<li>Ad engagement metrics: clicks, impressions, viewability;</li>\n<li>Campaign data;</li>\n<li>Some location data, no more granular than the user's city;</li>\n<li>URL referrer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not collect nor hold any information such as email, address, phone number, credit card information etc, considered high risk data under the GDPR.\nThe cookie data we hold about you is not data which allows us to know who you are.</p>\n<p>We do not process any data which could be used, with help of a third party, to determine the identity of users.\nWe do not know who you are and we do not wish to know.\nWe do not need to know who you are in order to run our business effectively.</p> 5.\nPurposes\n<p>We use the information we collect about web users in order to provide our advertising service, to improve it and for fraud detection.\n</p>\n<p>Below are the specific purposes (or objectives of the processing of your data) for which we use the information we collect about web users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>We use the data for insights and analytics:</strong> for example, we aggregate the number of impressions per country or city, or the number of impressions per type of browser.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We use data to personalize your web experience:</strong> we use IP address to estimate geolocation and propose targeted content.\nFor example, for local stores campaigns, we may have been asked to target people in the same city or region of this store to increase conversion.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We also use data for research and development:</strong> We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated and useful.\nWe use data to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We use the data for safety and security:</strong> we use information about web users to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of Service policies.\nFraudulent activity costs billions of euros to the industry each year.\nit is essential to prevent this.\nit protects publishers and the quality of the content they provide, it protects you from malicious individuals or organisations, it protects advertisers who run campaigns on digital channels.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We also need to protect our business interests and legal rights:</strong> when required by law or when we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about web users in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sublime believes consent should be the main legal base for collecting and processing your data.\nThis means the personal data Sublime collects and processes should only be data that you are happy to share with Sublime.</p> 6.\nCookies\n6.1.\nFirst and third party cookies\n<p>A cookie is a small text file composed of alpha-numeric characters which is created on a computer when a browser accesses a web

privacy@sublimeskinz.com\n</p>\n<p>On the right to erasure: as we do not know your name, email address, address, postcode, we don\u2019t know who you are, where you live, what you do, it might be hard to identify your personal data, or we might not be in a position where we can technically locate it.\nAs we apply techniques such as data minimisation (not processing more data than what is needed), we consider it would be against the spirit of the law to hold data allowing us to identify you in case you want to exercise your right to erasure.\nWhere we do not have the ability to identify individuals, we will be unable to address individual requests for erasure.\nUnder GDPR we would not be obligated to collect more data about the data subject for the sole purpose of responding to a
