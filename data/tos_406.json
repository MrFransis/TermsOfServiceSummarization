our servers, we make sure they are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) and other algorithms.\nAll your personal information is stored on secure servers, and protected in controlled facilities.\nWe classify your information based on importance and sensitivity, and ensure that your personal information has the required level of security.\nWe have special access controls for cloud-based data storage, and we regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against any unauthorized access and use.\nWe conduct due diligence on business partners and third party service providers to make sure that they are able to protect your personal information.\nWe also check that appropriate security
