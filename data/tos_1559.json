Data may be processed for other purposes you have consented to, or in cases where another legal basis applies or where we are legally allowed to do so.\nWhenever necessary and subject to statutory record-keeping requirements, HERE will delete and/or anonymize Personal Data that are no longer needed.\nIf there has not been any recent activity on your profile, we may delete your profile after a

obtaining and releasing Personal Data as required by law, judicial organizations or practice in order to comply with legal obligations imposed on us.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HERE processes your Personal Data pursuant to several legal bases, depending on the type of data and purpose of the processing.\nUnder most circumstances, HERE\u2019s processing of your Personal Data in the recruitment context is based on your request in the anticipation of entering into an employment agreement with HERE.\nHERE will also process this information where required to comply with legal obligations to which it is subject, such as governmental reporting obligations.\nIn some circumstances, HERE will process your Personal Data pursuant to its own legitimate interests in operating its business, including conducting the above described activities for internal administrative purposes and ensuring network and information security.\nA different legal basis may be provided at the point where Personal Data is collected.</p>\n<p>4.\nHow is Sensitive Information treated?</p>\n<p>HERE aims to limit the collection of Sensitive Information<sup>\n<sup>[1]</sup>\n</sup> and shall only collect Sensitive Information if there is a legal justification for processing it, or if it is collected and processed with your express consent.</p>\n<p>HERE recognizes the additional need to protect Sensitive Information.\nAll Sensitive Information is processed in strict compliance with applicable local law and only by a restricted number of individuals who have a clear and justified need to know such information.</p>\n<p>Sensitive Information may be processed where necessary to enable HERE to exercise its legal rights or perform its legal obligations in the field of employment law or related fields of law.\nExamples of such obligations include ensuring the health and safety of HERE\u2019s employees through the provision of a safe working environment or where the processing is carried out by a doctor or similar health professional bound by a duty of confidentiality to you and is necessary for medical purposes.</p>\n<p>5.\nWho has access to your data?</p>\n<p>It is HERE\u2019s responsibility to implement appropriate access control measures to ensure that your Personal Data is only accessed by persons having a clear need to know such information.</p>\n<p>The extent to which your Personal Data are made accessible will depend upon the nature of the data concerned.\nPrior to hire, your Personal Data is not made widely available.\nSome Personal Data, such as your resume, job history, and other information relevant to assessing your fitness for the position to which you have applied, are made available as needed to the HERE team you are seeking to join, others within HERE with a stake in the applied for role, and appropriate members of the HERE Human Resources Department.\nExcept as needed to assess your qualifications for the role, access to most of your Personal Data is restricted to certain experts (e.g.\nHuman Resources, IT or Legal) to the extent necessary to perform their work tasks.</p>\n<p>6.\nTransfer of your Personal Data</p>\n<p>HERE will not sell, lease, rent or otherwise disclose your Personal Data except as provided in this section:</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nConsent: HERE may share your Personal Data if you have given your consent for HERE to do so.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nHERE companies and authorized third parties: HERE may share your Personal Data with other HERE companies or authorized third parties who process Personal Data for HERE for the purposes described in this Policy or otherwise provide recruitment related services to HERE.\nIn such cases HERE will ensure that there is a genuine need to transfer your Personal Data and that measures are in place to safeguard the processing of your Personal Data through other HERE companies or authorized third parties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Authorized third parties include, for example, recruitment agencies, professional advisors, external legal counsel, consumer credit reporting agencies, recruiting systems providers, providers of assessments and other third party suppliers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Authorized third parties may technically have access to your Personal Data in the course of providing their services but will be contractually restricted (or subject to a professional or statutory duty of confidentiality) from processing your Personal Data for other purposes.\nHERE also requires them to act consistently with this Policy and to use appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nInternational transfers of Personal Data: HERE is a global company that has affiliates, business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross national borders.\nThis means that your Personal Data may be transferred across international borders to countries other than the one where you are applying to as an applicant.\nSuch other countries do not always have equivalent laws providing specific protection for or rights in relation to Personal Data or they have different rules on privacy and data protection.\nHERE takes steps to ensure that there is a legal basis for such a transfer and that adequate protection for your Personal Data is provided as required by applicable law.\nSuch steps include, for example, the use of standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or relevant authorities and the requirement to use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your Personal Data.\nYou may contact the HERE Privacy Office at privacy@HERE.com to obtain additional information about the safeguards taken by HERE in connection with these transfers.\nA copy of the unchangeable Standard Contractual Clauses can be accessed on the webpage of the European Commission.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nMandatory disclosures: HERE may be required by or under mandatory law to disclose your Personal Data to certain authorities or other third parties, for example, to government agencies responsible for the employment activities, statistical information or to the police or other law enforcement agencies, for example in context of conducting a background check.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nMergers and acquisitions: Where HERE takes steps to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its businesses in certain countries, this may involve disclosing Personal Data to prospective or actual purchasers and their advisers.\nIn such circumstances, HERE will take all reasonable steps to ensure that appropriate measures to protect Personal Data are taken by such prospective or actual purchasers and their advisors.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nOther: HERE may disclose your personal data if it is necessary to protect your vital interests.\nHERE may also disclose and otherwise process your Personal Data in accordance with applicable law to defend HERE\u2019s legitimate interests, for example, in legal proceedings.</p>\n<p>7.\nWhat steps are taken to safeguard Personal Data?</p>\n<p>Privacy and security are key considerations for HERE.\nWe have assigned specific responsibilities to address privacy and security related matters.\nWe enforce our internal policies and guidelines through an appropriate selection of activities, including proactive and reactive risk management, security and privacy engineering, training and assessments.\nWe take appropriate steps to address online security, physical security, risk of data loss and other such risks taking into consideration the risk represented by the processing and the nature of the data being protected.\nAlso, we limit access to our data bases containing Personal Data to authorized persons having a justified need to access such information.</p>\n<p>8.\nData quality</p>\n<p>We take reasonable steps to keep the Personal Data we possess accurate and to delete incorrect or unnecessary Personal Data.\nWe encourage you to access your Personal Data through your account from time to time to ensure that it is up to date.\nTo the extent permitted or required by applicable local law or subject to your consent, we may use public sources in order to verify that Personal Data we hold is correct.</p>\n<p>9.\nYour rights</p>\n<p>With respect to the processing of your Personal Data, you will always

safety guidelines, which includes also special information to help parents protect their children when they use internet services.</p> Protect your privacy <p>Consider carefully before publishing any identifiable information about yourself or your family.\nFind out about available filters and adjust your privacy settings so your profile and certain information cannot be seen by outsiders.</p> Beware of information from unproven sources <p>Don\u2019t believe everything you read, just because it is online.\nCarefully assess the validity of the information you view, based on its origin, the reputation of the source, and how it\u2019s reported elsewhere.</p> Remember the internet is a public space <p>Anything you write or share on the internet, on web pages that can be seen by anyone with an online connection, may be considered as public.\nOnce you have posted information, even if you delete it soon afterwards, it may circulate quickly and easily (and potentially for an indefinite time).\nBe aware of these facts before you post or share anything online.</p> Learn what is considered offensive or prohibited conduct <p>Ensure that you behave appropriately, and learn how to report any inappropriate behaviour.</p> Copy and share with care <p>Copying content directly from a website and submitting it as your own work may be illegal.\nCopying and distributing music or media may also be illegal.\nMake sure you are aware of any copyright restrictions on anything that you copy and use elsewhere.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p> Be careful meeting online contacts in the real world <p>If you plan to meet someone you\u2019ve been in contact with online, make sure you tell close friends or family about who you\u2019re meeting and where, and make sure that your meeting place is in a safe, relatively busy public place.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p> Stop and think before uploading images from your mobile device <p>This is a quick and easy way to share photos, but you need to be sure that the photos are appropriate to post online.</p> Mobile devices might contain as much sensitive information as a computer <p>Emails, contacts and even passwords pre-entered into websites on your mobile device may still be held on your handset \u2013 so take steps to protect and secure your mobile phone.</p> Be cautious about sharing your location <p>Some services allow you to share your location with friends and other contacts, but only share this information with people you trust.\nThink: do you want anybody and everybody to know exactly where you are (and therefore where you are not) at any given time?</p> Always remember that data charges may apply <p>When you use mobile internet services it may involve transmission of large amounts of data through your service provider\u2019s network.\nContact your network service provider for information about data transmission charges.</p> Are you a parent? Is your child online, or using mobile internet services? <p>If you\u2019re a parent, we\u2019ve collected some advice and guidelines to help your children stay safe when they go online.</p> Take a close look at the internet services your children use <p>Consider setting up your own account to see what the service is all about.\nMake sure that your children are old enough to use the service.\nTalk to your child about any concerns you may have.</p> Teach children that certain information is personal <p>Help your children to carefully consider whether they should publicly disclose information like their full name, street address and phone number.\nMake sure they know that family financial information is personal and should stay that way.\nTell children not to choose a user name, identity and/or profile that gives away too much personal information.</p> Explain to your children to only post things they are comfortable with others seeing <p>Encourage your child to think about every comment, picture and video they post online.\nEmployers, school admissions officers, coaches, and teachers may see your child\u2019s postings.</p> Teach your children that when they post anything online, it remains there for a long time <p>Even if your child deletes information from a website, copies or older versions may exist on other people\u2019s computers and be recirculated online \u2013 for an indefinite period.</p> Teach your children about the dangers of online bullying <p>Online bullying takes many forms, from spreading rumours online and posting private messages without the sender\u2019s approval, to sending threatening messages.\nEncourage children to talk to you if they feel targeted by a bully.</p> Teach your children about not discussing sex online <p>Make sure your children know never to talk about sex with strangers online or send sexually revealing pictures of themselves or anyone else.</p> Tell your children not to lie about their age <p>Teach your children that if they say they\u2019re 18 or over when they\u2019re not (for instance), this is a dishonest statement that can get them into trouble.</p> Teach your children to be aware of sites they use <p>Encourage your children to be aware of a site\u2019s safety notifications and privacy standards before they save any personal information or make a post.\nMake sure your children

a map, interact with them and access relevant content, as well as synchronize information related to your drives to access from other screens and devices.\nYou can share places, routes and arrival times with your friends.\nThe Service also helps you to optimize your daily commute by learning your habits.</p>\n<p>Your agreement with these terms implies your responsibility for ensuring that this information is passed on to other users of the vehicle, such as co-drivers or passengers, and ensure that these users also accept these terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What information do we collect?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Registration and contact details</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some features may require the use of an InControl Navigation Account, for example when you want to share your location with other users or sync your favourites.\nYou may continue to use other available features of the Service without signing in.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Location data and place information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our Service makes use of information about your actual location (\u201cLocation Data\u201d) and expressed interests in points of interest (\u201cPlaces Data\u201d).\nLocation Data reveals where you currently are or where you have been.\nLocation Data is based on available positioning methods, such as GPS.\nPlaces Data is general information pertaining to particular geographical locations (e.g.\na city or a location of a restaurant) that you may have provided to us, for example your favourite places.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise stated, we use random identifiers in connection with your Location Data that do not identify you personally.</p>\n<p>When you start to use the Service, the application acquires your current location using underlying positioning technologies in the vehicle.</p>\n<p>The Service may send your Location Data to HERE when you use location enabled features of the Service online, such as ask information about nearby content, services or offerings or share your location.\nAs further defined below, Location Data may be collected when you use the navigation feature for service improvement purposes without identifying you personally.\nPlaces Data may be sent to HERE for example when you synchronise your favourites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Traffic improvement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Whenever you use the Service while having traffic features enabled, the Service sends, on regular intervals, your current location, speed, direction and timestamp to us to provide you and other users of the Service with better traffic service such as detect traffic jams, traffic patterns, changed road conditions and other such conditions as well as to identify new routes on the map.\nThis information is analysed to distinguish independent routes and traffic patterns and contains a changing identifier, which is persistent only for the duration of the route.\nThis information is sent to us when you use the Service online.\nIn case you are using the Service offline, we may collect this information locally and it may be sent to us on your next connection.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>My Commute</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may activate My Commute feature in the Service to let the Service learn your daily commutes and help you optimize your travel.\nWhile learning your daily commutes, the Service can start recommending optimal times for travel based on foreseen traffic situation.\nAll the information collected by the My Commute feature, which includes information about the routes you\u2019ve driven and places related to your commute remains only in the vehicle and is never sent outside the vehicle.\nInformation is stored protected against unauthorized use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may manage your learned routes and preferences and you may turn the My Commute feature on and off via settings of the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical information and your transactions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you use the Service online, certain technical information such as the details of the application version, service permissions, vehicle identification number, internet protocol address, time zone, technical details of your connection as well as your transactions with HERE may be automatically collected by HERE.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How do we use that information?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Non-personal use of Location Data and Places Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not associate your Location Data or Places Data with your other personally identifiable information, such as an InControl Navigation Account, unless you have asked us to do so.\nFor example, if you point to a position in a map to favourite it we do not combine this information with your Location Data unless you have asked us to do so.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to prevent associating your Location Data with other personally identifiable information without your permission.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Provision of the Services</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As explained in more detail in the privacy policy, the information collected by the Service is utilised to provide you with the Service, to develop our products and services as well as to communicate with you.</p>\n<p>We may also use the information to provide you with more improved search and recommendations to better assist you to find a place you may like.</p>\n<p>As explained above, the traffic information collected from your drives is used in an anonymous manner to provide you and other users of the Service with better service and to detect new routes on the map.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What is our legal basis for processing your Personal

not impact the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before it was withdrawn.\nSome of the features in the Service might be only available based on consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How long do we retain Personal Data?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We endeavor to only collect personal data that are necessary for the purposes for which they are collected, and to retain such data for no longer than is necessary for such purposes.\nThe length of time personal data is retained, and criteria for determining that time, are dependent on the nature of the personal data and the purpose for which it was provided.\nFor example, for your personal data related to managing your account (such as name, email address, and account content and preferences) are maintained for as long as they are retained by you within your account.\nOther data, such as records of your activity within the application, are typically maintained only for a short period before being anonymized.\nYou may contact the HERE Privacy Office at privacy@HERE.com to obtain additional information about retention of your personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your choices</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Service offers a variety of choices to

the collection of Location Data for traffic improvement purposes by turning off the traffic service.\nNote that then you\u2019re also not able to benefit from the traffic service.</p>\n<p>You may choose to create a profile either locally in the vehicle or an InControl Navigation Account with features which help you store and synchronize your information outside the vehicle context, such as with your mobile and other devices.\nYou may choose to enable and disable the synchronization or your favourites as well as your most recent location of your car.</p>\n<p>If you have enabled the synchronization of the location of your parked car, the Service will automatically, or upon request, send the parked car location in association with each and every active InControl Navigation Account on the vehicle.\nThis allows you to easily share the location of your car for example with other family members.\nIf you don\u2019t want to share the location of your car with other account holders, please make sure the other users are in a logged out state while you drive.</p>\n<p>You may delete a local profile, which will delete all locally stored information associated to your profile, such as recent destinations and recent searches.\nDeleting a local profile from the vehicle will not delete any InControl Navigation Account you may have created.</p>\n<p>You may also remove or terminate your InControl Navigation Account.\nIf you remove your InControl Navigation Account from the vehicle, it remains active for your future use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do we share your information?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your Location Data will not be shared with other service providers or advertisers without your permission.</p>\n<p>In case you have an InControl Navigation Account, the Service may allow you to share your Location Data or Places Data.\nFor example, if you choose to share your estimated time of arrival with selected individuals, you can do so either via SMS or email.\nWe will facilitate the sharing interaction by collecting the list of recipients you have specified and by sending notification messages to the recipients of your choice.</p>\n<p>The Service
