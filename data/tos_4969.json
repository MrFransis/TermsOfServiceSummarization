Services, including all information, data, logos, marks, designs, graphics, pictures, sound files, other files, and their selection and arrangement, is called \u201cContent\u201d.\nContent provided by Users, whether they are Subscribers, Customers or other Users, is called \u201cUser Content\u201d.\nFor example, data about its Customers and about its timesheet entries that a Subscriber provides to the Services is User Content of that Subscriber, data about its payments that a Customer provides to the Services is User Content of that Customer, and Content that a User enters into the FreshBooks forum or enters as a comment on the FreshBooks blog is User Content of the User.</p>\n<p>User Content is that User\u2019s property.\nFreshBooks\u2019 only right to that User Content is the limited licenses to it granted in these Terms.\nThose licenses are described in Section 5 and Section 17 of these Terms.</p>\n<p>Other than the User Content, the Services, all Content and all software available on or in respect of the Services or used to create and operate the Services (including, without limitation, the Application and the FreshBooks API) is the property of FreshBooks or its licensors, and is protected by Canadian and international copyright laws, and all rights to the Services, such Content and such software are expressly reserved.\nAll trademarks, registered trademarks, product names and company names or logos mentioned in the Services are the property of their respective owners.\nReference to any products, services, processes or other information, by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, supplier or otherwise does not constitute or imply endorsement, sponsorship or recommendation thereof by FreshBooks.</p>\n<p>Your User Content is your responsibility.\nWe have no responsibility or liability for it, or for any loss or damage your User Content may cause to you or other people.\nAlthough we have no obligation to do so, we have the sole discretion to remove, screen or edit without notice any User Content posted or stored on the Services, and we may do this at any time and for any reason.\nYou are solely responsible for maintaining copies of and replacing any User Content you post or store on the Services.\nIf you authorize third parties to access your User Content through the Services, including through the FreshBooks API, you agree that we are permitted to provide to them the User Content, and also agree that we have no responsibility or liability for their use of such User Content.</p>\n<p>5.\nYour Limited License of Your User Content to FreshBooks</p>\n<p>We do not claim any ownership interest in your User Content, but we do need the right to use your User Content to the extent necessary to operate the Site and provide the Services, now and in the future.\nFor example, if you leave comments on the FreshBooks blog or posts on the FreshBooks forum, we need your license to display that User Content on the Services, and we need the right to sublicense that User Content to our other Users so that they can view that User Content.\nIf you are a Subscriber and enter timesheet data in relation to a Customer and configure your account to display timesheet data to your Customers, we need your license to that User Content to use it in the operation of the Services, and we need the right to sublicense that User Content to your Customers for that purpose.</p>\n<p>Therefore, by posting or distributing User Content to or through the Services, you (a) grant FreshBooks and its affiliates and subsidiaries a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable right to use, display, perform, reproduce, distribute, publish, modify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works from such User Content, in the manner in and for the purposes for which the Services from time to time use such User Content.\n(b) represent and warrant that (i) you own and control all of the rights to the User Content that you post or otherwise distribute, or you otherwise have the lawful right to post and distribute that User Content, to or through the Services.\nand (ii) the use and posting or other transmission of such User Content does not violate these Terms and will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity.</p>\n<p>If your User Content is intended for the use of other Users (for example, if you issue invoices to Customers or authorize third parties to access your User Content through the FreshBooks API), you also grant us and our affiliates and subsidiaries a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable right to sublicense such User Content to such Users for their use in connection with their use of the Services, as described in these Terms.</p>\n<p>These licenses from you are non-exclusive because you have the right to use your User Content elsewhere.\nThey are royalty-free because we are not required to pay you for the use of your User Content on the Services.\nAnd they are transferable because we need the right to transfer these licenses to any successor operator of the Services.\nOur rights to \u201cmodify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works from\u201d are necessary because the normal operation of the Services does this to your User Content when it processes it for use in the Services.</p>\n<p>6.\nOur Limited License of Content to You</p>\n<p>FreshBooks grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to access the Services and to view, copy and print the portions of the Content available to you through the Services.\nSuch license is subject to these Terms, and specifically conditioned upon the following: (i) you may only view, copy and print such portions of the Content for your own use.\n(ii) you may not modify or otherwise make derivative works of the Content, or reproduce, distribute or display the Content (except for page caching) except as expressly permitted in these Terms.\n(iii) you may not remove or modify any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices that have been placed in the Content.\n(iv) you may not use any data mining, robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods.\nand (v) you may not use the Services or the Content other than for their intended purpose.</p>\n<p>Except as expressly permitted above, any use of any portion of the Content without the prior written permission of its owner is strictly prohibited and will terminate the license granted in this Section, this Agreement and your account with us.\nAny such unauthorized use may also violate applicable laws, including without limitation copyright and trademark laws.\nUnless explicitly stated herein, nothing in these Terms may be construed as conferring any license to intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise.\nThe license in this Section is revocable by FreshBooks at any time.</p>\n<p>You represent and warrant that your use of the Services and the Content will be consistent with this license and will not infringe or violate the rights of any other party or breach any contract or legal duty to any other parties, or violate any applicable law in Canada, the United States, and any country in which you are using the Services.\nThese laws include economic sanctions.\n\u201cEconomic sanctions\u201d means United Nations Security Council Resolutions requiring states to restrict or prohibit business activities with certain foreign states, individuals and entities of those states, and non-state actors, and the laws, regulations and policies that restrict or prohibit business activities with certain foreign states, individuals and entities of those states, and non-state actors.</p>\n<p>To request permission for uses of Content not included in this license, you may contact FreshBooks at the address set out at the bottom of these Terms.</p>\n<p>7.\nUsing the FreshBooks API</p>\n<p>This Section contains terms and conditions applicable to your use of the FreshBooks API, whether you are a Subscriber or other User, including a developer or operator of a website or application (such a website or application, a \u201cFreshBooks API Implementation\u201d, and the developer or operator, an \u201cAPI Developer\u201d) who wishes to use the FreshBooks API for the purpose of including Content in your FreshBooks API Implementation.\nIf you are a Subscriber and you procure a third-party to develop a FreshBooks API Implementation for you, this Section applies to your and their use of the FreshBooks API, and you are responsible for their compliance with this Section to the same extent as though you were developing the FreshBooks API Implementation yourself.</p>\n<p>If you are an API Developer and not otherwise a User, your use of the FreshBooks API constitutes your agreement to these Terms.\nWe may change these Terms without notice to you by posting new Terms on the Site.\nIt is your responsibility to review the Site for changes to the Terms.\nIf you use the Services after new Terms are posted, your use of the Services constitutes your agreement to the new Terms.\nIf you do not wish to be bound by the new Terms, cease your use of the Services.</p>\n<p>If you are an API Developer and not otherwise a Subscriber or other User of the Services, the license set forth in this Section applies to your use of the FreshBooks API, and the license set forth in Section 6 does not apply to your use of the FreshBooks API.\nIf you are also a Subscriber or other User, the license set forth in Section 6 applies to your use of Content other than the FreshBooks API, and this Section applies to your use of the FreshBooks API.</p>\n<p>FreshBooks grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license to use the FreshBooks API as provided by FreshBooks, in the manner permitted by the Terms.\nSuch license does not license any other Content to you, including Subscriber Content.\nIf you wish to use your FreshBooks API Implementation to display or deliver any Content provided to us by a Subscriber, you must obtain the prior agreement of that Subscriber to that use, by obtaining a license from the Subscriber, in terms of use governing the use by that Subscriber of your FreshBooks API Implementation, for your use of that Content.\nThis limited license is subject to the usage restrictions set forth in Section 6, and any further restrictions set out in your terms of use and privacy policy agreed to by the Subscriber.\nIf you do not present terms of use and a privacy policy to our Subscribers upon their use of your FreshBooks API Implementation, you may not use the FreshBooks API.</p>\n<p>Your use of the FreshBooks API is also subject to the following restrictions.\nYou may not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>interfere or attempt to interfere in any manner with the proper workings of the FreshBooks API, or create or distribute any FreshBooks API Implementation that adversely affects the functionality or performance of the Services or adversely impacts the behavior of other applications using the FreshBooks API;</li>\n<li>misrepresent your identity or intentions when communicating

inappropriate;</li>\n<li>use the FreshBooks API for any application that constitutes, promotes or is used in connection with spyware, adware, other malicious programs or code;</li>\n<li>use the FreshBooks API in any manner or for any purpose that violates any law or regulation, any right of any person, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or rights of

otherwise negatively represent FreshBooks in your FreshBooks API Implementation;</li>\n<li>use the FreshBooks API for any application that attempts to replace or replicate the essential user

ineffective any IP address-based functionality or restriction imposed by the Services;</li>\n<li>circumvent technological measures to prevent direct database access, nor manufacture tools or products to that effect;</li>\n<li>build conversion functionality that converts Content from the Service to a competing product or service.\nor</li>\n<li>at any time you are operating your FreshBooks API Implementation, solicit, interfere with or endeavor to entice away from us any of our Subscribers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You agree to carefully monitor your use of the FreshBooks API and ensure that it remains within reasonable operational limits for both your own server capacity and for ours.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we may impose or adjust the limit on the number of transactions you may send or receive through the Service.\nsuch fixed upper limits may be set by us at any time, at our discretion.\nIf we impose such limits, we may describe them on our Site.\nFreshBooks may charge additional fees for the excess.\nUnused API calls will not roll over to the next period.</p>\n<p>You will not attempt to exceed or circumvent limitations on access, calls and use of the FreshBooks API, or otherwise use the FreshBooks API in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volume, constitutes excessive or abusive usage, or otherwise fails to comply or is inconsistent with any part of these Terms.\nFreshBooks may monitor your use of the FreshBooks API and, if your application(s) does or will connect the FreshBooks API to five hundred or more systems, FreshBooks reserves the right to limit or suspend access to the FreshBooks API by you or your API client(s) and to contact you to discuss the volume and terms of your API calls.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to rate limit other functionality to prevent abuse, spam, denial-of-service attacks, or other security issues.</p>\n<p>FreshBooks has no responsibility to any person for any use or misuse of any Content obtained through the FreshBooks API.\nIf you are a Subscriber, you should consider carefully whether you wish to give an API Developer access to your Content through the FreshBooks API.\nIf you wish to revoke access to your Content through the FreshBooks API, you should change your FreshBooks access credentials or revoke authorization of the FreshBooks API Implementation to your Content.\nPlease contact us at support@FreshBooks.com if you want assistance doing this.</p>\n<p>FreshBooks may monitor your use of the FreshBooks API for any reason, including but not limited to: quality assurance, the improvement of FreshBooks products and services, and for verification of your compliance with these Terms.\nYou shall not interfere with such monitoring or otherwise obscure from FreshBooks any aspect of your use of the FreshBooks API.\nFreshBooks may use any technical means to overcome such interference.\nFreshBooks may suspend access to the API by you or your API client without notice if FreshBooks reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms.\nYou acknowledge that any use by us of your FreshBooks API Implementation for such purpose will not constitute our agreement to any terms of use you purport to require us to comply with in such use.</p>\n<p>FreshBooks does not warranty anything relating to third party applications which you choose to integrate with your use of the FreshBooks Application and Services.\nFreshBooks does not guarantee that integration between your use of the FreshBooks Application and a third party application will be error free or functionally possible.\nIn some circumstances, we indicate on the Site that a third party application is \u2018FreshBooks Tested\u2019 which means that we have tested the functional integration of the FreshBooks platform with the third party application.\nIn some circumstances, we indicate that a third party application is a \u2018Top Pick\u2019 which may mean that the application is one of the more popular applications with Freshbooks Users.\nYou are responsible for satisfying yourself with the function and security of a third party application you seek to integrate with your use of the FreshBooks Application.\nFurther, you are responsible for making yourself aware of the terms of service and privacy policy of the third parties whose platforms you seek to integrate with your use of the FreshBooks Application and Services.\nYour use of such third party applications shall be exclusively governed by and subject to the terms of service and privacy policy of the applicable third party providers of such applications.</p>\n<p>8.\nUse of Interactive Areas and the Services</p>\n<p>The Services may include discussion forums, bulletin boards, review services or other forums in which you or third parties may post reviews or other content, messages, materials or other items on the Services (\u201cInteractive Areas\u201d).\nIf FreshBooks provides such Interactive Areas, you are solely responsible for your use of such Interactive Areas and use them at your own risk.\nUser Content submitted to any public area of the Services will be considered non-confidential.\nYou agree not to post, upload to, transmit, distribute, store, create or otherwise publish through the Services any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>any message, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, graphics, code or other material that is unlawful, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, indecent, lewd, suggestive, harassing, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent or otherwise objectionable;</li>\n<li>content that would constitute, encourage or provide instructions for a criminal offense, violate the rights of any party, or that would otherwise create liability or violate any local, state, national or international law;</li>\n<li>content that may infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual or proprietary right of any party;</li>\n<li>content that impersonates any person or entity or otherwise misrepresents your affiliation with a person or entity;</li>\n<li>unsolicited promotions, political campaigning, advertising or solicitations;</li>\n<li>private information of any third party, including, without limitation, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and credit card numbers, unless that third party has expressly consented to such use;</li>\n<li>viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files;</li>\n<li>content that is unrelated to the topic of the Interactive Area(s) in which such Content is posted.\nor</li>\n<li>content that, in the sole judgment of FreshBooks, is objectionable or which restricts or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Interactive Areas or the Services, or which may expose FreshBooks or its affiliates or its users to any harm or liability of any type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, FreshBooks has a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy towards SPAM: you may not use the Interactive Areas or the Services generally to send commercial or other messages to any third-party if those messages are not solicited, authorized or welcomed by the third-party, and in your use of the Services you must comply with all applicable laws, including laws that apply in any jurisdiction to SPAM and marketing practices, and with any applicable marketing association guidelines on ethical marketing practices.</p>\n<p>Any use of the Interactive Areas or other portions of the Services in violation of the foregoing violates these Terms and may result in, among other things, termination or suspension of your rights to use the Interactive Areas and/or the Services.</p>\n<p>9.\nProviding a Reliable and Secure Service</p>\n<p>We take reliability and security seriously, and put a great deal of effort into ensuring that our service operates all the time, and that it is a secure environment for your data.\nWe use what we believe to be \u201cbest-of-class\u201d hosting services and security technologies and services that we believe provide you with a secure and safe environment.\nMore information about these services and technologies is available on&nbsp;the Site.</p>\n<p>For example, to safeguard credit card information, FreshBooks handles all cardholder data (credit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, service code) in a secure manner that is consistent with the PCI DSS requirement.\nWe use restrictive firewalls to protect stored data and uses 256 bit SSL certificates to encrypt data transferred between you and the Services.</p>\n<p>However, no system is perfectly secure or reliable, the Internet is an inherently insecure medium, and the reliability of hosting services, Internet intermediaries, your Internet service provider, and other service providers cannot be assured.\nWhen you use FreshBooks, you accept these risks, and the responsibility for choosing to use a technology that does not provide perfect security or reliability.\nIn particular, Subscribers who enable auto-billing and choose to store the credit card information of their Customers accept these risks to the security of that credit card information.\nWhen storing credit card information using the FreshBooks recurring profiles module Subscribers acknowledge that they are aware of, and accept as satisfactory, FreshBooks\u2019 credit card protection procedure.\nCredit card data is provided by Subscribers and their Customers, and they are responsible for its protection.</p>\n<p>Finally, FreshBooks provides the FreshBooks API to facilitate the use of the Services with other services on the Internet.\nIf a third party is authorized through your FreshBooks account to have access to your User Content through the FreshBooks API, we cannot control and are not responsible or liable for the third party\u2019s use of your User Content.</p>\n<p>10.\nNo Responsibility for Third-Party Services, Sites or Content</p>\n<p>As a service to our users, the Site may contain links to third-party Web sites (\u201cThird-Party Sites\u201d) or third-party content (\u201cThird-Party Content\u201d) and may provide third-party services (\u201cThird-Party Services\u201d), including payment processors and other payment intermediaries that you may use in connection with your use of the Services.\nYou use Third-Party Sites, Third-Party Content (together, the \u201cThird Party Materials\u201d) or Third-Party Services at your own risk.</p>\n<p>FreshBooks makes no
