designated by Private-Mail.\nPayment processing will be performed by a third-party compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.\nPrivate-Mail does not accept payments directly.\nThe designated third-party payment processor will collect credit card, debit card, or U.S.\nbank account information from you.\nWe will not collect, store, or have any access to your credit card, debit card, or bank account information during the payment process.\nPayments will be processed promptly.\nhowever, several factors, many of which are outside our control, will contribute to when we receive a payment from you and credit it to your account.\nWe make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete processing of a payment.</p>\n<p> If a credit card account is being used for a transaction, we may obtain preapproval for an amount up to the amount of the payment.\nIf you enroll to make recurring payments automatically, all charges and fees will be billed to the credit card you designate during the setup process.\nIf you want to designate a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card, you must change your information online.\nThis may temporarily delay your ability to make online payments while we verify your new payment information.</p>\n<p> You represent and warrant that if you are making online payments that (i) all credit card, debit card, and bank account information you supply is true, correct, and complete, (ii) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit or debit card company, as well as bank, (iii) you will pay the charges incurred by you in the amounts posted, including any applicable taxes, and (iv) you are authorized to make the payment with the credit card debit card, or bank account at issue.<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>FEES</strong>\n<br>\n<br> The Digital Services are available under subscription plans of various durations.\nAll accounts are offered as-is at the time of purchase and subject to changes in the applicable fee structure.\n&nbsp;Your subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period unless you inform us that you do not wish to renew the subscription.\nAt the time of automatic renewal, the subscription fee will be charged to the Credit Card last used by you.\nWe provide you the option of changing the details if you would like the payment for the renewal to be made through a different Credit Card.\nIf you do not wish to renew the subscription, you must inform us a reasonable period of time, no less than 72 hours, prior to the renewal date.\nIf you have not downgraded to a free plan and if you have not timely informed us that you do not wish to renew the subscription, you will be presumed to have authorized Private-Mail to charge the subscription fee to the Credit Card last used by you.\n</p>\n<p> From time to time, we may change the price of any Digital Service or charge for use of Digital Services that are currently available free of charge.\nAny increase in charges will not apply until the expiration of your then current billing cycle.\nYou will not be charged for using any Digital Service unless you have opted for a paid subscription plan.\n</p>\n<p> The Client understands that Private-Mail is not obligated to honor typographical or other pricing errors and is not responsible for information or content provided on third-party websites or affiliates.&nbsp.\nPrivate-Mail shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit or debit card charged.\nIf your credit or debit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, we shall immediately issue a credit to your credit or debit card account in the amount of the incorrect price that you were charged for any orders cancelled by Private-Mail.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Inactive User Accounts Policy</strong>\n<br>\n<br> We reserve the right to terminate unpaid user accounts (which include accounts signed up for paid service where payment has not been timely made) that are inactive for a continuous period of 120 days or more.\nIn the event of such termination, all data associated with such user account will be deleted.\nWe will provide you prior notice of such termination and the option to back-up your data.\nThe data deletion policy may be implemented with respect to any or all of the Digital Services.\nEach Digital Service will be considered an independent and separate service for the purpose of calculating the period of inactivity.\nIn other words, activity in one of the Digital Services is not sufficient to keep your user account in another Digital Service active.\nIn case of accounts with more than one user, if at least one of the users is active, the account will not be considered inactive.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>REFUND POLICY</strong>\n<br>\n<br> If you are less than 100% satisfied with the Digital Services, in most cases we will refund your payment if the refund is requested within seven (7) days from the date of the purchase.&nbsp.\nHowever, requests may be denied in certain cases, including those involving violations of this Agreement.&nbsp.\nAs another example, requests involving dedicated IPs will be denied.\nPrivate-Mail cannot guarantee that all external services will work or continue to work with your assigned dedicated or shared IPs.\n&nbsp;Refunds may also be withheld in the event of a violation of this Agreement.\nGift cards cannot be refunded to alternative payment gateways.\ncards that cannot be refunded to the source will be applied as a credit on your Private-Mail account.<br> You understand that by paying for Private-Mail service using BitCoin or another cryptocurrency as a preferred transaction method, you are using a payment means that is not backed by an official governmental entity or international financial institution, and that the payment system may be prone to fluctuations in market value in a very short period of time.\nThe Client agrees that any refunds for transactions using BitCoin or another cryptocurrency will be assessed as the lower of the BitCoin or another cryptocurrency exchange rate to USD at the time of the refund disbursement, and that at the time of the original transaction or refund request.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Website revisions &amp.\naccuracy</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Private-Mail and its service provider may from time to time revise the Digital Services and
