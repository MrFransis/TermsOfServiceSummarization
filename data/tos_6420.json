information with our service providers (sometimes referred to as \u201cprocessors\u201d or \u201csub-processors\u201d) that work on our behalf and process your personal information at our direction.\nWe require all service providers that we work with to have in place appropriate confidentiality and security measures to protect your personal information.\nService providers include businesses that assist us with data hosting, analytics, security and combatting fraud and other unlawful behavior.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third Party Networks</strong>.\nWe share End User IP addresses with third party networks who VDMS partners with to allow for the delivery of Customer content across the internet.\nThese third party networks process End User IP addresses for the sole purpose of

contact your VDMS account representative.\nIf you are a European Economic Area resident and you wish to contact our Data Protection Officer, you can do so via email at dpo-contact@yahooinc.com.\nPlease note, the platform that Yahoo provides to its consumers to manage and control their use of personal information does not work for VDMS B2B accounts.\nThis is because VDMS is a processor for personal information we process on behalf of our Customers<br>\n<br>\n<strong>6.\nInformation Security</strong>\n<br>VDMS has implemented and maintains appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction.\nor accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure.\nor access and against other unlawful

\u201coffline\u201d storage for disaster recovery purposes.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>b.\nIn addition, we may maintain de-identified data for varying periods for research, reporting and product testing or development.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>8.\nOur Legal Bases for Processing Information.\n&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>We mainly rely on three separate bases to lawfully process your information.\nFirst, we need to process your information in certain ways to perform a contract with you.\nSecond, where you have given us consent to use your personal information in certain ways (for example, VDMS marketing messages about new services), we will rely on your consent.\nThird, in certain cases, we may process your information where necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests.\nOccasionally, VDMS may rely on other legal bases to process your information, such as to protect a user\u2019s vital interests (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm) or to comply with a legal obligation.&nbsp;<br>\u200d<br>\n<strong>9.\nData Processing and
