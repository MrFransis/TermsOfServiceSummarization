third party claims relating to (a) your use of Substack (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.&nbsp.\nIn the event of such a claim, suit, or action, we will attempt to provide notice to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Assignment: You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Substack account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without our prior written consent.&nbsp.\nWe may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Choice of Law: These Terms are governed by and will be construed under applicable federal law and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver: Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration in San Francisco County, California, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.\n(\u201cJAMS\u201d)

of these Terms will be entitled to an award of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Substack Inc agree that all claims against the other can only be brought in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or other representative proceeding.\nWe agree that arbitrators may not conduct any class, consolidated, or representative proceeding, and are limited to providing relief warranted by an individual party's claim.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>No Third-Party Beneficiaries: We agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>No Joint Venture: You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Substack Inc., and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind us in any respect whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Waiver: The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Severability: If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Entire Agreement: You agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and us, and that it supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
