&amp.\nCookies Privacy Notice September 23, 2020 <p>We care about your privacy.\nWhen Mozilla (that's us) collects information about you, our Mozilla Privacy Policy describes how we handle that information.</p>\n<p>This privacy notice applies to Mozilla operated websites and mobile apps, which include the domains mozillians.org, mozilla.org, and firefox.com, among others.\nThis includes, for example, foundation.mozilla.org, bugzilla.mozilla.org, reps.mozilla.org, careers.mozilla.org, developers.mozilla.org, support.mozilla.org, addons.mozilla.org, and wiki.mozilla.org.</p> Things you should know\n<p>We may receive personal information from you based on your interaction with us on social media platforms.\nif you submit a job, intern, grant, or fellow application.\nif you volunteer as a Mozilla community member.\nif you submit user feedback or a request to us.\nif you sign up for an account or for a subscription.\nor if you engage with a product or policy campaign.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media</strong>: If you engage with our social media accounts, such as Twitter and Facebook, we may receive personal information about you.\nIf you use these networks, their privacy policies apply, and you are encouraged to read them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Job, Intern, Grant &amp.\nFellow Applicants</strong>: Applicants for employment, internship, grant, or fellowship opportunities with Mozilla are required to give us a name, street address, telephone number, email address, and resume, and sometimes additional information as well.\nWe use this information to process and evaluate applications and to communicate with applicants about opportunities.\nWe use Greenhouse to handle employment and intern applications, and Fluxx.io to handle fellowship and MOSS grant applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Contributors</strong>: Volunteering for Mozilla as a community contributor may require Mozilla and others to communicate with you at the email address that you provide in connection to your contribution and to recognize your efforts.\nIf you contribute to Bugzilla, Mozilla Reps, or our code base, then your email address and possibly your name will be publicly available to all internet users.\nIf you create a profile at Mozillians.org, it will be accessible to Mozilla employees and Mozilla contributors.\nYou can edit your profile data at Profile Settings.\nWe sometimes use contributor information from sources (such as Bugzilla) in dashboards to visually share aggregated data on the Mozilla community.\nAn example is https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Dashboards.\nIf possible, we try to minimize contact information that is publicly displayed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>User Feedback</strong>: You can provide feedback to us on our products and services on webpages like input.mozilla.org, through an in-product experience, or through channels such as email, Bugzilla, Matrix, a social media account, our Get Involved page, or through a group like Student Ambassadors.\nPlease minimize the personal information you choose to share on these forums because your comments may be accessible to the public.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Accounts &amp.\nSubscriptions</strong>: Some websites, for example AMO and MDN require account creation to submit developer content or submit user reviews or comments.\nFor account management we use Firefox Accounts, Github, or custom systems.\nsee here to manage account data.\nYou may periodically receive emails in connection with your account or through subscriptions.\nOur email management vendors are SalesForce Marketing Cloud, Send in Blue, or Mailchimp, and you can unsubscribe using the link at the bottom of the email.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Product &amp.\nPolicy Campaigns</strong>: Some of our webpages host product or policy campaigns.\nFor example, you can request a link by email or SMS to install Firefox on your mobile device or petition your legislators on internet issues.\nWe may use third parties to manage these campaigns and handle any data that you choose to submit.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may use cookies, clear GIFs, third party web analytics, device information, and IP addresses for functionality and to better understand user interaction with our products, services, and communications.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Functionality</strong>: We may use information such as cookies, device information, and IP addresses to enhance functionality of certain products, services, and communications.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use cookies to remember information about your Firefox settings (such as language preference and Firefox add-ons), and so that we can recommend relevant features and Add-ons to you based on your Firefox settings.\nThey also assist with user sign-in and authentication so you can bypass re-entering your passwords on certain Mozilla websites.</li>\n<li>We use IP addresses to customize communications by language and country.</li>\n<li>We use certain device information such as country, language, operator and OEM, to customize your experience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Metrics</strong>: We may also use cookies, device information, and IP addresses, along with clear GIFs, cookies and third party services to help us understand in the aggregate how users engage with our products, services, communications, websites, online campaigns, snippets, devices, and other platforms.\nWe use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Analytics, which places a cookie on your device, to obtain metrics on how users engage with our websites.\nThis helps us to improve site content.</li>\n<li>Convert.com and ShareProgress, which place a cookie on your device, to help us test variations of web content.\nThis helps us offer better web experiences to users.</li>\n<li>DoubleClick and Flashtalking, each of which uses a clear GIF on our download Firefox page.\nThis helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</li>\n<li>Yahoo Dot Pixel, which uses JavaScript on our download Firefox page.\nThis helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</li>\n<li>HTTP Referral Data, which may be included with Firefox\u2019s installer, to understand the website domain or advertising campaign that referred you to our download page.\nThis information helps us understand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and improve them.</li>\n<li>Other metrics tools from time to time, on an experimental basis.\nFor example, we may do this to help evaluate a new metrics tool, or test existing metrics collection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Fraud Prevention</strong>: Mozilla has implemented third-party technology, Google\u2019s Invisible reCAPTCHA, that operates in the background on some of our websites in order to identify fraudulent activity.\nUse of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is governed by the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can control individual cookie preferences, indicate your cookie preferences to others, and opt-out of web analytics and optimization tools.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookie History</strong>: You can accept or decline individual cookies in your Firefox preferences in the Tools/Options/Privacy history section.\nNote that certain features of our products and services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Not Track</strong>: Mozilla does not track users across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.\nIf you have configured your browser to send a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal when accessing our websites, Mozilla will not utilize any of the tools described in the Metrics section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Email</strong>: Our marketing communications are optional to receive and you can unsubscribe from the footer of the email or by updating your Mozilla email preferences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics &amp.\nOptimization</strong>: Follow the instructions below to prevent data collection about your visits to Mozilla websites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google: Install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, which prohibits data transmission to Google Analytics.\nSome Mozilla.org pages use clear GIFs which communicate with DoubleClick to understand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.\nyou can control personalized ads from DoubleClick in Google's ad settings (you will be prompted to sign into your Google Account).</li>\n<li>Convert.com: Opt-out on www.mozilla.org.</li>\n<li>Yahoo: Visit the Ad Interest Manager to opt-out.</li>\n<li>ShareProgress and Fathom.com: You can turn on Do Not Track in your browser.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media</strong>: The social sharing buttons on Mozilla websites are designed not to share data with the social media provider until you specifically click the button.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some Mozilla websites allow you to make purchases (such as apps or gear), contribute funds to specific Mozilla projects, or make donations in support of Mozilla public and charitable programs.\nThese transactions are often handled by Mozilla\u2019s third party vendors.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Payment Processing</strong>: Except for payments made by check, money order, and direct debit, and wire transfers, Mozilla does not receive any financial information, which is transmitted from you to the named third party vendor for processing (e.g., Braintree, PayPal, Bitpay, Stripe).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal Data</strong>: We may also receive your name, mailing address, and/or email address.\nThis data is used for fraud detection and record-keeping.\nWe use SalesForce Marketing Cloud to email receipts and store records, which are retained for four years from the date of last payment.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Data</strong>: We use WealthEngine to improve our fundraising efforts to keep the internet healthy, open, and accessible for all.\nDonors can opt-out of Mozilla\u2019s use.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Company <ul>\n<li>Mozilla Manifesto</li>\n<li>Press Center</li>\n<li>Corporate Blog</li>\n<li>Careers</li>\n<li>Contact</li>\n<li>Donate</li>\n</ul>

these principles shape Firefox and all of our products in this FAQ.\n</p> Transparency Report <p>As an open source project, transparency and openness are an essential part of Mozilla\u2019s founding principles.\nOur codebases are open and auditable.\nOur development work is open.\nOur bi-annual Transparency Report also demonstrates our commitment to these principles.</p> Get Involved <p> To review and comment on proposed changes to our privacy policies, subscribe to Mozilla\u2019s governance group.\n</p>\n<p> Read more about our ongoing privacy and security public policy work on Mozilla's Open Policy and Advocacy Blog.\n</p> Outdated Policies Mozilla Privacy Policy September 9, 2020 What do we mean by \"personal information?\"\n<p>For us, \"personal information\" means information which either directly identifies you (like your name, email address, or billing information) or can be reasonably linked or combined to identify you (like an account identification number or IP address).\nWe\u2019ll always tell you what personal information we\u2019re collecting from you.\nSee each product\u2019s Privacy Notice for specific details.</p>\n<p>Any information that falls outside of this is \"non-personal information.\"</p>\n<p>If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information.\nIf we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.</p>\nHow do we learn information about you?\n<p>We learn information about you when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash reports);</li>\n<li>we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., when your Firefox browser checks with us to see if is up to date);</li>\n<li>someone else tells us information about you (e.g., when Thunderbird works with your email providers to set up your account).\nor</li>\n<li>when we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize language for some of our services).</li>\n</ul>\nWhat do we do with your information once we have it?\n<p>When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission.\nGenerally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.</p>\n<p>For users in the EU, EEA, Switzerland, and California: see here for more information.</p>\nWhen do we share your information with others?\n<ul>\n<li>When we have asked and received your permission to share it.</li>\n<li>For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla.</li>\n<li>When we are fulfilling our mission of being open.\nWe sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web, but when we do so, we will remove your personal information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.</li>\n<li>When the law requires it.\nWe follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit.\nWe'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so.\nWhen we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so.\nNothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.</li>\n<li>When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else.\nWe will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Mozilla or the public.</li>\n<li>If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.</li>\n</ul>\nHow do we store and protect your personal information?\n<p>We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it.\nWe implement physical, business and technical security measures.\nDespite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.</p>\n<p>We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for.\nOnce we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.</p>\nWhat if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?\n<p>We may need to change this policy and our notices.\nThe updates will be posted online.\nIf the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums.\nYour continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.\nTo make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.</p> Contact Mozilla <p>If you want to make a correction to your information, or you have any questions about our privacy policies, please get in touch with:</p>\n<p> Mozilla

privacy and confidentiality.\nWe will also protect people who report to you.</p>\n<p>The intended audiences for this document are employees transitioning their gender in the workplace, managers and colleagues of people who are transitioning, and interested Mozillians.</p>\n<p>If you need assistance with any of the guidelines in this document, or would like to have a conversation about

Workplace Gender Transition Guidelines, are not intended to label employees, but rather to assist in understanding this policy and the legal obligations of employers.\nEmployees may or may not use these terms to describe themselves.\nFor more information on terminology, visit the National Center for Transgender Equality\u2019s website.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Gender identity:</b> A person\u2019s internal, deeply felt sense of being male, female, or something other or in-between, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth.\nEveryone has a gender identity.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Gender expression:</b> An individual\u2019s characteristics and behaviors (such as appearance, dress, mannerisms, speech patterns, and social interactions) that may be perceived as masculine, feminine, both, or neither.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Cisgender:</b> An umbrella term that describes people whose gender identity and/or expression corresponds to their sex assigned at birth.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Transgender:</b> An umbrella term used to describe people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from their sex assigned at birth.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>A person whose sex assigned at birth was female but who identifies as male is a transgender man.</li>\n<li>A person whose sex assigned at birth was male but who identifies as female is a transgender woman.</li>\n<li>Some people described by this definition don\u2019t consider themselves transgender\u2014they may use other words, or may identify simply as a man or woman.\nMozilla prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender, sex, and gender expression regardless of whether someone identifies as transgender.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Gender non-conforming:</b> This term refers to individuals whose gender identity or expression exists outside of the gender binary of woman or man.\nThis includes, for example, nonbinary, gender-fluid, gender creative, genderqueer, gender non-conforming, and agender people.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This figure, produced by TransFocus, illustrates the spectrums of sex assigned at birth, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>It is important to note that everyone has a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sex assigned at birth</li>\n<li>Gender identity</li>\n<li>Gender expression</li>\n<li>Sexual orientation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are a few more definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Transition:</b> The process some transgender people go through to begin living as the gender with which they identify, rather than the sex assigned to them at birth.\nThis may or may not include changes in name and pronoun, bathroom and facility usage, participation in activities such as sports teams, hormone therapy, sex reassignment surgery, or other medical procedures.\nThere are many different ways to transition.\nFor some people, it is a complex process that takes place over a long period of time, while for others it is a one- or two-step process that happens more quickly.\nTransition may include coming out (telling family, friends, and coworkers).\nchanging the name and/or sex on legal documents.\nand, for many transgender people, accessing medical treatment such as hormones and surgery.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Sexual orientation:</b> Refers to the identities or groups of identities you are attracted to sexually.\nStraight, gay, and bisexual are some ways to describe sexual orientation.\nIt is important to note that sexual orientation is distinct from gender identity and expression.\nTransgender people can be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight, just like cisgender people.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>LGBT:</b> A common abbreviation that refers to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Community Participation Guidelines</b>\n<p>The Community Participation Guidelines (CPG) outline what\u2019s necessary to help us create a safe and positive community experience for all.\nThe CPG explicitly includes gender, gender identity, and expression.\nIt also states that Mozillians should be inclusive of everyone in an interaction when they are using pronouns other than \u201che\u201d or \u201cshe,\u201d such as someone who uses \u201cthey\u201d or \u201cze\u201d as pronouns, or someone who does not use pronouns at all.\nIt\u2019s in the spirit of the CPG to be respectful of the different ways that people might want to be addressed.\nMozilla requires that Mozillians address each other by their preferred pronouns, if known.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Note: While the CPG doesn\u2019t explicitly address non-binary gender expression, it is implicitly covered in the guidelines.</i>\n</p>\n<b>Reporting harassment</b>\n<p>Discrimination based on gender identity or expression is not tolerated at Mozilla.\nThe CPG states that derogatory, hurtful, or harmful language is not tolerated.\nThis includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual\u2019s gender identity.\nThis could also include being dead named (using someone\u2019s birth name instead of their chosen name) or someone not respecting a person\u2019s pronouns.\nIf you experience or witness harassment, report it.\nSee the Open Door Policy page for information on how to report in your country.</p>\nRights and responsibilities\n<p>There are rights, expectations, and responsibilities of each party associated with a transition in the workplace.\nIt is essential that open and honest communication be established to build trust for each party.\nWith each right also comes responsibility or an expectation.\nA successful transition in the workplace can occur only with commitment and understanding of each involved part.</p>\n<b>Transitioning individual</b>\n<p>If you are the transitioning employee, you have the right to work openly and authentically.\nThis means that you may express your gender identity, characteristics, or expression without fear of consequences by Mozilla.</p>\n<p>It is important for you to advocate for yourself.\nYou are not required to tell anyone at Mozilla.\nhowever, if you choose to disclose, the first step is to inform key personnel who can assist you.\nYour initial point of contact may be your supervisor, a member of the People Team, or a member of the Diversity and Inclusion Team.\nNote that if you choose to disclose, at some point, your immediate supervisor, manager, or People Team representative becomes part of your support team.</p>\n<p>Remember, Mozilla employees are covered under both the Community Participation Guidelines (CPG) and Mozilla\u2019s Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policies, but Mozilla must be aware of your situation in order to provide support.\nExplain your intentions, needs, and concerns to your manager or People Partner.\nIn reporting any situation where you are not feeling comfortable at work, it helps your manager or People Partner to understand what result or change you wish to see.\nIn addition, the Diversity and Inclusion Team can support you with resources or by being an additional support and resource for your manager and team.</p>\n<b>Managers</b>\n<p>Mozilla\u2019s culture supports diversity and inclusion.\nIf someone who reports to you informs you of their desire to transition, or if an individual in your workplace is currently in the transition process, your support is critical.\nBelow are tips to reflect your support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are unfamiliar with the transition process, leverage coaching and resources available to you through the Diversity and Inclusion Team or your People Partner.\nFor supervisors, you can use these guidelines to further educate your staff.</li>\n<li>Listen carefully to what the individual is telling you and how they\u2019d like to be treated (Do they want to keep their transition as quiet as possible or do they wish to celebrate publicly?)</li>\n<li>When meeting with the transitioning individual about their needs and concerns, remain respectful and open-minded.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you oversee, manage or lead an employee who is transitioning, it is important that you demonstrate an understanding of (and use a sensitive approach to) their needs and concerns.\nIt may be challenging for transitioning individuals to make themselves vulnerable to a person upon whom their job depends.\nMake it clear that you will not gossip and only share information where there is a legitimate need to know.\nManagers should use discretion and be as confidential and discreet as possible.\nFor example, if you need to contact your People Partner do not copy extraneous people to the email.\nBefore referring to your employee by their new name or pronouns on an email list, Slack or IRC, confirm with them that this is appropriate.\nExplain questions and concerns you might have and ask their opinion on matters covered in subsequent sections Additional considerations on the Creating a Plan Worksheet and on putting together a plan for transitioning at work.\nBe prepared to have open conversations with your staff to answer any of their questions regarding the transition process.</p>\n<p>Mozilla requires all managers and colleagues to use the transitioning individual\u2019s preferred gender pronoun.\nPlease note that pronouns are not limited to \u201cshe\u201d or \u201che,\u201d but can also include other non-binary pronouns such as \u201cthey\u201d or \u201cze.\u201d</p>\n<b>Developing a plan</b>\n<p>Discuss the expected timeline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the individual will begin their transition at work.\nThis will probably be the point at which the individual begins to present in accordance with their gender identity, including change of name, pronouns, dress, grooming, appearance, and restroom use.</li>\n<li>When to inform various stakeholders.</li>\n<li>Anticipated time off required for medical treatment, if known.\nSince benefits may vary depending on your coverage, contact the Head of Global Benefits for more information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Diversity and Inclusion Team works in partnership with the People Partners to support staff who are transitioning.</p>\n<b>Addressing concerns of coworkers and clients</b>\n<p>If you\u2019re a supervisor, you can reference these guidelines when communicating about transition-related topics with your team.\nIf additional questions or concerns arise that are not covered by these guidelines, contact the Diversity and Inclusion Team.</p>\n<b>Creating a plan</b>\n<p>A plan can help facilitate a smooth transition process.\nThe Creating a Plan (CAP) worksheet lists potential items of consideration for the transitioning employee, along with estimated timelines.\nPlease note that not all gender transition \u201csteps\u201d occur in the same way, or in the same order.\nSome items in the CAP sheet may happen in a different way or order, depending on the individual\u2019s particular situation.\nThe CAP sheet merely functions as an overview of various steps that an individual might consider in the gender transition process.\nIt is not intended as a definitive document or a checklist that requires strict adherence.</p>\n<b>Putting together a stakeholders list</b>\n<p>If you are a transitioning individual, you might consider the following questions related to stakeholders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who are all the people (internal and external) that you may need to engage at some point during your transition?</li>\n<li>When do they need to be engaged?</li>\n<li>Are there any specific issues that must be addressed sooner rather than later?</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Creating a timeline</b>\n<p>As a transitioning employee, it can be useful to review a list of possible action items to consider before transitioning.\nThese steps can be tailored according to the individual\u2019s own time frame and are just a suggestion of one way to approach transitioning at work.\nIf you are a transitioning employee and need assistance with developing your plan, contact your People Partner.</p>\n<p>At some point in the process, the transitioning individual may want to legally change their name.\nFor more information on legal identity change in the US, refer to the document ID Please from the Transgender Law Center.</p>\nSpecific policies and guidelines\n<b>Privacy</b>\n<p>Transgender employees have the right to discuss their gender identity or expression openly, or to keep that information private.\nThe transgender employee gets to decide when, with whom, and how much to share their private information.</p>\n<p>Under Mozilla\u2019s Community Participation Guidelines (CPG), we expect Mozillians to respect the privacy of all individuals, including transgender individuals.</p>\n<p>Management, the People Team, and coworkers should not disclose information that may reveal an employee\u2019s transgender status or gender non-conforming presentation to others who do not have a legitimate need to know.</p>\n<b>Names and pronouns</b>\n<p>An employee should be addressed by the name and pronoun that correspond to the employee\u2019s gender identity, upon request.\na court-ordered name or gender change is not required.\nThe intentional or persistent refusal to respect an employee\u2019s gender identity (for example, intentionally referring to the employee by a name or pronoun that does not correspond to the employee\u2019s gender identity) can constitute harassment and is a violation of Mozilla\u2019s CPG and anti-harassment policies.\nIf you are unsure what pronoun a transitioning coworker might prefer, you can politely ask your coworker how they would like to be addressed.</p>\n<p>See Sage Sharp\u2019s post in Additional resources\u2014it includes examples of ways to talk about someone who has transitioned in a respectful manner.</p>\n<b>Official records</b>\n<p>Mozilla will change an employee\u2019s official record to reflect a change in name or gender upon request from the employee.\nCertain types of records, like those relating to payroll and retirement accounts, may require a legal name change before the person\u2019s name can be changed.\nMozilla may also not be legally able to change some records.\nMany records, however, can be changed to reflect a person\u2019s preferred name without proof of a legal name change.\nFor specifics, see Creating a Plan worksheet.</p>\n<p>We will update any photographs that the transitioning employee identifies in the workplace that are Mozilla\u2019s possession and that Mozilla has the right to unilaterally alter, so the transitioning employee\u2019s gender identity and expression are represented.\nIf a new or transitioning employee has questions about company records or ID documents, the employee should contact their People Partner.</p>\n<b>Restroom and locker room access</b>\n<p>At Mozilla offices, transitioning employees have the right to use the restroom or locker room that corresponds to the employee\u2019s gender identity or gender expression, regardless of the employee\u2019s sex assigned at birth.\nThe transitioning employee knows their gender better than the person objecting does.</p>\n<p>Mozilla office spaces offer gender-neutral restrooms wherever possible.\nHere is the status for each office as of July 2018:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Vancouver:</b> One gender-neutral restroom in-suite.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Toronto: </b>Two gender-neutral restrooms in-suite.</li>\n<li>\n<b>London:</b> Two gender-neutral restrooms on the building\u2019s ground floor as well as accessible restrooms on each floor of the building.\nNo in-suite restrooms.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Paris:</b> Gender-neutral restrooms in-suite on 1st, ground, and half-floors.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Berlin:</b> Gender-neutral restrooms in-suite on the 3rd and 4th floor.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Taipei:</b> Gender-labeled restrooms on each floor, outside of office suite.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Mountain View:</b> Gender-labeled restrooms on 1st and 2nd floors.\nCurrently there is no gender-neutral restroom in MTV.</li>\n<li>\n<b>San Francisco:</b> Gender-neutral restrooms in 1st floor commons area and one set of gender-labeled restrooms.\n2nd and 3rd floor building restrooms are gender labeled.\n7th floor restrooms are in-suite and also gender labeled.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Portland: </b>Gender-neutral restroom in-suite.\nGender-labeled restrooms outside of office suite.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This 11-minute TED talk by author Ivan E.\nCoyote titled Why we need gender-neutral bathrooms is great.</p>\n<b>Benefits and leave</b>\n<p>As benefits vary from country to country, contact the Head of Global Benefits.</p>\n<b>Travel</b>\n<p>Mozilla has pocket-sized cards that staff can print and carry with them when traveling.</p>\n<b>Authorship</b>\n<p>See Creating a Plan worksheet for more details about updating authorship on previous work.</p>\nCreating a plan worksheet\n<p>This worksheet, based on Appendix A of the Berkeley Lab Guidelines, is a list of potential items to consider, along with estimated timelines.\nPlease note that not all gender transition \u201csteps\u201d occur in the same way, or in the same order.\nSome items in the Creating a Plan (CAP) sheet may occur in a different way or order, depending on the individual\u2019s particular situation.\nThe CAP worksheet merely functions as an overview of various steps that an individual might consider in the gender transition process.\nIt is not intended as a definitive document or a checklist that requires strict adherence.</p>\n<b>Additional considerations</b>\n<p>The following are additional considerations for the transitioning employee:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which of these possible steps are important to you? Do you want to come out at work? Not telling people is an option, too.</li>\n<li>Consider any unintended consequences.\nFor example, a new subscriber ID from your insurance company may result in cancellation of pending claims, preauthorization approvals, or dependent claims, and/or may impact your selected primary care physician.</li>\n<li>When will you need to process any necessary changes to other items, such as professional licenses, publications, degrees, credentials, etc.?</li>\n<li>Search for your current name in various Mozilla web pages for working groups and other references.\nWhich pages will need to be altered or removed?</li>\n<li>Informing your supervisor: if and when you feel comfortable and safe to come out.\nNot telling people at work is an option, too.</li>\n<li>Informing the people you work with: if and when you feel comfortable and safe to come out.\nNot telling people at work is an option, too.\nHow would you like your team to find out about your transition (for example, a letter, a face-to-face meeting, individual discussions, your supervisor explaining)? If in person or over video, who do you want in the room?</li>\n<li>Coming out\u2014telling everyone who works with you (collaborators, internal clients, external vendors, relevant communities): if and when you feel comfortable and safe to come out.\nNot telling people at work is an option, too.\nHow would you like to inform your stakeholders, clients, and/or users?</li>\n<li>Update name and photo in the phonebook</li>\n<li>Update name and photo on Mozilla access badge</li>\n<li>Update nameplate on desk, if in an office</li>\n<li>Update name and photo in Mozilla Community Directory</li>\n<li>Update LDAP and computer user name</li>\n<li>Update miscellaneous user names (Slack, IRC, Github, AWS)</li>\n<li>Update SSH keys to reflect updated emails</li>\n<li>Update user name on software (enterprise) purchases.\nConsult with IT to determine what is needed for enterprise software that is either a subscription service or uses a license key.</li>\n<li>Update commit histories in hg and GitHub</li>\n<li>Update display name on Jive phone account</li>\n<li>Update name in HR information system</li>\n<li>Email Payroll to give them the heads-up about a name change.\nFor Canada and US staff, our payroll vendor houses only bank account numbers, so it\u2019s possible to update your payroll name without updating the name on your bank account.\nFor staff in other countries, ask Payroll.</li>\n<li>Updating authorship on Mozilla blogs to reflect the new name</li>\n<li>Legal name change process.\nThis will vary depending on where you live.</li>\n<li>Update name and gender on passport.\nThis will vary depending on where you live.\nThis might not be possible in all countries.</li>\n<li>Update traveler name, gender and title (Ms., Mrs., Mr., etc.) in our travel system.\nYour travel documents (passport, etc.) must be updated before you change your details in our travel system.\nWhen traveling, your ID must match the name on your ticket.\nGender markers or \u201cTitle\u201d (e.g., Ms., Mrs., Mr., or Dr.) are not required in the account for anyone with an account in Egencia Americas.\nIt is required for account creation in our travel system UK + EMEA, France, Germany, or APAC.\nthe Title is available only as Mr., Mrs., or Ms.\n(no Dr.).</li>\n<li>Contact Benefits to see if you should update your name and gender on your health
