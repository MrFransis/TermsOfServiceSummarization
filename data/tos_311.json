carefully.\nThese Terms form a legally binding contract between you (or your organization) and Snap Inc.\n(\u201cSnap\u201d), and govern your order for Snap to run a lens or filter (each, a \u201cCreative Tool\u201d).\nThe products and services described in these terms are \u201cServices\u201d as defined in the Snap Inc.\nTerms of Service.\nIf you are located in the United States when you submit an order for Snap to run a Creative Tool, or if you are using the Services on behalf of a business with its principal place of business located in the United States, these Terms govern your order.\nIf you are located outside the United States when you submit an order for Snap to run a Creative Tool or are using the Services on behalf of a business with its principal place of business located outside the United States, the Snap Group Limited Custom Creative Tools Terms apply.</p>\n<p>Please print a copy of these Terms and keep them for your reference.</p>\n<p>These Terms incorporate by reference the Snap Inc.\nTerms of Service, Community Guidelines, Snapchat Brand Guidelines, Snapcode Usage Guidelines, Advertising Policies, and Custom Creative Tools Submission Guidelines so please read each of them carefully.\nAmong other things, that means your order for Snap to run a Creative Tool is subject to the disclaimers and limitations of liability in the Snap Inc.\nTerms of Service.\nPlease also review our Privacy Policy to learn how we handle information when you use the Services.\nTo the extent these Terms conflict with the Snap Inc.\nTerms of Service, Community Guidelines, Snapchat Brand Guidelines, Snapcode Usage Guidelines, Advertising Policies, or Custom Creative Tools Submission Guidelines, these Terms govern.</p> 1.\nThe Basics <p>When you submit your order for Snap to run a Creative Tool, you\u2019re asking Snap to let Snapchat users put the Creative Tool on their Snaps.\nYou\u2019ll design the proposed Creative Tool and submit it as an image file for our review.\nSnap may allow you to edit or replace the image file after submission (the initial image file, and any edits or replacements, are collectively called the \u201cAsset\u201d).\nWe will notify you of any additional charges before you submit your revised or replacement Asset.\nThe version of these Terms posted on the website when you submit an Asset will apply to that submission.\nYou grant Snap and our affiliates a license to use and copy the Asset to distribute the Creative Tool and for other purposes, as described in these Terms.\nAnd you may be asked whether you\u2019re buying a personal or business Creative Tool.</p>\n<p>These Terms spell out all these steps and include other important provisions, including details about payment, refunds, and cancellations.\nTo submit your order for Snap to run a Creative Tool, you must first accept these Terms, which will be presented to you during the submission process.</p>\n<p>You affirm that you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority where you are located when submitting your order) and are competent and authorized to agree to and abide by these Terms.\nIf you want to submit an order for Snap to run a Creative Tool and are under the age of majority, you must have your parent\u2019s express permission.</p>\n<p>If you are using the Services on behalf of a business, you affirm that you are authorized to grant all licenses set forth in these Terms and to agree to these Terms on behalf of the business.\nYou agree that the terms \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour,\u201d as used throughout these Terms, apply to both you and the business, as applicable.</p>\n<p>As part of the purchase process, you\u2019ll be asked to submit the Asset for our review.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Snap will determine, in our sole discretion, whether the Asset will be made available as a Creative Tool.</p> 2.\nYour License to Us <p>You grant Snap and its affiliates a non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to archive, copy, cache, encode, store, reproduce, record, sell, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, synchronize, adapt, edit, modify, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, republish, promote, exhibit, create derivative works based upon, and otherwise use the Asset on or in connection with the Services and the advertising, marketing, and promotion thereof, in all formats, on or through any means or media now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed.\nThis license includes the right for Snap and its affiliates to make the Asset available to Snapchat users, for sharing among Snapchat users, and for saving to their devices.\nThe license to make the Asset available to Snapchat users as a Creative Tool within the Services extends 90 days following the date when the Creative Tool run time on the Services ends, in order to allow us to deliver unopened Snaps that include the Creative Tool.\nThe license extends perpetually for the limited purposes of advertising, marketing, and promoting the Services, and for Personal Custom Creative Tools, for Memories on Snapchat.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that Snapchat users may be able to save, share, and view Snaps incorporating the Creative Tool during and beyond the Creative Tool\u2019s run time.\nYou acknowledge that Snapchat users may use the Asset for purposes or in ways other than you anticipated.\nYou agree that such uses constitute user-generated content for which neither Snap nor its affiliates bear any responsibility.\nYou agree that neither Snap nor its affiliates are liable for any claims or losses based on or arising from any user-generated content, including user-generated content that makes use of the Asset, whether within the Services or beyond.</p>\n<p>If you incorporate your or any third party\u2019s name, logo, trademark, likeness, image, visual work, music, sound effect, or other materials (collectively, \u201cAdditional Elements\u201d) into the Asset, you agree that this license includes all Additional Elements.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that Snap and its affiliates own all rights in the Creative Tool products and in any additional tools we may make available to you to create your Asset (such as templates or Bitmojis).</p>\n<p>You agree that neither Snap nor its affiliates are under any obligation to pay you or any third party any consideration or compensation for the Asset or any use of the Asset.\nTo the extent permissible under law, you irrevocably waive\u2014or agree not to assert against Snap and its affiliates to the extent a waiver is not permitted\u2014any moral rights or equivalent rights you may have in the Asset throughout the world.\nYou agree that Snap may in our discretion resize, set the transparency of, and make other alterations to the Asset.</p>\n<p>If Snap makes the Asset available on the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Snap has the right (but no obligation) to publicly attribute the Asset to you, including by posting your name and city, state, and country, as submitted by you or as tied to your Snapchat account.</p> 3.\nAsset Content Restrictions <p>The Asset must comply with our Custom Creative Tools Submission Guidelines and our Community Guidelines and Advertising Policies.\nAnything prohibited as ad content by us is prohibited as a Creative Tool, and anything restricted as an ad is restricted as a Creative Tool.\nFor inquiries about buying a Creative Tool that includes a product listed in the restricted ads category, contact create-support@snap.com.</p>\n<p>Snap may provide you the option to age-target the Creative Tool.\nThis means we may make the Creative Tool available only to those Snapchat users who we reasonably believe fall within the age range you select in the purchase tool.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Snapchat users who apply age-targeted Creative Tools to their Snaps will be able to send those Snaps to other Snapchat users without age restriction.\nIf the content of the Creative Tool requires age-targeting by law, rule, regulation, or industry standards in the region where the Creative Tool will run, you are responsible for selecting the correct age in the purchase tool, and we will not be liable if you fail to do so.\nIf a required age-targeting option is not available, do not submit your order.</p> 4.\nOrders, Pricing, and Availability <p>a.\nOrders.\nWe\u2019ll indicate in the purchase tool the first date when the Creative Tool could start to run.</p>\n<p>We may offer you the option to have the Creative Tool run on an automatically renewing basis, with recurring billing as indicated in the purchase tool.\nIf you select this option, the Creative Tool may run until cancelled or you decline to renew the Creative Tool.</p>\n<p>b.\nPricing.\nWe price Creative Tools in our discretion based on a number of factors, including how long and over how large an area you want the Creative Tool to run.\nYou can see the price adjust as you manipulate the size, location, and run time for the Creative Tool in the purchase tool.\nWe may also offer an option that lets you more generally select a location and time to run a Creative Tool, leaving it to us to define the geographic area, duration, and price.\nWe may change, suspend, or end any service, or modify prices prospectively, in our discretion.\nYou\u2019ll always see the final purchase price before you click to submit your order and enter into a contract with us.\nFor automatically renewing Creative Tool purchases, we will notify you in advance of any price changes that will take effect at the beginning of the next renewal period.\nTo the extent permitted by local law, you are deemed to accept the then-current price if you do not cancel the renewal in accordance with the cancellation policy then in effect.\nIf you do not wish to accept the renewal or the price change, you may cancel prior to the renewal going into effect.\nPlease be sure to carefully read any notifications we send regarding changes to price, these Terms, and any other offers.</p>\n<p>c.\nAvailability.\nSnap does not guarantee Creative Tool availability over all areas.\nKeep in mind that we may, and likely will, run multiple Creative Tools over any one location.\nWe reserve the right in our discretion to block certain areas without notice.\nPlease refer to Section 8 for information relating to refunds and cancellations.</p> 5.\nOur Review of the Proposed Creative Tool <p>When you submit your order, that doesn\u2019t mean the Creative Tool will be made available on the Services.\nSnap may reject a proposed Creative Tool if it violates the Asset Content Restrictions in Section 3, or for any other reason in our discretion.\nRefunds for rejected orders are described in Section 8.</p> 6.\nYour Purchase and Payment <p>a.\nPayment Methods.\nSnap accepts a variety of payment methods, as reflected in the purchase tool.\nBefore you can submit your order for Snap to run a Creative Tool, you may be required to provide a valid payment card number and associated information for a payment card that you are authorized to use, including any or all of the following: (i) your name as it appears on the card.\n(ii) the credit or debit card type.\n(iii) the card\u2019s expiration date.\n(iv) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card.\nand (v) the billing address or zip code or postal code associated with the card.\nYou authorize Snap and our payment processor, or your in-app purchasing provider, as applicable, to use information you submit to charge your card or other payment method for the price of the Creative Tool you submitted, in addition to any taxes, fees, and charges as described in these Terms at our convenience, including as early as at the time the order is submitted.\nIn the event the charge does not go through, you may be able to re-submit a payment method before the Creative Tool is scheduled to run.</p>\n<p>For automatically renewing Creative Tools, we\u2019ll charge your payment method before the renewal time unless the Creative Tool is cancelled or you decline to renew the Creative Tool.</p>\n<p>Your payment will be processed before the Creative Tool runs.\nIf you are paying by payment card, we or our third-party payment processor may run one or more payment card authorization checks on your card before then.\nYou authorize us or our third-party payment processor to store your payment card information and, if needed, to continue billing your card until the Creative Tool run time has expired to avoid interruptions in running the Creative Tool.</p>\n<p>If Snap does not receive payment from your payment card or other payment method issuer or their agent, you remain obligated and agree to pay all amounts due upon request from Snap or our agents.</p>\n<p>b.\nAccount Codes/Credits.\nSnap may on occasion provide a code, credit, coupon, or other form of discount in an amount and on terms and restrictions as provided by us.</p>\n<p>c.\nCost, Fees, and Taxes.\nPlease confirm that all details of your submission are correct before submitting your order.\nWhen you submit your order, you agree to pay the cost of the Creative Tool, plus applicable taxes, fees, and charges, and, in the case of automatically renewing Creative Tools, the then-current price at the time of renewal (unless the Creative Tool is cancelled or you decline to renew the Creative Tool).\nIf United States sales and use taxes are owed but not included in the total amount you agree to pay, Snap or your in-app purchasing provider, as applicable, will pay those sales or use taxes and remit them to the appropriate taxing authority.\nFailure to pay the cost stated may result in termination or suspension of the Creative Tool.\nWe do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.</p>\n<p>You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your submission, at the rates in effect when the fees and charges were incurred.\nFor example, if you purchase with a payment card issued through a bank based outside the United States, your bank may charge you foreign transaction fees and other similar fees.</p>\n<p>d.\nOther Payment Terms.\nYour payment card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and your in-app purchasing provider\u2019s terms govern your use of in-app purchasing tools.\nYou must refer to your agreements with those third parties, and not these Terms, to determine the rights and liabilities as between you and those third parties.</p>\n<p>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY UNAUTHORIZED AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD BY A THIRD PARTY.</p>\n<p>Except for an in-app submission, unless you notify us of any discrepancies within 60 days after they first appear on your payment card or other payment statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you.</p> 7.\nCommunications from Us <p>When you submit your order for Snap to run a Creative Tool, we\u2019ll send you an electronic notification using the contact information submitted by you, or tied to your Snapchat account, as applicable.\nThat confirmation does not mean we\u2019ve accepted your submission.\nWe reserve the right to accept or decline your request for any reason and at any time, including after the Creative Tool has started to run.\nWe may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order.</p>\n<p>We may send you other electronic notifications about the Creative Tool order, including about status, payment processing, refunds, price changes for automatically renewing Creative Tools, and any changes, updates, or cancellations to your order.\nWe may also send electronic notifications about the Creative Tool products or our other products or services.\nBy submitting an order for Snap to run a Creative Tool, you consent to receive from Snap and its affiliates the electronic communications described in these Terms.</p>\n<p>You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p> 8.\nCancellations and Refunds <p>a.\nOur Right to Cancel.\nSnap reserves the right to reject or cancel the Creative Tool at any time, including after the Creative Tool has started to run, because we\u2019ve blocked a certain area (see Section 4), because you or the Creative Tool violate our terms or guidelines (see Sections 3 and 5), because payment is not completed, or for any other reason in our discretion.\nMoreover, while we do our best to describe our products as accurately as possible, we do not warrant that specifications or pricing are complete, accurate, current, or error-free.\nIn the event of any pricing or specification error, we have the right to refuse or cancel your order in our sole discretion.\nIf we cancel your order for an automatically renewing Creative Tool, you will not be charged for that Creative Tool after the date of cancellation.\nRefunds for cancellations are addressed below.</p>\n<p>b.\nYour Right to Cancel.\nYou may cancel the Creative Tool any time after you submit your order.\nContact create-support@snap.com, or use any \u201ccancel\u201d functionality made available by Snap, to cancel or decline to renew the Creative Tool.\nIf you cancel the Creative Tool, you may be eligible for a full or partial refund, as described in these Terms.</p>\n<p>c.\nRefunds.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(i) In-App Submissions: Refunds for in-app submissions are controlled by your in-app purchasing provider.\nPlease contact your in-app purchasing provider for details.</p>\n<p>(ii) Other Submissions: If you or we cancel the Creative Tool before it runs on the Services, you\u2019ll receive a full refund of payments you already made for that Creative Tool.\nOther than for automatically renewing Creative Tools, if you or we cancel the Creative Tool while it\u2019s running, we may provide a partial refund so that you\u2019ll only pay for the time the Creative Tool ran.\nRefunds for cancellations of automatically renewing Creative Tool are governed by the additional terms you agreed to at the time of submission.\nFor all refunds by Snap to payment cards, please allow 3-5 business days for the funds to appear in your account.</p>\n<p>You agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order, your sole and exclusive remedy is either: (1) we\u2019ll issue a credit to the payment method used for that order in an amount equal to the cancelled portion of the order.\nor (2) we won\u2019t charge you for the cancelled portion of the order.\nAs stated above, you\u2019ll be responsible for, and your payment method may be charged for, all fees associated with orders already processed before your cancellation was received.</p>\n<p>d.\nSurvival of Terms.\nThe Introduction and Sections 2, 6-8, 12-13, and 15-18 of these Terms will survive the termination of these Terms and the expiration of the licenses granted in these Terms.</p> 9.\nDelivery of the Creative Tool <p>If we accept your order we will make the Creative Tool available as requested by you in your submission, unless we cannot do so for reasons outside of our control or for other reasons as described in these Terms.\nWe do not guarantee perfect delivery, and we do not guarantee that any Snapchat users will choose to use the Creative Tool.</p>\n<p>After you submit the Asset, Snap may provide you a scannable code (\u201cSnapcode\u201d).\nYour use of that Snapcode must be in compliance with the Snapchat Brand Guidelines and Snapcode Usage Guidelines.\nSnapchat users may be given the option to access the Creative Tool by scanning the Snapcode or through other means provided by Snap (each, an \u201cUnlock\u201d).\nAny Snapchat user may Unlock the Creative Tool.\nSnap reserves the right to deactivate the Unlock and redirect the Unlock, each at Snap\u2019s sole discretion.</p> 10.\nBusiness Creative Tools and Advertising <p>Before you submit the Asset, Snap may ask you whether the Creative Tool is personal or for a business.\nClick \u201cbusiness\u201d (a) if you\u2019re submitting the Asset on behalf of a business.\n(b) if the Asset includes any branding, logos, or business marks or names.\nor (c) if the Asset promotes a business or brand.\nWe refer to Creative Tools that include these types of Assets as \u201cBusiness Custom Creative Tools.\u201d We refer to other Creative Tools as \u201cPersonal Custom Creative Tools.\u201d You agree that you will not use any branding, logos, or business marks or names, or promote a business or brand, in any Personal Custom Creative Tool.\nWhen submitting an Asset for a Business Custom Creative Tool, you agree to include the accurate business name.</p>\n<p>We may in our sole discretion apply a label or disclosure to notify Snapchat users that the Creative Tool is a purchased product.\nFor example, the word \u201csponsored\u201d or a similar word or phrase may appear on the Creative Tool when users first see it.\nThat\u2019s one reason it\u2019s very important that you click \u201cbusiness\u201d if the Creative Tool in fact promotes a business or brand.\nWe may in our sole discretion include in that label or disclosure the name you provided in the purchase tool.\nYou, not we, are responsible for including any legally required advertising disclosure in the Creative Tool.</p>\n<p>Snap or its affiliates may, without compensation to you or others, serve or otherwise place ads near the Creative Tools.\nFor example, Snapchat users swiping to see Snapchat\u2019s creative tool offerings may see a branded or sponsored Creative Tool before or after the Creative Tool you\u2019ve submitted, or a Snapchat user may apply the Creative Tool to their content and that content may include or be followed or preceded by an ad or other branded or sponsored content within the Services.</p> 11.\nPromotions <p>If you use the Creative Tool or any part of the Services as part of a sweepstakes, contest, offer, or other promotion (each, a \u201cPromotion\u201d), you are solely responsible for complying with all laws wherever your Promotion is offered, as well as with our Promotions Rules.\nUnless we expressly agree otherwise in writing, Snap will not be a sponsor or an administrator of your Promotion.</p> 12.\nYour Representations and Warranties <p>In addition to your representations and warranties under the Snap Inc.\nTerms of Service, you represent and warrant that (a) you have all rights and any necessary consents to license the Asset and any Additional Elements incorporated into the Asset, and to grant any waivers in connection with the Asset and any Additional Elements incorporated into the Asset, to Snap and its affiliates.\n(b) the Asset does not violate these Terms or our Community Guidelines, Advertising Policies, or Custom Creative Tools Submission Guidelines.\n(c) the Asset does not, and its use in connection with the Services will not, violate, misappropriate, or infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, privacy, or publicity rights, or any other rights of any person or entity.\n(d) you have not assigned, licensed, or otherwise encumbered the Asset to any other person or entity.\n(e) the Asset complies with all laws, rules, and regulations and is suitable for audiences ages 13 and up (or the ages you\u2019ve age-targeted via the purchase tool, if applicable).\n(f) the Asset does not, and will not, defame, bully, cause injury or harm to, or inflict emotional distress on, any third party.\n(g) any and all information you have provided to Snap in connection with the Asset and your submission is accurate and correct.\nand (h) you will not use any payment card or other form of payment to submit an order for Snap to run a Creative Tool unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so.\nIn the event Snap approves and uses the Asset, such approval and use will not diminish or waive your representations and warranties contained in these Terms.</p>\n<p>You further represent and warrant that (a) neither you, nor, if you are a business, any affiliated company, are included on any of the restricted party lists maintained by the U.S.\nGovernment -- including the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List administered by the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and the Denied Parties List, Unverified List, and Entity List maintained by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of

resident in, located in, or organized under the laws of any country with which trade is prohibited by OFAC or other applicable sanctions.</p>\n<p>If you are using the Services on behalf of a business, you further represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the business with the authority to bind the business to these Terms and agree on behalf of the business to be bound by these Terms.</p> 13.\nYour Indemnification to Us <p>In addition to your indemnification obligations under the Snap Inc.\nTerms of Service, you agree, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Snap, its affiliates, directors, officers, stockholders, employees, licensors, and agents from and against any and all complaints, charges, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to (a) Snap\u2019s use and any third party\u2019s use of the Asset, including the Additional Elements, if any, in connection with the Services.\n(b) your use of the Services and your activities in connection with the Services.\n(c) your violation or alleged violation of any laws, rules, and regulations in connection with your use of the Services or your activities in connection with the Services.\n(d) any claim that the Asset infringes, violates, or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, design right, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy, or other right of any person or entity.\n(e) your use of products or services provided by a third party in connection with the Services, even if recommended or approved by Snap.\n(f) any fraud or misrepresentation by you.\nor (g) any violation or alleged violation of these Terms by you, including any actual or alleged breach of your representations, warranties, and obligations.</p> 14.\nNo Agency Relationship <p>Nothing in these Terms will be construed to imply a joint venture, principal-agent, or employment relationship between you and us or our affiliates.</p> 15.\nGoverning Law and Disputes Between You and Snap <p>These Terms are governed by the Choice of Law provision and Exclusive Venue

Creative Tool, the Arbitration provision of the Snap Inc.\nTerms of Service will apply, except that the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules will govern the arbitration instead of the AAA Consumer

Creative Tool on their Snaps.\nYou\u2019ll design the proposed Creative Tool and submit it as an image file for our review.\nSnap may allow you to edit or replace the image file after submission (the initial image file, and any edits or replacements, are collectively called the \u201cAsset\u201d).\nWe will notify you of any additional charges before you submit your revised or replacement

Creative Tool.</p> 2.\nYour License to Us <p>You grant Snap, Snap Inc., and their affiliates a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to communicate to the public, archive, copy, cache, encode, store, reproduce, record, sell, sublicense, distribute, transmit, broadcast, synchronize, adapt, edit, modify, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, republish, promote, exhibit, create derivative works based upon, and otherwise use the Asset on or in connection with the Services and the advertising, marketing, and promotion thereof, in all formats, on or through any means or media now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed.\nThis license includes the right for Snap, Snap Inc., and their affiliates to make the Asset available to Snapchat users, for sharing among Snapchat users, and for saving to their devices.\nThe license to make the Asset available to Snapchat users as a Creative Tool within the Services extends 90 days following the date when the Creative Tool run time on the Services ends, in order to allow us to deliver unopened Snaps that include the Creative Tool.\nFor Personal Custom Creative Tools, this license extends so long as the Creative Tool is available in Memories.\nThe license continues for the limited purposes of advertising, marketing, and promoting the Services.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that Snapchat users may be able to save, share, and view Snaps incorporating the Creative Tool during and beyond the Creative Tool\u2019s run time.\nYou acknowledge that Snapchat users may use the Asset for purposes or in ways other than you anticipated.\nYou agree that such uses constitute user-generated content for which neither Snap, Snap Inc., nor their affiliates bear any responsibility.\nYou agree that neither Snap, Snap Inc., nor their affiliates are liable for any claims or losses based on or arising from any user-generated content, including user-generated content that makes use of the Asset, whether within the Services or beyond.</p>\n<p>If you incorporate your or any third party\u2019s name, logo, trademark, likeness, image, visual work, music, sound effect, or other materials (collectively, \u201cAdditional Elements\u201d) into the Asset, you agree that this license includes all Additional Elements.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that Snap, Snap Inc., and their affiliates own all rights in the Creative Tool products and in any additional tools we may make available to you to create your Asset (such as

any use of the Asset.\nTo the extent permissible under law, you irrevocably waive\u2014or agree not to assert against Snap, Snap Inc., and their affiliates to the extent a waiver is not permitted\u2014any moral rights or equivalent rights you may have in the Asset throughout the world.\nYou agree that Snap may in our discretion resize, set the transparency of, and make other alterations to the Asset.</p>\n<p>If Snap makes the Asset available on the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Snap has the right (but no obligation) to publicly attribute the Asset to you, including by posting your name and city, state, and country, as submitted by you or as tied to your Snapchat account.</p> 3.\nAsset Content Restrictions <p>The Asset must comply with our Custom Creative Tools Submission Guidelines and our Community Guidelines and Advertising Policies.\nAnything prohibited as ad content by us is prohibited as a Creative Tool, and anything restricted as an ad is restricted as a Creative Tool.\nFor inquiries about buying a Creative Tool that includes a product listed in the restricted ads category, contact create-support@snap.com.</p>\n<p>Snap may provide you the option to age-target the Creative Tool.\nThis means we may make the Creative Tool available only to those Snapchat users who we reasonably believe fall within the age range you select in the purchase tool.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Snapchat users who apply age-targeted Creative Tools to their Snaps will be able to send those Snaps to other Snapchat users without age restriction.\nIf the content of the Creative Tool requires age-targeting by law, rule, regulation, or industry standards in the region where the Creative Tool will run, you are responsible for selecting the correct age in the purchase tool, and we will not be liable if you fail to do so.\nIf a required age-targeting option is not available, do not submit your order.</p> 4.\nOrders, Pricing, and Availability <p>a.\nOrders.\nWe\u2019ll indicate in the purchase tool the first date when the Creative Tool could start to run.</p>\n<p>We may offer you the option to have the Creative Tool run on an automatically renewing basis, with recurring billing as indicated in the purchase tool.\nIf you select this option, the Creative Tool may run until cancelled or you decline to renew the Creative Tool.</p>\n<p>b.\nPricing.\nWe price Creative Tools in our discretion based on a number of factors, including how long and over how large an area you want the Creative Tool to run.\nYou can see the price adjust as you manipulate the size, location, and run time for the Creative Tool in the purchase tool.\nWe may also offer an option that lets you more generally select a location and time to run a Creative Tool, leaving it to us to define the geographic area, duration, and price.\nWe may change, suspend, or end any service, or modify prices prospectively, in our discretion.\nYou\u2019ll always see the final purchase price before you click to submit your order and enter into a contract with us.\nFor automatically renewing Creative Tool purchases, we will notify you in advance of any price changes that will take effect at the beginning of the next renewal period.\nTo the extent permitted by local law, you are deemed to accept the then-current price if you do not cancel the renewal in accordance with the cancellation policy then in effect.\nIf you do not wish to accept the renewal or the price change, you may cancel prior to the renewal going into effect.\nPlease be sure to carefully read any notifications we send regarding changes to price, these Terms, and any other offers.</p>\n<p>c.\nAvailability.\nSnap does not guarantee Creative Tool availability over all areas.\nKeep in mind that we may, and likely will, run multiple Creative Tools over any one location.\nWe reserve the right in our discretion to block certain areas without notice.\nPlease refer to Section 8 for information relating to refunds and cancellations.</p> 5.\nOur Review of the Proposed Creative Tool <p>When you submit your order, that doesn\u2019t mean the Creative Tool will be made available on the Services.\nSnap may reject a proposed Creative Tool if it violates the Asset Content Restrictions in Section 3, or for any other reason in our discretion.\nRefunds for rejected orders are described in Section 8.</p> 6.\nYour Purchase and Payment <p>a.\nPayment Methods.\nSnap accepts a variety of payment methods, as reflected in the purchase tool.\nBefore you can submit your order for Snap to run a Creative Tool, you may be required to provide a valid payment card number and associated information for a payment card that you are authorized to use, including any or all of the following: (i) your name as it appears on the card.\n(ii) the credit or debit card type.\n(iii) the card\u2019s expiration date.\n(iv) any activation numbers or codes needed to charge your card.\nand (v) the billing address or zip code or postal code associated with the card.\nYou authorize Snap and our payment processor, or your in-app purchasing provider, as applicable, to use information you submit to charge your card or other payment method for the price of the Creative Tool you submitted, in addition to any taxes, fees, and charges as described in these Terms at our convenience, including as early as at the time the order is submitted.\nIn the event the charge does not go through, you may be able to re-submit a payment method before the Creative Tool is scheduled to run.</p>\n<p>For automatically renewing Creative Tools, we\u2019ll charge your payment method before the renewal time unless the Creative Tool is cancelled or you decline to renew the Creative Tool.</p>\n<p>Your payment will be processed before the Creative Tool runs.\nIf you are paying by payment card, we or our third-party payment processor may run one or more payment card authorization checks on your card before then.\nYou authorize us or our third-party payment processor to store your payment card information and, if needed, to continue billing your card until the Creative Tool run time has expired to avoid interruptions in running the Creative Tool.</p>\n<p>If Snap does not receive payment from your payment card or other payment method issuer or their agent, you remain obligated and agree to pay all amounts due upon request from Snap or our agents.</p>\n<p>b.\nAccount Codes/Credits.\nSnap may on occasion provide a code, credit, coupon, or other form of discount in an amount and on terms and restrictions as provided by us.</p>\n<p>c.\nCost, Fees, and Taxes.\nPlease confirm that all details of your purchase are correct before submitting your order.\nWhen you submit your order, you agree to pay the cost of the Creative Tool (and, in the case of automatically renewing Creative Tools, the then-current price at the time of renewal unless the Creative Tool is cancelled or you decline to renew), plus any taxes, fees, and charges applicable to that order at the rates in effect when incurred, free of any withholding or deduction for taxes (\u201cCharges\u201d).\nFailure to pay the cost stated may result in termination or suspension of the Creative Tool.\nWe do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.</p>\n<p>If your Personal Custom Creative Tool order is subject to taxes (including value-added or goods and services taxes), Snap or your in-app purchasing provider, as applicable, will remit those taxes to the appropriate taxing authority.</p>\n<p>If your Business Custom Creative Tool order is subject to taxes (including value-added or goods and services taxes) and you are required by applicable law to remit and report those taxes, you agree to remit and report such taxes to the appropriate taxing authority.\nIf you are required to withhold or deduct any taxes, you will pay to Snap or your in-app purchasing provider, as applicable, any additional amount necessary so that Snap or your in-app purchasing provider, as applicable, receives a net amount equal to the Charges.\nYou will also provide Snap an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation supporting the withholding.</p>\n<p>Please see Section 19 for tax information specific to your country.</p>\n<p>d.\nOther Payment Terms.\nYour payment card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and your in-app purchasing provider\u2019s terms govern your use of in-app purchasing tools.\nYou must refer to your agreements with those third parties, and not these Terms, to determine the rights and liabilities as between you and those third parties.\nIf you have any payment-related issues with in-app submissions, please contact your in-app purchasing provider directly.\nIf you purchase with a payment card issued through a bank based outside the United States, your bank may charge you foreign transaction fees and other similar fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You are responsible for paying any unauthorized amounts billed to your payment method by a third party.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Except for an in-app submission, unless you notify us of any discrepancies within 60 days after they first appear on your payment card or other payment statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you.</p> 7.\nCommunications from Us <p>When you submit your order for Snap to run a Creative Tool, we\u2019ll send you an electronic notification using the contact information submitted by you, or tied to your Snapchat account, as applicable.\nThat confirmation does not mean we\u2019ve accepted your submission.\nWe may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order.</p>\n<p>We may send you other electronic notifications about the Creative Tool order, including about status, payment processing, refunds, price changes for automatically renewing Creative Tools, and any changes, updates, or cancellations to your order.\nTo the extent permitted by law, we may also send electronic notifications about the Creative Tool products or our other products or services.\n</p>\n<p>You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p> 8.\nCancellations and Refunds <p>a.\nOur Right to Cancel.\nSnap reserves the right to reject or cancel the Creative Tool at any time, including after the Creative Tool has started to run, because we\u2019ve blocked a certain area (see Section 4), because you or the Creative Tool violate our terms or guidelines or the law (see Sections 3 and 5), or because payment is not completed.\nMoreover, while we do our best to describe our products as accurately as possible, we do not warrant that specifications or pricing are complete, accurate, current, or error-free.\nIn the event of any pricing or specification error, we have the right to refuse or cancel your order in our sole discretion, subject to your right to a refund if applicable under Section 8(c) below.\nIf we cancel your order for an automatically renewing Creative Tool, you will not be charged for that Creative Tool after the date of cancellation.\nRefunds for cancellations are addressed below.</p>\n<p>b.\nYour Right to Cancel.\nYou may cancel the Creative Tool any time after you submit your order.\nContact create-support@snap.com, or use any \u201ccancel\u201d functionality made available by Snap, to cancel or decline to renew the Creative Tool.\nIf you cancel the Creative Tool, you may be eligible for a full or partial refund, as described in these Terms.</p>\n<p>c.\nRefunds.</p>\n<p>(i) In-App Submissions: Refunds for in-app submissions are controlled by your in-app purchasing provider.\nPlease contact your in-app purchasing provider for details.</p>\n<p>(ii) Other Submissions: If you or we cancel the Creative Tool before it runs on the Services, you\u2019ll receive a full refund of payments you already made for that Creative Tool.\nOther than for automatically renewing Creative Tools, if you or we cancel the Creative Tool while it\u2019s running, we may provide a partial refund so that you\u2019ll only pay for the time the Creative Tool ran.\nRefunds for cancellations of automatically renewing Creative Tool are governed by the additional terms you agreed to at the time of submission.\nFor all refunds by Snap to payment cards, please allow 3-5 business days for the funds to appear in your account.</p>\n<p>You agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order, you will be entitled to the following remedy, either: (1) we\u2019ll issue a credit to the payment method used for that order in an amount equal to the cancelled portion of the order.\nor (2) we won\u2019t charge you for the cancelled portion of the order.\nAs stated above, you\u2019ll be responsible for, and your payment method may be charged for, all fees associated with orders already processed before your cancellation was received.</p>\n<p>d.\nSurvival of Terms.\nThe Introduction and Sections 2, 6-8, 12-13, and 15-19 of these Terms will survive the termination of these Terms and the expiration of the licenses granted in these Terms.</p> 9.\nDelivery of the Creative Tool <p>If we accept your order we will make the Creative Tool available as requested by you in your submission, unless we cannot do so for reasons outside of our control or for other reasons as described in these Terms.\nWe do not guarantee perfect delivery, and we do not guarantee that any Snapchat users will choose to use the Creative Tool.\n</p>\n<p>After you submit the Asset, Snap may provide you a scannable code (\u201cSnapcode\u201d).\nYour use of that Snapcode must be in compliance with the Snapchat Brand Guidelines and Snapcode Usage Guidelines.\nSnapchat users may be given the option to access the Creative Tool by scanning the Snapcode or through other means provided by Snap (each, an \u201cUnlock\u201d).\nAny Snapchat user may Unlock the Creative Tool.\nSnap reserves the right to deactivate the Unlock and redirect the Unlock, each at Snap\u2019s sole discretion.</p> 10.\nBusiness Creative Tools and Advertising <p>Before you submit the Asset, Snap may ask you whether the Creative Tool is personal or for a business.\nClick \u201cbusiness\u201d (a) if you\u2019re submitting the Asset on behalf of a business.\n(b) if the Asset includes any branding, logos, or business marks or names.\nor (c) if the Asset promotes a business or brand.\nWe refer to Creative Tools that include these types of Assets as \u201cBusiness Custom Creative Tools.\u201d We refer to other Creative Tools as \u201cPersonal Custom Creative Tools.\u201d You agree that you will not use any branding, logos, or business marks or names, or promote a business or brand, in any Personal Custom Creative Tool.\nWhen submitting an Asset for a Business Custom Creative Tool, you agree to include the accurate business name.</p>\n<p>We

may appear on the Creative Tool when users first see it.\nThat\u2019s one reason it\u2019s very important that you click \u201cbusiness\u201d if the Creative Tool in fact promotes a business or brand.\nWe may in our sole discretion include in that label or disclosure the name you provided in the purchase tool.\nYou, not we, are responsible for including any legally required advertising disclosure in the Creative Tool.</p>\n<p>Snap, Snap Inc., or their affiliates may, without compensation to you or others, serve or otherwise place ads near the Creative Tools.\nFor example, Snapchat users swiping to see Snapchat\u2019s creative tool offerings may see a branded or sponsored Creative Tool before or after the Creative Tool you\u2019ve submitted, or a Snapchat user may apply the Creative Tool to their content and that content may include or be followed or preceded by an ad or other branded or sponsored content within the Services.</p> 11.\nPromotions <p>If you use the Creative Tool or any part of the Services as part of a sweepstakes, contest, offer, or other promotion (each, a \u201cPromotion\u201d), you are solely responsible for complying with all laws wherever

priority.\nWe know your trust is earned every time you use Snapchat, or any of our other products \u2014 that\u2019s why we treat your information differently than most other tech companies.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t stockpile your private messages and we don\u2019t publicly showcase a timeline of everything you\u2019ve ever posted.\nSnapchat\u2019s designed so that people can only see the things you want to share, for as long as you want to share them.\nWe believe this makes Snapchat feel less like a permanent record and more like a conversation with friends.</p>\n<p>Even though our products are constantly evolving, our privacy principles remain unchanged:</p>We communicate honestly and openly<p>When you use Snap products, you share information with us \u2014 it\u2019s our responsibility to help you understand how that information is used.\nOur Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information \u2014 you can read the highlights here.\nIf you\u2019re curious about how a certain feature uses your data, Privacy by Product breaks things down a bit more.\nWe also explain how features use data right inside of our apps, and throughout our Support Center.\nOf course, if you still can\u2019t find what you need, you can always ask!</p>You choose how to express yourself<p>We believe that privacy is essential to empowering self-expression.\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019re in control of who you share things with, how you share them, and how long they can be seen.\nYou decide who can see your Story, which friends can see your Bitmoji on the Snap Map, and just how long your Snaps stick around.\nYou can keep things just between you and a friend, or share a moment with the whole world! Learn more.</p>We design with privacy in mind<p>New features go through an intense privacy review process \u2014 we talk about things, we debate them, and we work hard to build products we\u2019re proud of and that we\u2019ll want to use.\nAfter all, we use these products every day, both at work and in our personal lives.\nWe handle your information with the same care that we use for ourselves, our company, our family, and our friends.</p>You control your information<p>You have the right to control your information.\nThat\u2019s why we provide easy ways to access and update your information, adjust how much information you share with us, and request that we delete your information \u2014 or your account, altogether.\nYou can control most of your privacy settings right in our mobile applications.\nYou can even log in and download your Snapchat information here.\nIf you ever have any specific questions about your data, don\u2019t hesitate to contact us!</p>Deletion is our default<p>Snapchat aims to capture the feeling of hanging out with friends in person \u2014 that\u2019s why Snaps and Chats are deleted from our servers once they\u2019re opened or expired.\nAfter a Snap is deleted, we\u2019ll mainly be able to see the basic details \u2014 like when it was sent and who it was sent to.\nLearn more.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to keep in mind that other Snapchatters can always take a screenshot, or save things using a third-party app.\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s best to only share the need-to-know stuff with the people you really trust \u2014 just like you would in real life!</p>Happy Snapping!\u00a9 2020 Snap Inc.<ul>\n<li>CitizenSnap</li>\n<li>Privacy Policy</li>\n<li>Terms of Service</li>\n<li>Other Terms

done our best below, and in our Terms of Service, to set out specific rules of the road for what content we allow on Snapchat.\nBut it's hard to anticipate every situation that might come up.\nThe key

"//*[@class='textarticle-container privacy-policy']", "text": "Privacy Policy <p>Effective: September 14, 2020</p>\n<p>Snap Inc.\nis a camera company.\nOur products and services\u2014including Snapchat, Bitmoji, Spectacles, advertising, and others that link to this Privacy Policy\u2014provide fast and fun ways to express yourself, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together!</p>\n<p>When you use these services, you\u2019ll share some information with us.\nSo we want to be upfront about the information we collect, how we use it, whom we share it with, and the controls we give you to access, update, and delete your information.\n</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019ve written this Privacy Policy.\nAnd it\u2019s why we\u2019ve tried to write it in a way that\u2019s blissfully free of the legalese that often clouds these documents.\nOf course, if you still have questions about anything in our Privacy Policy, just contact us.</p>\n<p>You should read our entire Privacy Policy, but when you only have a few minutes or want to remember something later on, you can always take a look at this summary\u2014so you can review some of the basics in just a few minutes.</p> Information We Collect <p>There are three basic categories of information we collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Information you provide.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information we get when you use our services.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information we get from third parties.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s a little more detail on each of these categories.</p> Information You Provide <p>When you interact with our services, we collect information that you provide to us.\nFor example, most of our services require you to set up a Snapchat account, so we need to collect a few important details about you, such as your name, username, password, email address, phone number, and date of birth.\nWe may also ask you to provide us with some additional information that will be publicly visible on our services, such as a profile picture or Bitmoji avatar.\nOther services, such as commerce products, may require you to provide us with a debit or credit card number and its associated account information.</p>\n<p>Of course, you\u2019ll also provide us whatever information you send through our services, such as Snaps and Chats.\nKeep in mind that the users who view your Snaps, Chats, and any other content can always save that content or copy it outside the app.\nSo, the same common sense that applies to the internet at large applies to Snapchat as well: Don\u2019t send messages or share content that you wouldn\u2019t want someone to save or share.</p>\n<p>When you contact customer support or communicate with us in any other way, we\u2019ll collect whatever information you volunteer or that we need to resolve your question.</p> Information We Get When You Use Our Services <p>When you use our services, we collect information about which of those services you\u2019ve used and how you\u2019ve used them.\nWe might know, for instance, that you watched a particular Story, saw a specific ad for a certain period of time, and sent a few Snaps.\nHere\u2019s a fuller explanation of the types of information we collect when you use our services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your activity through our services.\nFor example, we may collect information about: <ul>\n<li>how you interact with our services, such as which filters you view or apply to Snaps, which Stories you watch on Discover, whether you\u2019re using Spectacles, or which search queries you submit.</li>\n<li>how you communicate with other Snapchatters, such as their names, the time and date of your communications, the number of messages you exchange with your friends, which friends you exchange messages with the most, and your interactions with messages (such as when you open a message or capture a screenshot).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content Information.</strong> We collect content you create on our services, such as custom stickers, and information about the content you create or provide, such as if the recipient has viewed the content and the metadata that is provided with the content.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information from and about the devices you use.\nFor example, we collect: <ul>\n<li>information about your hardware and software, such as the hardware model, operating system version, device memory, advertising identifiers, unique application identifiers, apps installed, unique device identifiers, browser type, language, battery level, and time zone;</li>\n<li>information from device sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, compasses, microphones, and whether you have headphones connected.\nand</li>\n<li>information about your wireless and mobile network connections, such as mobile phone number, service provider, IP address, and signal strength.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Device Phonebook.</strong> Because Snapchat is all about communicating with friends, we may\u2014with your permission\u2014collect information from your device\u2019s phonebook.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Camera and Photos.</strong> Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device\u2019s camera and photos.\nFor example, you won\u2019t be able to send Snaps or upload photos from your camera roll unless we can access your camera or photos.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location Information.</strong> When you use our services we may collect information about your location.\nWith your permission, we may also collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.</strong> Like most online services and mobile applications, we may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers, to collect information about your activity, browser, and device.\nWe may also use these technologies to collect information when you interact with services we offer through one of our partners, such as advertising and commerce features.\nFor example, we may use information collected on other websites to show you more relevant ads.\nMost web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.\nIf you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser cookies through the settings on your browser or device.\nKeep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our services.\nTo learn more about how we and our partners use cookies on our services and your choices, please check out our Cookie Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Log Information.</strong> We also collect log information when you use our website, such as: <ul>\n<li>details about how you\u2019ve used our services;</li>\n<li>device information, such as your web browser type and language;</li>\n<li>access times;</li>\n<li>pages viewed;</li>\n<li>IP address;</li>\n<li>identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser.\nand</li>\n<li>pages you visited before or after navigating to our website.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> Information We Collect from Third Parties <p>We may collect information about you from other users, our affiliates, and third parties.\nHere are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you link your Snapchat account to another service (like Bitmoji or a third-party app), we may receive information from the other service, like how you use that service.</li>\n<li>Advertisers, app developers, publishers, and other third parties may share information with us as well.\nWe may use this information, among other ways, to help target or measure the performance of ads.\nYou can learn more about our use of this kind of third-party data in our Support Center.</li>\n<li>If another user uploads their contact list, we may combine information from that user\u2019s contact list with other information we have collected about you.</li>\n</ul> How We Use Information <p>What do we do with the information we collect? For the detailed answer, go here.\nThe short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve.\nHere are the ways we do that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>develop, operate, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services.</li>\n<li>send you communications, including by email.\nFor example, we may use email to respond to support inquiries or to share information about our products, services, and promotional offers that we think may interest you.\n</li>\n<li>monitor and analyze trends and usage.</li>\n<li>personalize our services by, among other things, suggesting friends, profile information, or Bitmoji stickers, or customizing the content we show you, including ads.</li>\n<li>contextualize your experience by, among other things, tagging your Memories content using your precise location information (if, of course, you\u2019ve given us permission to collect that information) and applying other labels based on the content.</li>\n<li>provide and improve our advertising services, ad targeting, and ad measurement, including through the use of your precise location information (again, if you\u2019ve given us permission to collect that information), both on and off our services.\nSee the Control Over Your Information section below for more information about Snap Inc.\u2019s advertising practices and your choices.</li>\n<li>enhance the safety and security of our products and services.</li>\n<li>verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity.</li>\n<li>use information we\u2019ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance our services and your experience with them.</li>\n<li>enforce our Terms of Service and other usage policies and comply with legal requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also use information from Apple\u2019s TrueDepth camera to improve the quality of Lenses.\nInformation from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time\u2014we don\u2019t store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.</p> How We Share Information <p>We may share information about you in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>With other Snapchatters.</strong> We may share the following information with other Snapchatters: <ul>\n<li>information about you, such as your username, name, and Bitmoji.</li>\n<li>information about how you have interacted with our services, such as your Snapchat \u201cscore,\u201d the names of Snapchatters you are friends with, and other information that will help Snapchatters understand your connections with others using our services.\nFor example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Snapchat friends in common.</li>\n<li>any additional information you have directed us to share.\nFor example, Snap will share your information when you connect your Snapchat account to a third-party app, and if you share information or content from Snapchat to the third-party app.</li>\n<li>content you post or send.\nHow widely your content is shared depends on your personal settings and the type of service you are using.\nFor example, a Snap may be sent to just a single friend you select, but your My Story content may be seen by any Snapchatter whom you allow to see your My Story.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With all Snapchatters, our business partners, and the general public.</strong> We may share the following information with all Snapchatters as well as with our business partners and the general public: <ul>\n<li>public information like your name, username, Snapcode and profile pictures.</li>\n<li>Story submissions that are set to be viewable by Everyone and any content that you submit to an inherently public service, like Our Story and other crowd-sourced services.\nThis content may be viewed and shared by the public at large both on and off our services, including through search results, on websites, in apps, and in online and offline broadcasts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With our affiliates.</strong> We may share information with entities within the Snap Inc.\nfamily of companies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With third parties.</strong> We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, including to measure and optimize the performance of ads and deliver more relevant ads, including on third-party websites and apps.\nLearn more here.\n<ul>\n<li>We may share information about you with business partners that provide services and functionality on our services.\nFor more information about information collected by third parties on our services, visit our Support Site.</li>\n<li>We may share information about you, such as device and usage information, to help us and others prevent fraud.</li>\n<li>We may share information about you for legal, safety, and security reasons.\nWe may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to: <ul>\n<li>comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation.</li>\n<li>investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations.</li>\n<li>protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others.</li>\n<li>detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We may share information about you as part of a merger or acquisition.\nIf Snap Inc.\ngets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, liquidation or bankruptcy, or acquisition of all or some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also share with third parties that provide services to us or perform business purposes for us aggregated, non-personally identifiable, or de-identified information.</p> Third-Party Content and Integrations <p>Our services may contain third-party content and integrations.\nExamples include third-party integrations in camera search, third-party games in Chat, and third-party Snap Kit integrations.\nThrough these integrations, you may be providing information to the third party as well as to Snap.\nWe are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information.\nAs always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.\nYou can learn more about third-party services in Snapchat here.</p> How Long We Keep Your Information <p>Snapchat lets you capture what it\u2019s like to live in the moment.\nOn our end, that means most messages\u2014like Snaps and Chats\u2014sent in Snapchat will be automatically deleted by default from our servers after we detect they\u2019ve been opened by all recipients or have expired.\nOther content, like Story posts, are stored for longer.\nFor detailed information about how long we store different types of content, check out our Support Site.</p>\n<p>We store other information for longer periods of time.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We store your basic account information\u2014like your name, phone number, and email address\u2014and list of friends until you ask us to delete them.</li>\n<li>We store location information for different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which services you use.\nFor example, if you use the Map, we store information about your favorite places for up to 40 days so we can personalize and improve your experience.\nIf location information is associated with a Snap\u2014like those saved to Memories or posted to Our Story\u2014we\u2019ll retain that location as long as we store the Snap.</li>\n<li>We\u2019re constantly collecting and updating information about the things you might like and dislike, so we can provide you with more relevant content and advertisements.\nGo here to learn more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you ever decide to stop using Snapchat, you can just ask us to delete your account.\nWe\u2019ll also delete most of the information we\u2019ve collected about you after you\u2019ve been inactive for a while\u2014but don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll try to contact you first!</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion practices automatically, we cannot promise that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe.\nThere may be legal requirements to store your data and we may need to suspend those deletion practices if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve content, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your account or content created by you is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations.\nFinally, we may also retain certain information in backup for a limited period of time or as required by law.</p> Control Over Your Information <p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Access, Correction, and Portability.</strong> You can access and edit most of your basic account information right in our apps.\nYou can also use Download My Data to obtain a copy of information that isn\u2019t available in our apps in a portable format, so you can move it or store it wherever you want.\nBecause your privacy is important to us, we will ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information.\nWe may also reject your request to access or update your personal information for a number of reasons, including, for example, if the request risks the privacy of other users or is unlawful.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Revoking permissions.</strong> In most cases, if you let us use your information, you can simply revoke your permission by changing the settings in the app or on your device if your device offers those options.\nOf course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deletion.</strong> While we hope you\u2019ll remain a lifelong Snapchatter, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, just go here to learn how.\nYou can also delete some information in the app, like photos you\u2019ve saved to Memories, Our Story submissions, and search history.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising Preferences.</strong> We try to show you ads that we think will be relevant to your interests.\nIf you would like to modify the information we and our advertising partners use to select these ads, you can do so in the app and through your device preferences.\nGo here to learn more.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communicating with other Snapchatters.</strong> It\u2019s important to us that you stay in control over whom you communicate with.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve built a number of tools in Settings that let you indicate, among other things, who you want to see your Stories, whether you\u2019d like to receive Snaps from just your friends or all Snapchatters, and whether you\u2019d like to block another Snapchatter from contacting you again.\nGo here to learn more.\n</li>\n</ul> Users in the European Union <p>If you\u2019re a user in the European Union, you should know that Snap Inc.\nis the controller of your personal information.\nHere is some additional information we would like to bring to your attention:</p> Rights of Access, Deletion, Correction, and Portability <p>You can exercise your rights of access, deletion, correction, and portability as described in the Control Over Your Information section above.</p> Bases for Using Your Information <p>Your country only allows us to use your personal information when certain conditions apply.\nThese conditions are called \u201clegal bases\u201d and, at Snap, we typically rely on one of four:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Contract.</strong> One reason we might use your information is because you\u2019ve entered into an agreement with us.\nFor example, when you buy an On-Demand Geofilter and accepted our Custom Creative Tools Terms, we need to use some of your information to collect payment and make sure we show your Geofilter to the right people at the right place and time.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legitimate interest.</strong> Another reason we might use your information is because we have\u2014or a third party has\u2014a legitimate interest in doing so.\nFor example, we need to use your information to provide and improve our services, including protecting your account, delivering your Snaps, providing customer support, and helping you find friends and content we think you\u2019ll like.\nBecause most of our services are free, we also use some information about you to try and show you ads you\u2019ll find interesting.\nAn important point to understand about legitimate interest is that our interests don\u2019t outweigh your right to privacy, so we only rely on legitimate interest when we think the way we are using your data doesn\u2019t significantly impact your privacy or would be expected by you, or there is a compelling reason to do so.\nWe explain our legitimate business reasons for using your information in more detail here.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent.</strong> In some cases we\u2019ll ask for consent to use your information for specific purposes.\nIf we do, we\u2019ll make sure you can revoke your consent in our services or through your device permissions.\nEven if we\u2019re not relying on consent to use your information, we may ask you for permission to access data like contacts and location.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal obligation.</strong> We may be required to use your personal information to comply with the law, like when we respond to valid legal process or need to take action to protect our users.\nOur policy is to notify Snapchatters when we receive legal process seeking their account information, with some exceptions.\nLearn more here.</li>\n</ul> Your Right to Object <p>You have the right to object to our use of your information.\nWith many types of data, we\u2019ve provided you with the ability to simply delete it if you don\u2019t want us processing it anymore.\nFor other types of data, we\u2019ve given you the ability to stop the use of your data by disabling the feature altogether.\nYou can do these things in the app.\nIf there are other types of information you don\u2019t agree with us processing, you can contact us.</p> International Transfers <p>We may collect your personal information from, transfer it to, and store and process it in the United States and other countries outside of where you live.\nWhenever we share information of EU users outside the EU we make sure an adequate transfer mechanism is in place.\nYou can find more information on the categories of third parties we share information with here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Complaints?</strong> If you\u2019re based in the EU, you can always file a complaint with the supervisory authority in your Member State.</p> Users in Brazil <p>If you\u2019re a user in Brazil you should know that Snap Inc.\nis the controller of your personal information.\nHere is some additional information we would like to bring to your attention:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Rights of Access, Deletion, Correction, and Portability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can exercise your rights of access,
