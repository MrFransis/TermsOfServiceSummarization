sector-specific privacy laws, such as the HIPAA, the FCRA, GLBA or the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994.\nThis section does not apply to information relating to our employees, contractors, applicants and other personnel.</p>\n<p>7.2 Collection and use of Personal Information.\nFor more details about the personal information we have collected over the last 12 months, including the

information), to delete their personal information, to opt out of any \u201csales\u201d that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.</p>\n<p>7.4 Disclosure of Personal Information.\nWe share personal information with the categories of third parties described in the Recipients Of Your Personal Information section above.\nWe do not \u201csell\u201d personal information as most people would typically understand that term.\nHowever, we do allow certain third-party partners and providers to collect information about consumers directly through our services for purposes of analyzing and optimizing our services, delivering ads, providing content and ads that are more relevant, measuring statistics and the success of ad campaigns, and detecting and reporting fraud.\nTo the extent this practice is interpreted to constitute a \u201csale\u201d under the CCPA, please see our Cookies And Similar Technologies and Interest Based Advertising section below for more information including how to exercise your rights to opt-out of cookies, analytics and personalized advertising.</p>\n<p>7.5 California consumers may make a request pursuant to their

able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.</p>\n<p>7.7 To Submit Your California Consumer Rights Requests.\nYou may submit a request to exercise your California Consumer Rights through one of the mechanisms described below.\nWe will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional personal

respond to web browser \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) signals.\nBecause there currently isn't an industry or legal standard to recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them at this time.\nWe await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.\nTo find out more about \u201cDo Not Track,\u201d please
