unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, while considering the risks involved.\nincluding, but not limited to, severity of foreseeable harm and likelihood that our processing could threaten the individual rights and freedoms of the Candidates.\nWhile no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to

such access.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although we do our best to protect the personal information of our Customers and Candidates, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information transmitted to the Site
