relationship between you and test IO GmbH (hereinafter: \u201ctest IO\u201d).<br>\n<br>1.\ntest IO GmbH (hereinafter \u201ctest IO\u201d) provides contractors the opportunity to work as \u201ctesters\u201d.\nIn concrete terms, this means that test IO gives testers the technical means to register on a website as testers by creating a login (\u201caccount\u201d), so that they can process end customer jobs (\u201ctest runs\u201d) independently.\nAs such, testers can decide for themselves when, where, and how often they complete jobs for test IO.\nTesters are compensated for their work according to the compensation table applicable to that particular test run.\nTesters are independent contractors and are not employees or agents of test IO.<br>\n<br>1.1 These terms and conditions regulate the framework conditions for testers\u2019 work for test IO.\nAcceptance of a tester\u2019s offer to perform a test run constitutes an individual contractual relationship governed by the conditions specified at the time of job assignment and accepted by the tester.\nIn submitting an offer to perform a test run, the tester pledges to conduct the research and work relevant to that job carefully, conscientiously, and in accordance with the principles of test IO.<br>\n<br>2.\nThese terms and conditions are applicable to all contractual relationships between test IO and testers.\nIt replaces all previous agreements, effective as of the moment at which these terms and conditions are accepted.\nThe tester\u2019s own terms and conditions do not apply regardless of whether test IO expressly objects to them or not.<br>\n<br>2.1 test IO reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions at any time.\nAt the time of his or her next login, the tester will be notified of the change and provided the new terms and conditions in a save- and print-ready format.\nThe tester may then accept the new terms and conditions, and confirms having understood and accepted the terms by clicking the confirmation field.<br>\n<br>2.2 Side agreements made orally have no legal validity.\nAny changes to these terms and conditions must be made in writing, including but not limited to emails, faxes, or texts posted online and made available for the recipient to save and print.\nThis also applies to agreements setting aside the written-form requirement.<br>\n<br>2.3 In order to be able to work as testers, users must go through a one-time process of setting up a free user account and having that account activated by test IO.\nTesters must be at least eighteen years old to set up a user account.\ntest IO is not legally obligated to activate user accounts.\nTesters are under no obligation to provide any services and can close their accounts at any time.<br>\n<br>3.\nWhen setting up user accounts, testers are obligated to provide the requested information completely, correctly, and in the appropriate format.\nIn individual cases, test IO reserves the right to make account activation contingent upon the provision of suitable proof demonstrating the accuracy of the information given.\nTesters are obligated to keep this user information up-to-date, and to use the editing function to make any necessary changes without delay.\nShould test IO be unable to contact the tester as a result of the tester\u2019s failure to update this information as necessary, test IO accepts no liability for the situation.\nThe tester is obligated to compensate test IO for any damages it incurs as a result of the tester having provided false, inaccurate, or incomplete data.<br>\n<br>3.1 Users are to select a user name and a password of their choice when setting up an account.\nSelected user names must not violate any rights, especially third party naming or trademark rights, and must not violate common decency.\nPasswords have to be kept secret and shall not be disclosed to any third party.\n<br>\n<br>3.2 Generally speaking, registering user accounts for third parties is not permitted.\nTesters are also forbidden from maintaining multiple user accounts.<br>\n<br>3.3 test IO will conduct an anti-money laundering, sanctions and terrorist watch list screening of the testers in relation to restrictions and sanctions to satisfy test IO\u2019s own compliance with applicable law.\nFor this purpose test IO will check the testers information against official lists or use third parties to do so.\n(\u201cScreening\u201d)<br>\n<br>3.4 test IO reserves the right to delete a tester\u2019s user account and/or terminate its contractual relationship with the tester if the tester violates these terms and conditions or any other obligations arising from this contractual relationship or if the Screening as stated above will not be passed.\nIn such cases, the tester will receive payment for any accepted work he or she has already performed for test IO.\nTesters may have their accounts deleted at any time by sending an email to support@test.io.\nInformation and data subject to compulsory record retention regulations (e.g., invoices/credit vouchers) will only be deleted following expiry of the relevant retention period.\nAll other data will be deleted at the time of the account\u2019s deletion.<br>\n<br>3.5 Accounts will only be activated for job processing after the tester successfully performs an unremunerated warm-up test run.\nThe tester will receive an invitation to the warm-up test run once he or she has successfully registered as per the specifications listed above.\nTesters have no legal claim to invitations to warm-up test runs.<br>\n<br>3.6 Once a tester has registered an account and test IO has activated that account, test IO may contact the tester under the email he or she has provided in order to solicit an offer for the performance of a concrete test run.\nThis constitutes only an \u201cinvitation to bid\u201d (invitatio ad offerendum).\nTesters can use the reply function to send test IO a quote for the performance of the test run under the conditions specified in the project description.\ntest IO is under no obligation to accept these quotes.\nas such, test IO\u2019s inquiry does not represent a legally binding offer.<br>\n<br>3.7 Should test IO accept the tester\u2019s quote for performance of a test run, the information required to perform the test run will be made available to the tester shortly before the test run is activated.\nThe tester\u2019s acceptance of a test run does not give test IO any legal right to have the tester work through the test run as per the conditions specified.\nConversely, test IO is under no obligation to accept the tester\u2019s work if it is not done in accordance with the conditions and requirements indicated in the project description, and if the tester\u2019s work qualifies as misperformance.\nIn particular, work will no longer be accepted once test IO\u2019s previously specified deadline for service performance has passed.<br>\n<br>3.8 The tester shall be paid for each error he or she discovers while performing the test run.\nTesters report each discovered error using the form provided by test IO.\nThe tester lists a description of the error on the form and assigns the error to one of three categories: Low, High, or Critical.\nThis assessment is only for purposes of initial orientation.\nit is not binding for the tester\u2019s claim to compensation.\ntest IO will then check the error.\nThe tester shall not receive compensation for the error if:<br>\n<br>1.\nsequential error log numbering makes it evident to test IO that the report is a duplicate, and that the error has previously been discovered by another tester, or <br>\n<br>2.\nthe error cannot be reproduced by test IO, and is thus not demonstrably present.<br>\n<br>3.\ntest IO will also check the tester\u2019s labeling of the error as Category Low, High or Critical, and change this assignation if necessary.\nAs per \u00a7 317 of the German Commercial Code, test IO\u2019s end customer is responsible for making final determinations regarding error categories.<br>\n<br>4.\nFor certain test runs, the tester shall receive lump sum compensation for completing one or more jobs defined by test IO, either in addition to or instead of compensation per error discovered.\nSuch compensation may be provided for jobs such as (for example) research tasks, answering questionnaires, or working through so-called test cases.<br>\n<br>4.\nTesters shall be specially informed as to the exact rate of compensation per error discovered (as per Section 1) or per job (as per Section 3.8 (4)) for each job.\nWhen test IO sends the tester an email requesting that the tester submit a quote for test run performance, the email will specify a concrete amount of compensation per error discovered during the test run/per job.\nthe tester shall then apply this compensation rate when submitting his or her offer.<br>\n<br>1.\nJob orders for performance of test runs are assigned exclusively to the tester who submitted the corresponding offer.\nJob orders may only be forwarded to third parties with test IO\u2019s express written permission.\n<br>\n<br>2.\nThe tester is responsible for all taxes (including income tax and social security contributions) on revenues he or she earns through test IO, wherever in the world the obligation to pay such taxes arises.<br>\n<br>5.\nCopyright or other intellectual property rights-protected deliverables resulting from the tester\u2019s work remain the exclusive property of test IO.\nIn particular, test IO retains the rights to reproduce, distribute, lease, edit or restructure the deliverables.\nthe rights to show the deliverables in public or make them publicly

designations, without obtaining the tester\u2019s permission.\nThe tester is obligated to release the deliverables resulting from his or her work activities and make them available to test IO at any time upon test IO\u2019s request.<br>\n<br>1.\ntest IO also retains rights to all currently unknown forms of usage (see \u00a7 31a of the German Copyright Act).<br>\n<br>2.\nUnder no circumstances shall the tester commercialize, nor allow others to commercialize, deliverables created in the course of their work as per Section 5.1.<br>\n<br>3.\nInsofar as the tester creates a program as defined under \u00a7 69a Section 1 of the German Copyright Act in fulfillment of his or her contractual relationship with test IO, or in accordance with the written job specifications provided by test IO, the rights are transferred as described under \u00a7 69b of the German Copyright Act.\nThe rights are transferred at the time the deliverables are created.<br>\n<br>4.\nTo the extent the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of deliverables cannot be transferred to test IO the tester shall grant to test IO an irrevocable, exclusive right of use and exploitation for all known types of use which shall be unlimited as to duration and territory.\nThis also includes in particular the right in relation to the deliverable with or without payment, to reproduced on all known storage media

works.<br>\n<br> 5.\nThe tester gives test IO the consent pursuant to \u00a7 34 and \u00a7 35 German Copyright Act to allow test IO to transfer the rights in deliverables in whole or in part to third parties or to grant third parties simple or exclusive rights of use <br>\n<br> 6.\nThe tester waives its right to designation of authorship and is not entitled to retain copies or originals of its deliverables and test IO accepts this waiver.<br>\n<br> 7.\nExclusive usage rights are transferred to test IO upon completion or termination of the work.\nPayment of the agreed compensation amount also satisfies any other claims of ownership.<br>\n<br>8.\nThe tester attests that none of the work he or she creates for test IO contains illegal content, especially content that violates the ownership, personality, or other intellectual property rights of any third party, or content that is criminally relevant in any way.\nThe tester is obligated to reimburse any expenses justifiably incurred by tester through third parties as a result of objections to content created by the tester.\nThis does not apply if the tester is not liable for the legal violation.\nIt is hereby expressly noted that test IO checks testers\u2019 work as a quality assurance measure, in particular for copyright-related violations.<br>\n<br>6.\nAs soon as the compensation due the tester as per Sections 3.7 and 4 has been established, but no later than two weeks after job order processing has finished, the corresponding credit voucher shall be issued to the tester\u2019s account as per the payment conditions specified in the job description.\nNo interest is paid on the credit vouchers.<br>\n<br>1.\nTesters may check the status of their credit vouchers at any time.\nAfter a tester\u2019s account has been activated by test IO, and no later than from the 1st up to and including the 20th day of any given month, the tester may press the payment button to have his or her credit vouchers be paid

as defined above.\nProof of business registration and/or demonstrated evidence of recognized freelancer status as well as a passed Screening may be deemed a precondition for payments to be made.\ntest IO is under no obligation to pay testers where doing so would violate any applicable laws.\n<br>\n<br>3.\nThe tester shall be responsible for all costs incurred by test IO as a result of the tester having provided bank account information which is incorrect or out-of-date.<br>\n<br>7.\ntest IO is authorized to retain, process and use data it receives from the tester, and data gathered in context of completing test IO job orders, to the extent that such data usage is necessary to ensure that job orders can be completed and contractual obligations fulfilled without difficulty.\ntest IO will

compensation.<br>\n<br>3.\nTesters undertake to maintain the confidentiality of the data and job descriptions submitted to them when performing test runs, and to use this information only for purposes
