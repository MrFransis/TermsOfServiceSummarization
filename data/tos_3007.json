section:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data that's been de-identified:</strong> We may de-identify your Personal Data so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners.\nWe may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience.\nHowever, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertisers:</strong> We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners

collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers.\nFor example, we might

their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.\nNote that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.\nSometimes Narvii conducts advertising campaigns on third party websites and applications (e.g., Facebook) (collectively, \u201cThird Party Platforms\u201d).\nIn those cases, we may disclose your information in personally identifiable form to the operators of the Third Party Platforms solely to allow them to direct our advertising content to you via the Third Party Platform.\nIn no event would we authorize such Third Party Platform Operators to reuse your email address in conjunction with other advertisers or for any other

or to other users?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your \"User Submission.\" Some User Submissions are viewable by other users.\nIn order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions.\nPlease note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy http://narvii.com/privacy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.</p>\n<p>For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Narvii a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, such as making sure your content is viewable on multiple mobile operating systems) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below.\nThis is a license only \u2013 your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.</p>\n<p>If you store a User Submission in your own personal Narvii account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a \"Personal User Submission\"), you grant Narvii the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.</p>\n<p>If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users)(a \"Limited Audience User Submission\"), then you grant Narvii the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so.\nAlso, you grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>\n<p>If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services (each of the foregoing, a \"Public User Submission\"), then you grant Narvii the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all Narvii users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with Narvii's business, provided that Narvii will try to notify you if it uses your Public User Submission for any reason other than displaying it on the Services.\nAlso, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>\n<p>You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide.</p>\n<p>Finally, you understand and agree that Narvii, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may

include the rights to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the \"DMCA\"), as it relates to online service providers, like Narvii, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone's copyright.\nWe respect others' intellectual property rights, and we

Services?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren't liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it.\nWe cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.\nWe can't guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.\nYou will keep all your registration information accurate and current.\nYou are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</p>\n<p>The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Narvii.\nWhen you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Narvii is not responsible for such risks.\nWe encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.</p>\n<p>Narvii has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services.\nIn addition, Narvii will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service.\nBy using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.</p>\n<p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.\nYou should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.\nYou agree that Narvii shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>\n<p>If there is a dispute between users of the Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that Narvii is under no obligation to become involved.\nIn the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Narvii, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services.\nIf you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.\"</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Will Narvii ever change the Services?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We're always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time.\nWe may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.\nWe'll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn't always practical.\nSimilarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does Amino Apps cost anything?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Most parts of our Services are currently free and do not require a premium subscription.\nSome parts of our services require a subscription, which you can purchase via the App and/or earn through your use of the App, as described below.\nWe reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future.\nWe will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How do I collect and redeem coins on Amino Apps?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, we may offer opportunities to earn \u201cAmino Coins\u201d by participating in promotions, trying out new features or content, viewing ads, or taking other actions (\u201cOffers\u201d).\nThese Offers are managed by a third party content and marketing partner (\u201cOffer Partner\u201d), and may require you to sign up for an account with the Offer Partner in order to participate in the Offers and earn Amino Coins.\nYour participation in the Offers and use of Offer Partner\u2019s services (including your eligibility to earn Amino Coins) is subject to all of the Offer Partner\u2019s terms and conditions applicable to your use of their services, including their terms and conditions.\nAny questions, issues or disputes concerning your Amino Coin balance or your eligibility to earn Amino Coins for participating in Offers are solely between you and the Offer Partner and we do not have any liability for your failure, inability or ineligibility to earn Amino Coins, or any issues arising from Offer Partner\u2019s operation or failure to operate its services.\nSubject to the Offer Partner\u2019s Terms, any Amino Coins you earn through Offers made available through the Service will be stored for your use in an \u201cAmino Wallet\u201d associated with your account.\nAmino Coins have no cash value and are not transferable.\nWe reserve the right to stop making Offers available through the Services, to withdraw any Offer at any time and to change or discontinue any or all opportunities to redeem Amino Coins via the Services at any time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How Do Premium Subscriptions Work?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Certain content, digital goods and other features of the Services are available only if you have a premium subscription to the Services (a \u201cPremium Subscription\u201d).\nYou can sign up for a Premium Subscription in the App by going to the subscription section of the App.\nThere, you will have the choice to pay for a Premium Subscription using your Apple ID or Google Play account, as applicable, or by redeeming Coins for Premium Subscription.</p>\n<p>If you purchase a Premium Subscription using your Apple ID or Google Play Account, you will be charged a monthly subscription fee.\nThe monthly fee for the Premium Subscription (\u201cSubscription Fee\u201d) will be charged to you each month in advance, to the credit card associated with your Apple ID or Google Play account.\nIf you redeem Coins for a Premium Subscription, we will debit your Amino Wallet for the number of Amino Coins needed for the initial Subscription Fee.\nThe Subscription Fee will be debited from your Amino Wallet each month in advance.\nNote that the number of Amino Coins needed for the initial Subscription Fee is not equivalent to any particular cash value.</p>\n<p>Subscription Fees (whether paid using your Apple ID or Google Play Account, or bought by redeeming Amino Coins) are non-refundable.\nYour enrollment in the Premium Subscription will be automatically renewed every month until you cancel your Premium Subscription.\nIf you wish to cancel auto-renewal of the Program for the following month, you must cancel your Premium Subscription prior to the auto-renewal date by going to the subscription section of the App and toggling off your auto-renew setting.\nIn addition to ending your subscription inside Amino, you may also be required to terminate your recurring payment via your account with the App Store or Google Play in order to stop payment.\nAmino is not responsible for any recurring charges issued by a failure to do so and will not grant refunds as a result of this failure.\nWe may change the Subscription Fee upon notice to you, but such change will only take effect once your then-current Premium Subscription term has ended.\nIf you do not wish to pay the new Subscription Fee, you must cancel your Premium Subscription prior to the expiration of your then-current Premium Subscription term.\nYou may cancel your Premium Subscription at any time, but again, no refunds will be granted for Subscription Fees you\u2019ve already paid, even if you don\u2019t use the Premium Subscription for the entire pre-paid period.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right (but we are under no obligation) to terminate your Premium Subscription in the event (i) your payment method is declined (ii) your Amino Wallet does not have enough Amino Coins to pay the Subscription Fee or (iii) you are banned from using the Services (e.g., we terminate your access as a result of your violation of these terms and conditions).\nIf Amino terminates your Premium Subscription, you may also be required to terminate your recurring payment via your account with the App Store or Google Play in order to stop payment.\nAmino is not responsible for any recurring charges issued by a failure to do so and will not grant refunds as a result of this failure.\nIn these cases, you will still be responsible to pay for all Subscription Fees that accrue under your account prior to cancellation by you or termination by us.\nIf you cancel your Premium Subscription or if we terminate your Premium Subscription, you will lose access to any features, content or tools for which a Premium Subscription is required.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What if I want to stop using Amino Apps?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You're free to do that at any time, by contacting us at support@aminoapps.com.\nplease refer to our Privacy Policy http://narvii.com/privacy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.</p>\n<p>Narvii is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.\nNarvii has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>\n<p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.\nWe will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone's safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Narvii.</p>\n<p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.\nBy way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I accessed Amino Apps via the Apple App Store - should I know anything about that?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad applications available via the Apple, Inc.\n(\"Apple\") App Store (the
