preferences.\nand</li>\n<li>to support marketing by enabling edX and Members to deliver content relevant to your interests on the edX Site and third-party sites based on how you interact with edX or Member advertisements or content.\nEdX and Members use \u201cfirst-party\u201d cookies, which means cookies served by edX or an individual Member, and also \u201cthird-party\u201d cookies, which means cookies served by third parties that help edX and Members track this information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You have some options for managing Cookies and other Tracking Technologies.\nThese include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Modifying your browser settings</u>: You should be able to control how and whether your web browser accepts Cookies by adjusting its privacy and security settings.\nThe \u201chelp\u201d feature of the menu bar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new Cookies, how to receive notification of new Cookies, and how to disable existing Cookies.\nIf you reject edX\u2019s Cookies, many functions and conveniences of the edX Site may not work properly.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Opting-out of certain third-party tracking and advertising</u>: Some of the third parties used by edX or a Member for Cookies and Tracking Technologies offer the ability to opt-out from their tracking by following processes described on their websites.\nA list of some such third

any third-party opt-out options.</li>\n</ul>How Your Information Is Used<p>EdX and Members use information, including Personal Information, to carry out the following

employers, government programs, institutions, or other enterprises that sponsor your enrollment in a course for training or other educational purposes</b> \u2013 If an entity pays for or otherwise

safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information that it collects, receives, stores, or transmits.\nNonetheless, no method of

below.</p>Certificates.<p>edX and the Members may offer Verified Certificates of Achievement for courses (a \"Verified Certificate\") or certificates for programs (for example, a MicroMasters program

accepted.\nand</li>\n<li>Be current and valid.\nexpired documents cannot be accepted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unfortunately, if you do not possess a photo ID meeting the criteria described above, edX is unable to provide you with a Verified Certificate at this time.</p>Refunds.<p>Certificates and other purchases on the edX Site may be eligible for a refund for a period of time (in each case, the \u201cRefund Period\u201d).\nThe applicable Refund Period for some products and services are described below.\nTo receive a refund during the Refund Period, simply unenroll from the course and the refund will be processed automatically.\nRefunds will be credited to the payment account used for the purchase and may take up to two billing cycles to process.\nFor more info, visit the edX Help
