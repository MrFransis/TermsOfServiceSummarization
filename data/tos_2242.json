note that we cannot always reply - although we do our best.</p>\nFAQ\n<p>Q: <strong>How can I view the spam folder?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A: There is no spam folder / spam box.\nAll emails that arrive at Guerrilla Mail are delivered to your inbox.\nIf an email didn't arrive, it's most likely a problem on the other side, unless we're having a bad day...\nIf you are a webmaster, Guerrilla Mail can also be used to test if your site sends the emails out correctly.</p>\n<p>Q: <strong>What is a Scrambled Address?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A: Since Guerrilla Mail doesn't require account registration, anyone who knows the Inbox ID may have access to that inbox.\nSo it's best to use a random address.\nTo add protection, you can use the Scramble Address feature.\nA Scrambled Address can only be know if the Inbox ID is known and you cannot use a Scrambled as an Inbox Id.\nThe more hard-to-guess your Inbox ID is, the better your Alias will protect you.\n</p>\n<p> Q: <strong>Do email addresses expire?</strong>\n</p>\n<p> A: The current version keeps all incoming email for 1 hour.\nThis means all addresses work all the time, they never expire.</p>\n<p>\nWhen an email arrives at Guerrilla Mail, it waits in the quarantine ready to be picked up.\nIf a user checks their inbox, Guerrilla Mail will check the quarantine for new email.\nIf found, the email will be instantly moved to the user's inbox.\nElse, emails will be deleted from the quarantine if they wait there for longer than one hour.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnce the email is in an inbox, it will be given 1 hour more, or until the user deletes it.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Emails that were never delivered to an active inbox are marked abandoned and are most likely spam.</p>\n<p>\n(The older version of Guerrilla Mail expired the address after 1 hour and bounced any inactive addresses.)</p>\nPrivacy\n<p>Guerrilla Mail deletes all email that was delivered to an inbox after 1 hour.</p>\n<p>We normally keep the logs turned off, this is because due to high traffic, our server does not have the resources required</p>\n<p>Emails delivered to an inbox are treated with the most privacy, however, please note that anyone who knows your Inbox ID may access your inbox.\nUsing a Scrambled Address will further protect your privacy.\nPlease see the FAQ for further information.</p>\n<p>This site uses a session cookie to maintain application state.\nOther cookies may be used to remember your preferences.\nIt also uses third-party cookies including Google Analytics and Google Adsense.</p>\n<p>We may use anonymized email data for further anti-spam, anti-malware or anti-phishing research.\nOnly email data that is obvious spam is used for this research.</p>\n<p>Our website can only be accessed with HTTPS encryption</p>\nOur Technology\n<p>Guerrilla Mail consists of a web server (Nginx), a database server (MySQL) and a Mail Server (Go Guerrilla).\nThe design goal and purpose of Go Guerrilla is to receive large volumes of email and nothing much else.\nIt happily gobbles down millions of emails daily.\nGo Guerrilla is an open source project available from GitHub.\nIf you do invite Go Guerrilla to your system, please
