the risk of misuse, unauthorized access and disclosure, and loss of access.\nSome of these safeguards include the use of pseudonymization, data encryption, data hashing, and other technologies and permission control methods.\nWhen our employees directly handle or access your personal information, we do so on secured networks and through fine-grained permission control to limit who can access your information.\nData you provide to us is encrypted and stored on both third-party storage and on Synology-managed devices, depending on the service.</p>\n<p>Synology logs and stores IP addresses of both users to our web services solely for security purposes.\nThis log is archived and then removed at irregular intervals depending on ongoing or existing security threats or investigations.\nIf

such behavior to relevant authorities.</p>\n<p>Synology removes data that is no longer required to provide services based on each service.</p> Changes to Statement <p>Synology may make amendments to
