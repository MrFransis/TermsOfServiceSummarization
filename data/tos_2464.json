<p>\n<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>This is our updated Privacy Policy that took effect on February 15, 2018.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your privacy is critically important to us.\nAt Brad Goodman Solutions, we have a few fundamental principles:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our serviworces.</li>\n<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>\n<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information shared and permanently deleted.</li>\n<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>\n<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is Brad Goodman Solutions\u2019 privacy policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are the folks behind the Emergency Services Scheduler which provides tools to you and your organization to help you do your job quickly and efficiently.\nOur mission is to combine all the tools you commonly use into one platform built on your suggestions.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our websites (including bradgoodmansolutions.com and esscheduler.com);</li>\n<li>Our mobile applications (including the BGS Messenger for Android).\nand</li>\n<li>Other products and services that are available on or through our websites (including Google calendar sync platforms).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we\u2019ll refer to our website, mobile applications and other products and services collectively as \u201cServices.\u201d<br>\nBelow we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.<br>\nPlease note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy.<br>\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information We Collect</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so\u2013for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>\n<p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources.\nLet\u2019s go over the information that we collect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information You Provide to Us</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It\u2019s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us.\nThe amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information.\nHere are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic Account Information:&nbsp;</strong>We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.\nFor example, we require individuals who sign up for a Brad Goodman Solutions&nbsp;account to provide your name, a login and email address\u2013and that\u2019s it.\nYou may provide us with more information\u2013like your phone number(s) and cell phone number\u2013but we don\u2019t require that information to create your account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public Profile Information:&nbsp;</strong>If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile.\nThis public profile is only public to your organization and is not accessible to the general public or anyone outside your organization.\nYour public profile is just that\u2013public\u2013so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content Information:&nbsp;</strong>Depending on the Services you use, you may also provide us with information about you in the content for your profile and features.\nFor example, if you write a note with your leave request or availability that includes biographic information about you, we will have that information, and so will anyone with access to your approval of these items.\nThis might be obvious to you\u2026but it\u2019s not to everyone!</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Credentials:&nbsp;</strong>We do not store credentials for other service providers that you provide \u2013 for example, when you authorize the Google Calendar sync.\nYour credentials as sent to Google which provides us with a token that allows changes to your calendar.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications with Us:&nbsp;</strong>You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our engineers about a support question, or post a question about your site in our public forums.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information We Collect Automatically</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Log Information:&nbsp;</strong>Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.\nWe collect log information when you use our Services\u2013for example, when you create or make changes to your website on bradgoodmansolutions.com.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Usage Information:</strong>We collect information about your usage of our Services.\nFor example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site\u2013in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [user name] added availability for &nbsp;[time/date]).\nWe also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at bradgoodmansolutions.com, button clicks) along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer).\nWe use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location Information:&nbsp;</strong>We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.\nWe collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stored Information:&nbsp;</strong>We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile app.\nWe access this stored information through your device operating system\u2019s permissions.\n&nbsp;For example, if you give us permission to access the Brad Goodman Solutions database storage on your mobile device\u2019s database, our Services may access the database stored on your device to make the application operate.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information from Cookies &amp.\nOther Technologies:&nbsp;</strong>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nBrad Goodman Solutions uses cookies and other technologies to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand e-mail campaign effectiveness.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Information We Collect from Other Sources</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may also get information about you from other sources.\nFor example, if you create or log into your Brad Goodman Solutions account through another service (like Google) we will receive information from that service (such as your username, and basic profile information) via the authorization procedures used by that service.\nThe information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.&nbsp.\nYour agency also has the option to link your account to publicly accessible websites to verify your licenses and credentials.&nbsp.\nWe will make every attempt to link your profile correctly and it is your responsibility to inform your Administrators and/or Brad Goodman Solutions should your imported data be incorrect.</p>\n<p>We may also get information from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users (\u2026but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Use Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide our Services\u2013for example, to set up and maintain your account, host your scheduling suite, and backup and restore your scheduling suite;</li>\n<li>To further develop our Services\u2013for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or will help them to create and manage their websites more efficiently;</li>\n<li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>\n<li>To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Brad Goodman Solutions and others;</li>\n<li>To communicate with you about offers and promotions offered by Brad Goodman Solutions and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on Brad Goodman Solutions and our products.\nand</li>\n<li>To personalize your experience using our Services, provide content recommendations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>How We Share Information</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not sell our users\u2019 private personal information.<br>\nWe share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent

information that we share with them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third Party Vendor</strong>\n<strong>s:</strong>We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about

necessary to protect the property or rights of Brad Goodman Solutions, third parties, or the public at large.\nFor example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Transfer</strong>\n<strong>s:</strong>In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Brad Goodman Solutions goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information

party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With Your Consent:</strong>We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.\nFor example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so, such as the Google with our Google Calendar Sync feature.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Aggregated and De-Identified Information:&nbsp;</strong>We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you.\nFor instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Published Support Requests</strong>\n<strong>:</strong>And

information indexed by search engines or used by third parties.\nPlease keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Security</strong>\n</p>\n<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choices</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Limit the Information that You Provide:</strong>If
