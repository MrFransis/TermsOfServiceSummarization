safeguards (e.g.\nstandard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)).\nThrough our Binding Corporate Rules, the eBay Inc.\ncorporate family members undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations.\nFurther information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the eBay Privacy Center - opens in new window or tab.</p> 6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries) <p>We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to third countries, i.e.\ncountries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards.\nThird countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland, the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand and Uruguay.&nbsp;In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g.\nthrough the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g.\nstandard data protection clauses (2010/87/EU, 2001/497/EC or 2004/915/EC)) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law.\nA copy of the documentation of the measures taken by us is available on request.</p> &nbsp.\n7.\n&nbsp;Storage duration and erasure\n&nbsp.\n<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients for more information on the processing purposes).\nSubsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged to keep your personal data longer (e.g.\nfor legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes).\nIn Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g.\nfor contracts, notifications and business letters).\nAs far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g.\nby restricting access to it).\nThis applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law.\nIn these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods.\nThe data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p> Learn more about section 7 <p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines.\nHow long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law.\nThe following factors typically affect the retention period:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong>\n<br> This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records.\nMost of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Special categories of personal data</strong>\n<br> If we store special categories of personal data (i.e., personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data which is being processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation), a shorter retention period is usually appropriate.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent-based processing of personal data</strong>\n<br> If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong>\n<br> Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders.\nIt may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes.\nPersonal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.</li>\n</ul> &nbsp.\n8.\n&nbsp;Rights as a data subject\n&nbsp.\n<p>Subject to possible restrictions under national law, as a data subject, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing and data portability with regard to your personal data.\nIn

authority.</p> Learn more about section 8 <p>Your rights in detail:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> to the processing of your personal data by us at any time.\nAs a

withdrawal.</li>\n<li>You have the right to obtain <strong>access</strong> to your personal data that is being processed by us.\nIn particular, you may request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, any available information as to the personal data\u2019s source (where they are not collected from you), the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details.\nYour right to access may be limited by national law.</li>\n<li>You have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the <strong>rectification</strong> of inaccurate personal data concerning you.\nTaking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</li>\n<li>You have the right to obtain from us the <strong>erasure</strong> of personal data concerning you, unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nThe right to erasure may be limited by national law.</li>\n<li>You have the right to obtain from us <strong>restriction of processing</strong> to the extent that <ul>\n<li>the accuracy of the data is disputed by you,</li>\n<li>the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the personal data,</li>\n<li>we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or</li>\n<li>you have objected to the processing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller (\"<strong>right to data portability</strong>\").</li>\n<li>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a <strong>supervisory authority</strong>.\nAs a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence, your place of work or the registered office of the

grounds relating to your particular situation.\nThis also applies to profiling.\nIf your personal data is processed by us for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.</p>\n<p>The exercise of the above data subjects' rights (e.g.\nright to access or erasure) is generally free of charge.\nWhere requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may charge an appropriate fee (at most our actual costs) in accordance with the applicable statutory regulations or refuse to process the application.</p> Exercising your rights and managing your settings <p>You can exercise your rights as a data subject via our Privacy Contact page&nbsp;- opens in new window or tab.\nIn addition, you are of course free to contact us.</p>\n<p>If you would like to change your preferences

contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.</p> Learn more about section 11 What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications? <p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users.\nFor example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments.\nOther users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile.</p>\n<p>When you use our Services, your public user ID may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity.\nNotices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public user ID and specific items.\nAccordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.</p>\n<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments.\nHowever, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, user ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.&nbsp;For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g.\na seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item).\nIn this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g.\ncompleting a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).</p> Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay <p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been cancelled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address).\nIndependent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.</p>\n<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users.\nAs a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g.\ngive them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.</p>\n<p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates.\nUsing personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our User Agreement.</p> Personal data relating to third parties <p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible.\nYou must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.</p> Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools <p>All messages sent via our messaging tools are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient.\nAll messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria.\nIf necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service.\nIn the event of a violation of our User Agreement (including any of our rules and policies), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.</p>\n<p>This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g.\nspam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our User Agreement and our other rules and policies (e.g.\nillegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay.</p> Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us? <p>Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g.\ndata by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the Payments Terms of Use.\nFor example, under the Payments Terms of Use you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfil our legal \"Know Your Customer\" (KYC) obligations.\nAs described elsewhere in our User Privacy Notice and in the Payments Terms of Use, we may share this data with other eBay group companies in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus.\nAlthough the provision of any other personal data (e.g.\naddress and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.</p> Children's Privacy <p>Our services are not intended for the use by children.\nWe do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws.\nUnder&nbsp;our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.</p> Staying Signed in <p>When you sign in to your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed in to your account for certain amount of time.\nIf you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline.\nYou or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will

purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients for more information on the processing purposes).\nSubsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged to keep your personal data longer (e.g.\nfor tax, accounting or auditing purposes).\nIn Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g.\nfor contracts, notifications and business letters).\nAs far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g.\nby restricting access to it).\nThis applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims.\nIn these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods.\nThe data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p> Learn more <p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines.\nHow long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law.\nThe following factors

basis of this general rule.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Special categories of personal data</strong>\n<br> If we store special categories of personal data, a shorter retention period is usually appropriate.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent-based processing of personal data</strong>\n<br> If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong>\n<br> Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders.\nIt may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes.\nPersonal data contained in contracts,

clear GIFs) are small graphic images that are used in connection with the provision of our services and which typically work in conjunction with cookies to track the use of an online service by its users.\nFor example, when we send you emails, web beacons allow us to track if you opened the emails and clicked links to measure campaign performance and improve features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.1.3 Similar technologies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Similar technologies are technologies which enable the entity using it to track your user behavior.\nThis can be done by local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies and other web application software methods, all of which store information in your browser or device.\nAdditionally, there are other technologies that function without local storage in your end device and instead make use of, inter alia, browser functions.\nIn this context, a \"fingerprint\" of your system is created that serves as a unique identifier.</p>\n<p>These technologies may function across all your browsers and in some cases are not fully managed by your browser, but may need to be managed directly from your installed applications or your device.\nWe sometimes use the terms cookies and similar technologies interchangeably.</p> 1.2 Why do we use these technologies <p>Some of our Services can only be offered using

you advertisements.</p>\n<p>Authorized service providers are entitled to place web beacons and similar technologies within our online services and to place cookies on your device, as far as this is permissible according to applicable law.\nIn this context, data for the identification of your device will be tracked, for example the IP address, the device ID or the advertising ID (IDFA - ID for Advertising or Google Advertising ID).</p>\n<p>This enables the service providers to help us deliver content and more relevant advertisements, and to produce anonymous metrics and analytics, including conversion statistics.\nThe processing of personal data by external service providers is subject to data protection and confidentiality agreements with us and applicable data protection laws.\nWith regard to data processing by service providers, please check the privacy notices of the respective third-party providers.</p>\n<p>Service providers that we cooperate with include Facebook and Google:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Facebook</strong>: Provision of advertising services via Facebook's advertising and marketing platforms, e.g.\nWebsite Custom Audiences (Facebook's Data Policy - opens

permit any third-party content on sites (such as item listings, communication between users, classified listings, comments, reviews, etc.) to include or utilize any cookies, web beacons, local storage, or similar technologies for tracking purposes or to collect your personal data for the own purposes of such third parties.\nIf you suspect that an offer or third-party content within our

and their privacy notices within the advertising preferences - opens in new window or tab.</p> 1.4 Google Analytics <p>We use Google Analytics, an analysis tool of Google LLC and Google Ireland Ltd.\n(\"Google\") to continuously improve our Services.\nThe use includes the Universal Analytics operating mode.\nThis makes it possible to assign data, sessions and interactions across multiple devices to a pseudonymous user ID and thus analyze a user's activities across multiple devices.\nGoogle Analytics uses cookies that are stored on your device and that enable us to analyze your use of our Services.\nThe data collected by the cookies regarding the use of our Services (including your IP address) are usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there (see additional information for users in the European Economic Area below in this section).</p>\n<p>On our behalf, Google processes this data to evaluate the use of our Services, to compile reports on usage activities and to provide us with further services associated with the use of our Services.\nYour IP address transmitted in the context of Google Analytics will not be combined with other data from Google.</p>\n<p>The data collected via Google Analytics is automatically deleted after 14 months.\nData whose retention period has been reached is automatically deleted once a month.</p>\n<p>You can prevent the collection of data through the Google Analytics cookie by adjusting your browser settings accordingly.\nIf you deactivate cookies, you may not be able to use all functions of our Services to their full extent, however.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can prevent the collection of data related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) via the Google Analytics cookie and the processing of this data by Google by installing the following browser plugin - opens in new window or tab.</p>\n<p>Further information about Google Analytics can be found in the terms of use - opens in new window or tab and in the privacy policy - opens in new window or tab of Google.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional information for users in the European Economic Area (EEA):</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We would like to point out that on our website Google Analytics has been extended by the code \"gat._anonymizeIp();\" in order to guarantee an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).\nThis means that, before your IP address is transmitted to Google's servers in the USA, it is sent to a Google server in the EU (or in another member state of the EEA), where it is shortened so that it cannot be traced to a specific person.\nOnly after the IP address has been made anonymous is the shortened IP address sent to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>\n<p>If personal data is transferred to the USA, this happens on the basis of the adequacy decision of the European Commission under the EU-US Privacy Shield.\nYou can download the certificate here - opens in new window or tab.</p> 1.5&nbsp;Google Signals <p>We also use Google Signals in connection with the provision of our Services.\nThis is an extension function of Google Analytics that enables cross-device tracking.\nThis means that if your Internet-enabled devices are linked to your Google Account, Google can generate reports on usage patterns (especially cross-device traffic) even if you switch devices.\nIf you have activated the setting \"personalized ads\" in your Google account, Google will process data for this purpose.\nWe do not process personal data in this respect, we only receive statistics based on Google Signals.</p>\n<p>You can deactivate the use of Google Signals at any time by downloading and installing the browser plugin in order to opt-out of Google Analytics (see above under Google Analytics).\nThis will prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the Services (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google.\nIn addition, you can disable the \"personalized advertising\" setting in your Google Account.\nDetails can be found here - opens in new window or tab.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Users in the European Economic Area (EEA):</strong>\n<br>\nYou can determine via the advertising preferences - opens in new window or tab (\"Google Advertising\") whether you consent to the use of Google Signals.\nWe only use Google Signals with your consent.</p> 1.6&nbsp;Google reCAPTCHA: Prevention of automated access <p>We make use of Google reCAPTCHA (\"reCAPTCHA\") within the provision of our Services.\nreCAPTCHA is used to check and prevent interactions through automated access, for example through so-called bots (computer programs that perform tasks automatically and independently).\nreCAPTCHA is used in particular to check whether data input in connection with our Services (e.g.\nin a contact form) is carried out by a human or by an automated program.\nFor this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the user on the basis of various characteristics.\nThis analysis automatically begins as soon as the user connects with the online service, e.g.\nvisits the website.\nFor the purposes of this analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various pieces of information (e.g.\nIP address, duration of the user's visit to the online service or the user's mouse movements).\nThe data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google.\nThe analyses by reCAPTCHA are carried out entirely in the background.</p>\n<p>Please find details regarding Google reCAPTCHA here - opens in new window or tab and in Google's Privacy Notice - opens in new window or tab.</p> 1.7&nbsp;Which security measures do we take to protect your data? <p>We protect our cookies

listing category, transaction value, or the filing of an eBay Money Back Guarantee case.\nThis may result in PayPal restricting funds in your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>In connection with managed

cancellations on our Services, or file eBay Money Back Guarantee claims on our Services, in the same manner as you do for transactions for which the payments entity does not manage payments.\nThe

related third parties) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.</strong>\n</p> A.\nApplicable Law <p>You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.</p> B.\nAgreement to Arbitrate <p>\n<strong>You and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (or any related third parties) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to our Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nAlternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>YOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND

PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).\nANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.</strong> If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim or a particular request for a remedy (such as a request for injunctive relief), then that claim or that remedy request (and only that claim or that remedy request) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and eBay's right to appeal the court's decision.\nAll other claims will be arbitrated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court can award to an individual.\nAn arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules and the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.\nIn the event that the AAA is unavailable to administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or the court.</p>\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a valid Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"), which may be downloaded at this link - opens in new window or tab.\nThe Notice to eBay must be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W.\neBay Way, Draper, UT 84020.\neBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account.\nit is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date.\nTo be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the email address and phone number associated with your account.</p>\n<p>If you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in a valid Notice within 30 days after eBay receives that Notice, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org.\nIn addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party.\nYou may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc.\nc/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047.\nIn the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account.\nAny settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nWhere no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000, the dispute shall be resolved by the submission of documents only, subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.\nIn cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf you complied with the Notice of Dispute procedures of Section 2 of this Agreement (\"Arbitration Procedures\") and the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.\nAny request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay administration and arbitrator fees directly to the AAA.\nIn the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability</strong>\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt-Out Procedure</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO REJECT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE

eBay Money Back Guarantee case.\nThis may result in PayPal restricting funds in your PayPal account.</p>\n<p>In connection with managed payments as described in Section 14, we may also restrict user

automate replacements, returns, and refunds under certain circumstances.\nFor all new sellers, in listings where returns are accepted, eBay will set a default rule that automates the return process.\nSellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account settings within My eBay.\nWhere settings have been set to automatically accept requests for returns or replacements, an eBay-generated return shipping label will be provided to your buyer.\nYou agree to comply with our returns policy.<br> When an item is returned, to refund the buyer, you (as seller) authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the refund amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file.<br> The cost of

or eBay under the eBay Money Back Guarantee, you authorize eBay to request that PayPal remove the reimbursement amount (in same or other currency) from your PayPal account, place the amount on your invoice, and/or charge your payment method on file.\nIf we cannot get reimbursement from you, we may collect the outstanding sums using other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies.<br> We may suspend the eBay Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if we suspect abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Managed Payments</strong>\n<br> eBay has launched a new managed payments service, where a designated eBay entity (each, a \"payments entity\") manages payments on behalf of sellers (such management described as \"managed payments\" or similar).\nSome eBay sellers have already enrolled in managed payments.\neBay anticipates moving more seller accounts to managed payments in phases starting in July 2020, providing notice to the affected sellers as they are scheduled to be moved.<br> When we enable your account for managed payments, to continue to list and sell on eBay, as directed by the payments entity, each transitioned eBay seller registered in the US must: <ul>\n<li>provide the payments entity with information about you and/or your business to meet its compliance requirements, including those involving identity verification, anti-money laundering controls, and sanctions screening as required by applicable laws and policies.\nand</li>\n<li>pass such verification and screening and otherwise meet the compliance requirements of the payments entity, as determined by the payments entity.\nand</li>\n<li>provide bank account information for a U.S.-based checking account so that the payments entity can link such checking account to your eBay account, allowing the payments entity to pay you</li>\n</ul> In addition: <ul>\n<li>the payments entity may obtain information about you from third-parties to verify your identity, comply with anti-money laundering and sanctions screening obligations, and for other purposes in connection with managed payments</li>\n<li>the payments entity may use third-party payments service providers to assist it in providing managed payments services, including companies that process payments, perform risk assessments (such as credit agencies) or compliance checks, verify identity, and validate payment methods.\neBay, the payments entity, and their affiliates may send personal data associated with you and your account to such third-parties</li>\n</ul> The payments entity may, in its sole discretion, manage payments on your behalf even if you haven't provided all requested information, and the payments entity may withhold payouts pending receipt of such information.<br> The complete terms governing sellers' use of managed payments are available in the Payments Terms of Use - opens in new window or tab, incorporated herein.\nYou agree to the Payments Terms of Use - opens in new window or tab to the extent applicable to you, whether or not your account has been enabled for managed payments.<br> The contract for sale underlying the purchase of goods is directly concluded between seller and the buyer in the same manner as for transactions for which the payments entity does not manage payments.<br> If you are a buyer completing a purchase from a seller that is using managed payments: <ul>\n<li>You may pay for such items using those payment methods that the payments entity makes available, and the payments entity will manage settlement to sellers.\nBy completing purchases from sellers who use managed payments, buyers authorize the payments entity to initiate payments using the buyers' selected payment method and collect the transaction amounts on behalf of sellers.\nBuyers agree and understand that, with respect to payments transactions initiated on ebay.com, the applicable payments entity is eBay Commerce Inc.\n(\"eCI\"), and that eCI has been appointed as an agent of sellers who use managed payments for the limited purpose of accepting such payments on behalf of sellers.\nAccordingly, payments received by eCI from buyers satisfy buyers' obligations to pay sellers in the amount of payments received</li>\n<li>In certain instances, your transaction may be declined, frozen, or held for any reason including for suspected fraud, AML compliance, compliance with economic or trade sanctions, in connection with eBay\u2019s internal risk controls or due to potential violations of any policy of eBay or the payments entity, or a policy of one of the payments entity's third party payments services providers</li>\n<li>eBay, the payments entity or its affiliates may save payment information, such as credit card or debit card numbers, and card expiration dates, entered by you on eBay Services when you make a purchase, redeem a coupon, or make any other transaction on eBay Services where card information is entered.\nSuch stored payment information may be used as your default payment method for future transactions on eBay Services.\nAt any time, you can update your card information or enter new card information, at which point the new card information shall be stored as your default payment method.\nYou may make changes to your default payment method through the Personal Information section under the Account tab in My eBay.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of information we have on file, and you consent to eBay updating such stored information from time to time based on information provided by you, your bank or other payments services providers.\nYou will only provide information about payment methods that you are authorized to use.</li>\n<li>You may seek returns or cancellations on eBay Services, or file eBay Money Back Guarantee claims on eBay Services, in the same manner as you do for transactions for which the payments entity does not manage payments.\nThe payments entity refunds amounts paid for successful eBay Money Back Guarantee claims and returned or cancelled transactions in cases where the original payment was managed by the payments entity.\nRefund timing may vary in accordance with the rules of third parties, such as credit and debit card networks</li>\n<li>You agree to comply with, and not cause a third party to violate, all applicable laws, regulations, rules and terms and conditions in connection with the use of managed payments.\nYou understand that some third parties, such as credit and debit card issuers, credit and debit card networks and payments services providers, may have their own terms and conditions for the payment or settlement methods you choose to use in connection with managed payments transactions.\nFailure to abide by third party terms and conditions may result in fees assessed to you (for example, currency conversion fees from your credit card issuer if the transaction currency is different from your credit card currency) or other actions taken by such third parties, and you agree that the payments entity has no control over, or responsibility or liability for, such fees or actions</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> Disclaimer of Warranties.\nLimitation of Liability <p>We try to keep our Services safe, secure, and functioning properly, but we cannot

officers, directors, agents and employees) are not liable, and you agree not to hold us responsible, for any damages or losses (including, but not limited to, loss of money, goodwill or reputation,

exclusions may not apply to you.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the previous paragraphs, if we are found to be liable, our liability to you or to any third party is limited to the greater of (a) any amounts due under the eBay Money Back Guarantee up to the price the item sold for on eBay (including any applicable sales tax) and its original shipping costs, (b) the amount of fees in dispute not to exceed the total fees, which you paid to us in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to the liability, or (c) $100.</p> Release <p>If you have a dispute with one or more users, you release us (and our affiliates and subsidiaries, and our and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\n<strong>In entering into this release you expressly waive any protections (whether statutory or otherwise) that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</strong>\n</p> Indemnity <p>You will indemnify and hold us (including our affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as our and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents) harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable

Legal Disputes <p>\n<strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.\nIT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND EBAY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You and eBay agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (including any claim or dispute between you and a third-party agent of eBay) that relates in any way to or arises out of this or previous versions of this User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold or purchased through the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nApplicable Law</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Utah, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this User Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and eBay, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nAgreement to Arbitrate</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen, or may arise, between you and eBay (including any disputes or claims between you and a third-party agent of eBay) that relate in any way to or arise out of this or previous versions of the User Agreement, your use of or access to the Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products or services sold, offered, or purchased through the Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nAlternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>YOU AND EBAY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).\nANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.</strong> If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court, subject to your and eBay's right to appeal the court's decision.\nAll other claims will be arbitrated.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.\nAn arbitrator should apply the terms of the User Agreement as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org.\nThe use of the word \"arbitrator\" in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration.\nrather, the AAA's rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under this Agreement to Arbitrate.</p>\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\").\nYou may download a form Notice - opens in new window or tab.\nThe Notice to eBay should be sent to eBay Inc., Attn: Litigation Department, Re: Notice of Dispute, 583 W.\neBay Way, Draper, UT 84020.\neBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account.\nit is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date.\nAll information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.</p>\n<p>If you and eBay are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or eBay may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's site at www.adr.org.\nIn addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party.\nYou may send a copy to eBay at the following address: eBay, Inc.\nc/o CT Corporation System, 1108 E South Union Ave., Midvale, UT 84047.\nIn the event eBay initiates an arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your eBay account.\nAny settlement offer made by you or eBay shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>The arbitration hearing shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or eBay may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and eBay subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.\nIn cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or eBay may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, eBay will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.\nAny request for payment of fees by eBay should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and eBay will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf (a) you willfully fail to comply with the Notice of Dispute requirement discussed above, or (b) in the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse eBay for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by eBay on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability</strong>\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt-Out Procedure</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN
