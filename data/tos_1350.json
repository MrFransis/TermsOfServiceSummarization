have standards in place to protect the personal information that we collect about you that is necessary and incidental to running our business and making our services available to you and others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By publishing this Privacy Policy we aim to make it easy for our customers and the public to understand what personal information we collect and store, why we do so, how we receive and/or obtain that information and the rights you have with respect to your personal information in our possession.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This Privacy Policy follows the standards of the Australian Privacy Principles set by the Australian Government for the handling of personal information under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n2.\nWho, and what, this policy applies to\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy deals with how we handle \u201cpersonal information\u201d, which is information that can be used (or is reasonably likely to) identify an individual.\nIt does not apply to information we collect about businesses or companies, however it does apply to information about the people in those businesses or companies.\nThe Privacy Policy applies to all forms of information, physical and digital, whether collected or stored electronically or in hardcopy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If, at any time, you provide personal or other information about someone other than yourself, you warrant that you have that person\u2019s consent to provide such information for the purpose specified.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n3.\nThe information we collect\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In the course of business it is necessary for us to collect personal information.\nWe always let you know when we are collecting information.\nThis information allows us to identify who you are for the purposes of our business, contact you in the ordinary course of business and transact with you.\nWithout limitation, the type of information we may collect about you is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Identity Information.\nWe may collect personal details such as your name, location, date of birth, nationality, details of licenses &amp.\nregistrations, associations, family details, passwords, clues, employment details and third-party usernames and other information that allows us to identify who you are;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Contact Information.\nWe may collect information such as your email address, telephone &amp.\nfax number, third-party usernames, residential, business and postal address and other information that allows us to contact you;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Financial Information.\nWe may collect information about your finances such as your bank accounts and credit cards, the value of transactions you undertake with us or through our services, the value of certain assets that you declare to us and other information that allows us to transact with you and/or provide you with our services.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Statistical Information.\nWe may collect information about your online and offline preferences, habits, movements, trends, decisions, associations, memberships, finances, purchases and other information for statistical purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Health Information.\nWe

receive social information about your employment, family, income, social &amp.\ncommunity services, although we do not have access to this information.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This information is necessary for our business activities because it allows us to identify who you are for the purposes of our business, and also allows us to perform administrative and operational tasks for the purposes of our business.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We may collect other personal information about you, which we will maintain in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may also collect non-personal information about you such as information regarding your computer, network and browser.\nThis may include your IP address.\nWhere non-personal information is collected the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Individuals have the option to not identify themselves to us, or to use a pseudonym, unless we are required or authorised by law to deal with individuals who have identified themselves, or it is impracticable for us to deal with individuals who have not identified themselves.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may directly or indirectly collect or receive sensitive information.\nWhere we collect sensitive information we will comply with the requirements under the Australian Privacy Principles to:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>a.\nseek consent before collecting the sensitive information and ensure that the information is reasonably necessary for one or more of our functions or activities (unless an exemption in the Australian Privacy Principles applies), where the information is directly solicited.\nor</p>\n<p>b.\nwhere the information is unsolicited, destroy or de-identify the information if we determine that we could not have obtained the information if we had sought to solicit it directly (and the information is not containing a Commonwealth record).</p>\n4.\nHow your information is collected\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Most information will be collected in association with your use, custom, enquiry or dealings with us, but will at all times be collected only by lawful and fair means.\nHowever we may also receive your personal information from sources such as advertising, your own promotions, public records, mailing lists, contractors, staff, recruitment agencies and our business partners.\nIn particular, your information is likely to be collected as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Our Customers.\nWe may indirectly receive information as a result of our customer\u2019s use of our systems and services, especially where you access services provided by our customers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Registrations/Subscriptions.\nWhen you register or subscribe for a service, list, account, connection or other

circumstances in which we may collect your information both electronically and physically.\nWe will endeavour to ensure that you are always aware of when your personal information is being collected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will take all reasonable steps to protect all personal information collected from misuse, interference, loss and unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we no longer require the personal information for any specified purpose, the information is not contained in a Commonwealth record, and we are not required by, or under, an Australian law or court to retain the information, then we will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify the information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n5.\nWhen your personal is information used &amp.\ndisclosed\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The primary principle is that we will not use the information you provide us other than for

submitted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your information is used to enable us to operate our business, especially as it relates to you.\nThis may include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The provision of goods and

circumstances.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are some circumstances in which we must disclose your information that you should be aware of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>As part of a sale (or proposed sale) of all

and external professionals and advisors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You acknowledge that the security of online transactions and the security of communications sent by electronic means or by post cannot be guaranteed.\nYou provide information to us via the internet or by post at your own risk.\nWe cannot accept responsibility for misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, your personal information

parties that we are permitted to disclose your personal information to in accordance with this policy or any applicable laws).\nThe collection and use of your information by such third party/ies may
