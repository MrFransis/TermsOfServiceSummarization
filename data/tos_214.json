Why do we use your personal information? <p>We use your personal information in order to provide and improve our Services, to comply with legal obligations and to advertise our Services and to keep our Services safe and secure.\nPlease find below how we use your personal information specifically and on what legal grounds we base the use of your personal information.</p> Activities &amp.\npurposes <ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Service</strong>: the most important reason for using your personal information is, of course, to offer you our Services as mentioned in our Terms of Service, for example to create or visualize your Content or share your ideas and to let you access and use your Content across different devices.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Support</strong>: we provide a wide range of support services to help you out whenever you\u2019re in need, for instance when you need technical assistance.\nIf it\u2019s needed to offer support, the Support-team can, on your request, access your Content in order to help you out.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Account &amp.\nbilling</strong>: creating and upholding your personal account for example to facilitate your address book and to enable you to access your Content across different devices, facilitating payment of your subscription fee and perform accounting, auditing &amp.\nbilling activities.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Safety, integrity &amp.\nsecurity</strong>: WeTransfer follows up on abuse reports, NTD/DMCA reports, fraud investigations and could investigate your compliance with our of our Terms of Services and/or API Terms of Use.\nFurthermore, we detect &amp.\nblock Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (CSAI).\nDetection of CSAI leads to automated decisions whether such Content is potential CSAI.\nCases of potential CSAI will be reported directly to law enforcement agencies.\nFurthermore, we protect ourselves against fraud and other illegal activities.\nIn all these cases we withhold the right to preserve your Content and share it, together with other identifying information, with law enforcement agencies.\nFinally, we could use your personal information for internal control to safeguard our and your safety, integrity and security.\nFor instance, in case of any suspicion of violations of our Terms of Services or the API Terms of Use.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improvement &amp.\ndevelopment</strong>: we evaluate the use of our Services to improve our Services, fix bugs, develop new products and services.\nWe do this either by market research (for instance by sending out surveys) or by performing analyses (for example by tracking and bringing together your personal information across our Services or across your mobile devices).\nWe do this in order to understand how our user base as a whole interacts with our Services, but also to review the effect of our advertisements and to improve those Services and advertisements accordingly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Marketing, advertisement &amp.\ncommunication</strong>: we use your personal information for marketing and (interest based) advertising for instance by using SDKs or cookies, as well as communication.\nThink updates on new Services, but also personalised advertisements of WeTransfer or our partners, which we can serve on our or third party websites.\nIn order to find the right audience for these advertisements we will look at certain segments of people.\nFor instance, people who use similar Services as ours, people who share the same characteristics as our current users or people within a certain geo-location, such as the Amsterdam area.\nIn order to connect with our target audience, we might use sequential messaging, which is basically a form of storytelling: each time you interact with our Services on a different device, you may receive a slightly different ad in a different form, but the ads are part of the same story.\nMoreover, based on the way you interact with our Services through your devices, we might promote one of our (other) Services or features.\nFinally, we enable you to engage in any (personalised) actions, promotions or events we offer.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal</strong>: in so far as necessary, we might use your personal information to defend WeTransfer in legal proceedings in relation to or as a result of your use of our Services, following a court order, abiding by any law, regulation or governmental request, cooperating with law enforcement, cooperating in fraud investigations of third parties, safeguarding national security, defense, public security, and to uphold our Terms of Services.</li>\n</ol> Legal grounds <p>Each processing activity has a valid legal ground, which is described below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Contractual obligations with you</strong>: regarding the activities and purposes mentioned under 1, 2 and 3.\nWe need to process personal information to offer our Services through our websites and mobile apps, to provide (technical) support and to bill your subscription fee.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal obligations</strong>: regarding the activities and purposes under 3, 4 and 7.\nWe\u2019re legally obliged to process your personal information for accounting purposes, to respond to legal requests and NTD- or DMCA-requests.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent</strong>: (partially) regarding activities and purposes mentioned under 2 (e.g.\naccessing your Content for support) and 6, except when we communicate direct marketing in relation to our own and similar Services to you as a paid user.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: (partially) regarding activities and purposes under 1 &amp.\n3 (e.g.\nto provide cross device access).\nFor the purposes mentioned under 4 in order to provide safe Services, to prevent fraud and react against illegal use of our Services.\nFor our innovative interests as mentioned under 5.\nAnd finally for our (direct) marketing, brand interests under 6 and legal &amp.\ncompliance interests as stated under 7.\nWhen we use your personal information based on our or a third party\u2019s legitimate interest, we will make sure to balance your rights and freedoms against said legitimate interest.\nIf, to the extent applicable, you wish to object to the activities based on our legitimate interest and there\u2019s no opt-out available in your account settings or received communication,

effect, you agree to pay the changed price.\nFee introductions will require your prior consent and registration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Depending on the payment method you choose, the issuer of the
