you will ensure that this information is kept accurate and up-to-date at all times.\nIf you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (e.g., in the event of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or use of your account ID or password), then you agree to immediately notify Khan Academy at khan.co/KA-support.\nYou may be liable for the losses incurred by Khan Academy or others due to any unauthorized use of your Services account.</li>\n<li>1.3 Integrated Service.\nKhan Academy may permit you to register for the Services through, or otherwise associate your Khan Academy account with, certain third party social networking or integrated services, such as Facebook Connect and Google (\"<b>Integrated Service</b>\").\nBy registering for the Services using (or

your school as provided in Section 1.6 (\"School Use\").\nIf you are under the age of 18, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to the Terms on your behalf.\nExcept for accounts created for School Use as provided in Section 1.6, a Child User that begins the registration process for himself or herself without a Parent User (as defined below) may have the registration process restricted until a parent approves or assumes responsibility for the Child User account.\nA Child User may use the Services if registered through certain educational organizations or, in certain cases, by School Personnel that have entered into a relationship directly with Khan Academy, so long as the education organization has obtained parent or guardian consent, or has complied with an exemption to parent consent requirements under applicable law.\nA Child User will only be permitted to use the Services for so long as Khan Academy reasonably believes that such access has been consented to by the Child User's parent or guardian, or by School Consent (as discussed in Section 1.6, \"School Use\").</li>\n<li>1.5 Parent User.\nIf you are at least 18 years of age and you are the legal parent or guardian of a child that seeks to register as a Child User of the Services, you may register a parent account on the Services (\"<b>Parent User</b>\").\nThrough a Parent User account, you may create, register, manage and approve Child User accounts only for your own child(ren) or child(ren) for whom you are a legal guardian.\nIF YOU REGISTER, APPROVE OR CONSENT

ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE BY THE CHILD USER.\nYou acknowledge that Khan Academy may choose, but is not obligated, to make any inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that Khan Academy deems necessary to validate your registration information, including without limitation engaging third parties to provide verification services.\nKhan Academy reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity.\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT KHAN ACADEMY CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ANY USER AND KHAN ACADEMY IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ANY USER, INCLUDING ANY USER'S CLAIM TO BE A PARENT USER, OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY A CHILD USER OR OTHER PARTY DURING REGISTRATION IS SUCH CHILD USER'S ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN.\nA Parent User account, along with all associated Child User accounts, may be terminated by Khan Academy at any time and without warning for any failure to abide by these Terms.</li>\n<li>1.6 School Use.\nKhan Academy may make available certain features and tools that permit Users registered as teachers, school leaders, aides, or other similar school personnel (\"<b>School Personnel</b>\") to work with students and other Users through the Services in order to provide such students with tutorial, educational and other education-related services as part of the school's curriculum, and to review and evaluate educational achievement and progress of such students.\nIf you are School Personnel accessing the Services on behalf of a school, school district, or other similar educational institution (an \"<b>Institution</b>\"), the following terms apply to you:<ol>\n<li>(a) Limitations on Use.\nThe Services and Website are provided to you for educational purposes as part of the school curriculum.\nYou must use the Services and the Website in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\nYou agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or otherwise exploit for any commercial purpose, any portion of the Services, the Website, or access to the Services or Website.</li>\n<li>(b) Responsibility for Consent and Notices.\nYou and/or the Institution assume sole responsibility for obtaining any consents required from parents or guardians, and for providing appropriate disclosures to School Users and their parents regarding the School Users' use of the Services, our Terms, and our Privacy Policy.\nYou agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of the School User, for so long as the School User account is not transferred to or assumed by a valid Parent User account or personal account for a Student of eligible age.\nIF YOU ARE SCHOOL PERSONNEL AND YOU REGISTER AN ACCOUNT FOR A CHILD USER OR OTHER STUDENT (EITHER, A \"<b>SCHOOL USER</b>\") OR DIRECT A SCHOOL USER TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT FOR SCHOOL USE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE EITHER RECEIVED EXPRESS CONSENT FROM SUCH SCHOOL USER'S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN OR THAT YOU (OR YOUR INSTITUTION) HAVE COMPLIED AND WILL COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS OF AN EXEMPTION FROM OR EXCEPTION TO PARENTAL CONSENT REQUIREMENTS, NECESSARY FOR YOU TO REGISTER THE SCHOOL USER FOR THE WEBSITE AND PROVIDE TO KHAN ACADEMY THE INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE REGISTRATION OF SUCH SCHOOL USER.\nSpecifically you agree, individually and on behalf of the Institution, that:<ol>\n<li>(i) You are familiar with and agree to be responsible for compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and the US Department of Education's implementing regulations at 34 CFR Part 99 (collectively, \"<b>FERPA</b>\"), and all other laws, rules or regulations concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information about Users in your Institution (collectively, \"<b>Applicable Privacy Law</b>\").</li>\n<li>(ii) You assume sole responsibility (and hereby agree that Khan Academy is not responsible for) for providing appropriate notices and disclosures to students using Khan Academy for classroom use (\"<b>Students</b>\" or \"<b>Student Users</b>\") and their parents regarding Student use of the Website, our Terms, and our Privacy Policy, including any notices required by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"<b>COPPA</b>\"), FERPA, or other Applicable Privacy Law.</li>\n<li>(iii) You assume sole responsibility (and hereby agree that Khan Academy is not responsible) for obtaining any consents required from parents or guardians, to the extent required under COPPA, FERPA or other Applicable Privacy Law, in connection with the Services, use of the Website for classroom use (including use of Linked Accounts referred to in Section 1.8), and disclosure of personally identifiable information to Khan Academy in connection therewith.\nYou represent and warrant to Khan Academy that, prior to creation of accounts for School Use, you have either obtained all necessary parent or guardian consents, or have complied and will comply with all applicable requirements of an exemption from or exception to parental consent requirements, including:<ol>\n<li>under FERPA, you have complied and will comply with the \"school official\" exception, or the \"directory information\" exception thereunder.\nand</li>\n<li>under COPPA, with respect to Students under the age of 13, you are acting as the agent of the parent and consenting on their behalf to the sharing of the Student's personal information.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>We refer to this a \"School Consent\".\nIf a Parent User does not consent or rescinds such School Consent, School Personnel or the Institution shall immediately notify Khan Academy to discontinue that Student's access to the Services and ensure that such Student's information is no longer accessible through the Services.\nUnder no circumstances will Khan Academy be liable for the School Personnel's failure to consult their school's authorities and administrators or for failing to obtain School Consent when required.</li>\n<li>(c) Identification of School Accounts.\nStudents and School Personnel may have personal accounts, in addition to accounts established for use in the classroom and associated with the Institution's use of the Services (\"<b>School Accounts</b>\").\nIf the Institution has a separate written service agreement with Khan Academy that includes rostering services for your Institution, accounts provided for classroom use will be School Accounts.\nIn other cases, in order for accounts established for use in the classroom to be designated as \"School Accounts,\" the accounts must be (1) created by School Personnel (for example, when a teacher creates the user name, login and password to establish School Accounts, or when the teacher rosters a class using Google Classroom, Clever, or similar Integrated Service (to the extent we support use of such Integrated Service)), or (2) created by a School User at the direction of a School, in each case, using a School email address and associated with a School's class on the Service.\nUser accounts created with a personal email address will not be considered School Accounts, and will be administered as personal accounts.\nIf you have questions about how to create School Accounts that are associated with a School's class on the Service, please contact our customer support team at khan.co/KA-support.</li>\n<li>(d) Use of Integrated Services in School Accounts.\nIf you are School Personnel and you choose to allow your students to log in on the Services using an Integrated Service, such as Google Classroom or Clever (to the extent we support use of such Integrated Service), you are responsible for educating your students on the proper use of Integrated Services and protecting their accounts.\nSee Section 1.3.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>1.7 Coaches.\nKhan Academy may make available certain features and tools that allow Users to add \"Coaches\" to their account.<ol>\n<li>(a) Coaching features are provided to allow any User to give another User, such as a tutor, friend or family member, the ability to view the activity in their Khan Academy account in order to provide them with tutoring or coaching help on Khan Academy.\nIn these Terms, we refer to any User that you connect to your Khan Academy account (other than School Personnel and Parent Users, who have different account permissions) as a \"<b>Coach</b>\".\nA Parent User associated with a Child User can disable the coaching feature upon account creation, or in the Child's User's account settings.</li>\n<li>(b) If you are a Coach, the following provisions apply to you.\nYou may use Khan Academy features and tools only for purposes of providing tutoring, coaching or other education-related assistance to a User that has an account established and existing pursuant to these Terms.\nCOACHES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO CREATE OR REGISTER ACCOUNTS FOR ANY OTHER USER.\nIn order to begin coaching relationship, the student or other User you wish to coach must either have a pre-existing account on the Services, or must establish an account pursuant to these Terms.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT REGISTRATION OF AN ACCOUNT BY OR FOR A CHILD USER REQUIRES CONSENT FROM SUCH USER'S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN.\nCOACHES MAY NOT PROVIDE THIS CONSENT DIRECTLY OR ON BEHALF OF THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN.\nYou must use the Services and the Website in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>1.8 Linked Accounts.\nKhan Academy may permit a User to associate a personal account with their School Account, by using the login credentials associated with a personal account to join a class or use the account for school-directed learning.\nIf a User chooses to associate a personal account with their School Account, the two accounts will be deemed \"Linked\" Accounts, and the User's learning activity (information regarding use of the Website generated by the User through use of the Website), whether generated during or outside of the school use, may be viewed by any person with access to either account.\n\"Linked\" Accounts are not separately functioning accounts.\nthey permit access to a singular Khan Academy account using more than one account interface or set of access credentials.\nLinked Accounts may benefit Students who want to use the Website for both personal and school purposes, by allowing School Personnel to have a deeper understanding of Student progress, and by allowing Users to keep track of all of their Khan Academy learning activity on an aggregate basis.\nThe User's election to enable account linking must be made, if at all, in connection with the initial account registration and rostering process for a given school year.\nOnce accounts are linked, they cannot be separated.\nKhan Academy may (but is not required to) enable linking of accounts as described herein.\nUpon any termination of the School Account by authorized School Personnel, the User's learning activity (including any learning activity from school use) will be retained in any Linked personal account.</li>\n<li>1.9 School Districts.\nKhan Academy may enter into supplemental written agreements with school districts with respect to use of the Services on a district-wide basis (\"<b>District Agreements</b>\").\nPursuant to District Agreements, we may provide additional services to school districts, and/or may provide additional undertakings to school districts with respect to the Services.\nExcept as otherwise provided in a District Agreement, these Terms remain in effect for all individual Users of the Services in the relevant district.</li>\n<li>1.10 Interational Use.\nKhan Academy operates the Services

Laws.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>2.\n<b>Privacy Policy</b>.\nYour privacy is important to Khan Academy.\nPlease read the Khan Academy Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated into these Terms (and which are part of our contract with you), carefully for information relating to Khan Academy's collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.\nAmong other things, our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal information and protect your privacy when you use our Services, and explains the procedures by which Users, Parent Users and School Personnel may view, update,

terms will be effective against you on the earlier of (i) your actual notice of such changes and (ii) thirty days after Khan Academy makes reasonable attempt to provide you such notice.\nHowever, changes addressing new functions for a service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.\nIf you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must discontinue your use of the Services.\nDisputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the version of the Terms in place at the time the dispute arose.</li>\n<li>4.2 School Accounts.\nThe following provisions apply to School Accounts in addition to the provisions set forth in Section 4.1 above.\nIf a change with respect to how personal information contained in education records is used or shared has a material adverse impact on Student Users or an Institution, and the Institution does not agree to the change, the Institution must notify Khan Academy within thirty days of receiving the notice of change as described under the \"Miscellaneous - Notices\" below.\nIf Khan Academy is notified as required, then the School Accounts held by that Institution will remain governed by the Terms in effect immediately prior to the change until the end of the end of the then current term of the Institution's written service agreement with Khan Academy, or, in the absence of such an agreement, the end of the current school term.\nIf the Services are renewed or continued after such time, they will be renewed or continued under Khan Academy's then-current

limitation any \"pop-up advertisements\".</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>(b) Use Characterization.\nWhether a particular use of the Licensed Educational Content is \"non-commercial\" depends on the use, not the user.\nThus, a use of the Licensed Educational Content that does not require that users pay fees and that does not provide an entity with a commercial advantage is \"non-commercial,\" even if this use is by a commercial entity.\nConversely, any use that involves charging users in connection with their access to the Licensed Educational Content is not \"non-commercial,\" even if this use is by a non-profit entity.\nAs an example, a for-profit corporation's use of the Licensed Educational Content for internal professional development or training of employees is permitted, so long as the corporation charges no fees, directly or indirectly, for such use.\nConversely, as another example, a non-profit entity's use of the Licensed Educational Content in connection with an fee-based training or educational program is NOT \"non-commercial\" and is not permitted.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>7.5 Crediting Khan Academy.\nIf you distribute, publicly perform or display, transmit, publish,

be effective only if in writing and signed by Khan Academy.</li>\n<li>15.3 Governing Law.\nThe Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without

CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\nBY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.<ol>\n<li>(a) Generally.\nIn order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, Khan Academy and you agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to your use of

arbitration.</li>\n<li>(c) Binding Arbitration.\nAny Dispute which has not been resolved by negotiation as provided herein within sixty (60) days or such time period as you and Khan Academy may otherwise agree, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section 15.4.\nYou are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all

Procedures (\"<b>JAMS Rules</b>\") in effect at the time the Dispute is filed.\nYou may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS Rules.\nIn a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.\nTo the extent the forum provided by JAMS is unavailable, Khan Academy and you agree to select a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution service shall apply the JAMS Rules.\nThe arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief to you only individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</li>\n<li>(f) Arbitration Fees.\nWhoever files the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee.\nIf Khan Academy files, then Khan Academy will pay.\nif you file, then you will pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules.\nEach party will bear the expense of that party's attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</li>\n<li>(g) Filing Period.\nTo the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under these Terms must be filed within one (1) year in an arbitration proceeding.\nThe one-year period begins when the events giving rise to the Dispute first occur.\nIf a Dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.</li>\n<li>(h) Venue.\nIn the event that any Dispute cannot be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 15.4, you agree that such Dispute will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for Santa Clara County, California, and each of you and Khan Academy hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such action.\nNotwithstanding this, Khan Academy shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>15.5 Severability.\nIf any provision of the Terms or any Guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from the Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</li>\n<li>15.6 Assignment.\nThe Terms and related Guidelines, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without Khan Academy's prior written consent, but may be assigned by Khan Academy without consent or any restriction.\nAny assignment attempted to be made in violation of the Terms shall be null and void.</li>\n<li>15.7 Survival.\nUpon termination of the Terms, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 2, 4 through 6, 7.1, 7.4, 7.5, and 8 through 15.</li>\n<li>15.8 Headings.\nThe heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of the Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.</li>\n<li>15.9 Entire Agreement.\nThe Terms, the Privacy Policy and Guidelines constitute the entire agreement between you and Khan Academy relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties, or by a change to the Terms, Privacy Policy or Guidelines made by Khan Academy as set forth in Section 4 above.</li>\n<li>15.10 Disclosures.\nThe Services are hosted in the United States, and the services provided hereunder are offered by Khan Academy: PO Box 1630, Mountain View, CA

embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.\nGovernment as a \"terrorist supporting\" country.\nand (ii) you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted

decisions around your information.</b>\n</p>\n<p>You can use many features of the Service without registering for an account or providing any other personal information.\nIf you create an account on the Khan Academy Service, or communicate with Khan Academy, you may provide to Khan Academy what is generally called \u201cPersonal Information\u201d or \u201cPersonal Data,\u201d such as your full name, birthdate, email address or other information that can be used to identify you.\nInformation which cannot be used to identify you as an individual is \u201cde-identified\u201d or non-personal information.</p>\n<p>We collect information, including personal information, in a variety of ways which may vary according to your use of the Service and your account settings.\nThe categories of personal information we collect may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact and profile information</li>\n<li>Account and authentication information from third-party integrated services</li>\n<li>Location information</li>\n<li>Information about your browser or device</li>\n<li>Donation and applicant data</li>\n<li>Non-personal information which may be linked to your Personal Information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below, we describe examples of the categories of information we collect from and about you when you use our Service:</p>Information you provide to us and information we receive about you from othersContact and profile information.<p>When you create an account on the Khan Academy Service, or communicate with us, we may collect personal information including your name, email address, and birthdate.\nAfter you register, you may also choose to provide additional information in your profile, such as your nickname, location (city), and other personal or demographic information.\nIn addition, we may ask you for personal information at other times, such as when you contact our technical support team, send us an email, complete a user survey, or otherwise communicate with Khan Academy.</p>Information from Integrated Sign-On Services.<p>If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party social networking or integrated service (what we call an \u201cIntegrated Service\u201d), such as Facebook, Google, Clever or similar single sign-on service, Khan Academy may also collect Personal Information that is already associated with your Integrated Service account.\nYou may also have the option of sharing additional information with Khan Academy through an Integrated Service, as controlled through your settings on that Integrated Service.\nIf you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, Khan Academy will treat the information as Personal Information and will use it in the ways described in this Privacy Policy.</p>Information obtained from other users.<p>We make available certain features on our Service that allow other users to provide us information about you.\nFor example, a parent or teacher may provide information relating to a Child User, such as when a parent registers an account for their Child and provide us with certain information about the Child, such as user name and age.</p>Information provided by partners and other sources.<p>We may also receive information from third party organizations with which we partner to provide educational services.\nIf we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Information that we collect through our Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>Information we collect to enable your participation in special programs or features.<p>From time to time, Khan Academy may feature a special program or activity we offer in partnership with a third party.\nIf you participate in these special programs, Khan Academy may collect personal information from you to facilitate those programs.\nFor example, LearnStorm participants may be asked to provide information related to event logistics and prize awarding and processing (e.g., contact information, dietary restrictions, shirt sizes, etc.), and College Board program participants may provide information regarding study habits and test scores (e.g., the number of hours studied, modules or tests taken, scores earned, etc.).</p>Information about how you access and use the ServiceInformation about your use of our Service.<p>We may collect usage information about your use of our Service, such as the number of problems you have attempted, the number of videos you have viewed, and the amount of time spent to complete a problem.\nThis enables us to better tailor educational experiences that are most appropriate for you.</p>Location information.<p>We may collect and use information about your location (such as your country) or infer your approximate location based on your IP address in order to provide you with tailored educational experiences for your region, but we don't collect the precise geolocation of you or your device.\nYou may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with any location information.</p>Other informationDonation and applicant information.<p>If you donate to Khan Academy via PayPal, we may obtain your name and mailing address to send a thank you note, or if you apply for a job with Khan Academy via an online recruiting site, we will obtain the information you provide in your application for that purpose.</p>Usage and device information.<p>To provide a personalized learning and high-quality experience for our users, we may use various technologies that automatically record certain technical information from your browser or device when you visit our website, read our emails, use our Service or otherwise engage with us.\nThis information is typically collected through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, Flash objects, log files,

carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, and whether you access the Service from multiple devices).\nWe may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Sites and to understand more about the demographics of our users.\nYou can learn more about

partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.\nAlthough we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time.</p>\n<p>We use or may use the data collected through tracking technologies to

display your preferred content the next time you visit.</li>\n<li>Customize the function and appearance of the pages you visit based on information relating to your account.\nfor example, in order to default you to a particular study level, or to remember customized settings for a report.</li>\n<li>Track website usage for various purposes including sales, marketing, and billing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nHowever, some features and services (particularly those that require you to sign-in) may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.\nYou may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of

Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5.\nYou can learn more about Flash objects - including how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies \u2013 on Adobe\u2019s website or by clicking here.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.\nPlease consult your browser\u2019s \u201cHelp\u201d function to learn more.\nIf you choose to delete Flash objects from our sites, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of the sites or benefit from the information and services offered.</p>\n<p>We and our third-party partners may also

information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided below.</p>3.\nHow we share or transfer data<p>Khan Academy takes great care to protect the information you provide us.\nWe do not rent or sell Personal Information that we collect from users with third parties.</p>\n<p>Khan Academy will disclose personal information when you post content which is visible to others on the Service, when you consent or instruct us to share your personal information with third parties, or when we have a legitimate business or legal need to share your information.\nWe may also disclose anonymous or aggregate information that does not reasonably identify you as an individual.\nTo learn more, see additional description below.</p>When information is visible to others on the Service by default.<p>Certain features and functions of the Service shares or makes your information accessible to others.\nAs with most online services, once you make your Personal Information available to others online, it may be collected and used by the recipients or any other website visitor without restriction.\nYou may wish to use a nickname or alias in your profile if you do not want your personal information shared with others in this way.\nFor example, your personal information may be visible to others in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Information you post to public spaces of the Service.</b> When you post a question or answer to the Service, your profile, which could include your name, short biography, and city-level location, as well as the content of your posted comment, is visible to others on the Service.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Connecting with a Coach.</b> When your account is connected to a Coach on the Service, the Coach will be able to see your profile information and your activities on the Service, such as which videos you have watched, the questions and responses you post, and other usage information.\nCoaches may also be able to see your name (not only your username) as well as your email address, if you include that information in your account profile.</li>\n</ul>With your consent or according to your instructions.<p>You may provide consent or authorization to share your personal information with third party applications or services in several ways.\nPlease note that these third parties are not governed by Khan Academy or the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nWe recommend you review the privacy policy of any third party application or service before authorizing access to your Khan Academy account information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>We may share data with social networks at your request.</b> Some of our users choose to connect their Khan Academy account with social networks.\nThis functionality is entirely optional.\nIf you have explicitly agreed that we may do so, Khan Academy may disclose your Personal Information through a social network or similar service (like Facebook or Google).\nTo control the information that you share, you have the option of modifying your Khan Academy or social network settings or disconnecting your social network account from your Khan Academy account.</li>\n<li>\n<b>We may share data with third-party applications that you authorize.</b> Third-party application developers and service providers (commonly known as \u201cApp Developers\u201d) may build complementary services for our platform, such as a mobile application for visually-impaired learners to access our resources, or may use our Khan Academy content to build unaffiliated applications and services.\nIf you connect your Khan Academy account to an application or service, or approve access to your Khan Academy account by a third party application or service, you consent to Khan Academy sharing your information with that third party.</li>\n<li>\n<b>We may share data in connection with special programs you participate in.</b> If you participate in special programs where Khan Academy partners with third parties, Khan Academy may share data collected from or about you with its third party partners to facilitate the program or services being offered.\nFor instance, if you participate in Khan Academy's program with College Board, Khan Academy may share information regarding your study habits, tests taken, and test scores with College Board.\nThese program partners may use your information we share with them as described in their own privacy policies.</li>\n<li>\n<b>We may share information with your consent.</b> Khan Academy does not share your Personal Information with third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent.\nIn some instances, you may be able to grant us permission to share your Personal Information with authorized partners, not-for-profit organizations, and other entities that are not affiliated with Khan Academy.\nIn these cases, we will only provide to these third parties the information you have authorized or asked us to share to these third parties.\nYou may also choose to share content with others by email, or by posting Khan Academy content to social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter.\nThese third parties may use your information as described in their own privacy policies.</li>\n</ul>We may share anonymous or aggregate data with others.<p>We may use data which has been de-identified and/or aggregated for product development, research, analytics and other purposes, including for the purpose of analyzing, improving, or marketing the Khan Academy Services.\nIn certain occasions, Khan Academy may share this data with business partners to improve our services or offerings.\nIf we disclose information to authorized business partners to conduct research on online education or assist in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, promotions, and/or functionality on our Service, such data will be aggregated and/or anonymized to reasonably avoid identification of a specific individual.</p>Other instances where we may share or disclose information for legal or business purposes.<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>We will share data with employees and service providers.</b> Khan Academy may share information with our employees and trusted vendors, third party service providers and other individuals to provide services or products for us or on our behalf, which could include analytics, hosting, marketing and similar services.\nWhen we share personal information with third party service providers or vendors, these third parties are contractually obligated to maintain the security and confidentiality of that personal information.</li>\n<li>\n<b>We may share data in the context of a change of business, including a merger or acquisition.</b> In the event that Khan Academy is involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, change of control, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, your personal information may be transferred or disclosed in connection with such business transaction.\nIf the transaction involves the transfer of Student Records to a third party, we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Privacy Policy, or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Records by deleting Student Records before the transfer occurs.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Other instances.</b> Khan Academy may release Personal Information if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.\n(b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof.\n(c) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations.\n(d) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.\n(e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Khan Academy, our users, or the public.\nor (f) as required or permitted by law.</li>\n</ul>4.\nMarketing and Sponsored ContentMessages from Khan Academy<p>We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services, or other third party products and services we think you may enjoy.\nFor example, if we partner with a not-for-profit organization running a contest in your region we may send you an email notifying you of the partnership or contest.\nWe will not share your information with the third party unless you opt-in to participate in the partnership or contest, and if so, the information we would share would be limited to that needed to facilitate your participation in the contest and enable you to redeem your prize.\nYou can unsubscribe from these mailings at any time.\nSee Section 6 below.</p>Sponsored Content<p>Khan Academy does not display any third party advertisements on the Service.\nFrom time to time, we permit third parties to sponsor content displayed on our Service.\nFor example, for-profit organizations may wish to sponsor all content related to a particular educational topic, such as astronomy or biology.\nSponsored content will always be labeled (e.g., \u201cSponsored by ___\u201d).\nKhan Academy does not share any of our users' Personal Information with these sponsors without explicit consent, and these sponsors do not have the ability to track or collect information about our site visitors or users.\nAs a non-profit organization, Khan Academy relies on our sponsors, donors, and other contributors to provide funding necessary to provide the free Service to our users.</p>\n<p>Please note: From time to time, we may display YouTube video content created by third parties and not by Khan Academy.\nWhile Khan Academy-created video content does not display video advertisements, third party content may include advertising which we cannot control.</p>5.\nThird Parties and Online AdvertisingInterest Based Advertising<p>Khan Academy does not display any targeted advertising on our Service.\nHowever, we participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements on other websites, apps or services, including on Facebook and other social networks, or on other devices you may use.\nThese third party ad networks use tracking technologies to recognize your browser or device and to collect information about your visit to our Service to provide you customized content, advertising and commercial messages which may be more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.</p>\n<p>Please note that we use our best efforts and take multiple steps to avoid the collection of information for targeted advertising purposes when we believe the Service is being used by students or children under 13.\nFor example, we take steps to inhibit these third party advertising networks from collecting information for targeted advertising purposes on webpages with child-directed content or when a student or child user logs into the Service.</p>\n<p>To learn about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the DAA's resources at

opt-out of some \u2013 but not all \u2013 interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.</p>\n<p>Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI's and DAA's online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices.\nYou must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.</p>YouTube<p>Khan Academy uses YouTube to display video content on the Service.\nYouTube incorporates tracking technologies, which may be present in the YouTube videos embedded on the Service, which may collect information from your browser when you view the video on the Service, including device identifiers and/or cookie IDs.\nThis information is collected directly and automatically by YouTube and its partners, and Khan Academy does not participate in these data transmissions.\nKhan Academy does not provide any Personal Information, such as user names, to YouTube.</p>\n<p>Khan Academy has taken steps to minimize this tracking activity, to the extent we have controls over a third-party's practices.\nWe have turned on \u201cPrivacy-Enhanced Mode\u201d for YouTube videos displayed on the Service.\nWe also utilize Google's \u201cchild-directed treatment\u201d tags to alert Google that these YouTube videos may be embedded on webpages visited by children or students.\nYou can learn more about Google\u2019s practices at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.\nYou may also be able to control ad tracking through YouTube by visiting the Google Ad Settings page, currently available at:

or where you have consented to our use of your Personal Information.\nWe take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we store and use is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.\nIf you discover that Personal Information or other data pertaining to you is inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date, please update your account information or contact us as outlined below.</p>You can choose to not provide us with Personal Information.<p>You may always decline to provide your Personal Information with Khan Academy.\nRegistration is not required to access most of our online resources.\nIf you decline to register, however, Khan Academy will not be able to provide to you certain features and functionalities found on our Service.\nYou may later enable or access those features by providing Khan Academy with the necessary Personal Information.</p>\n<p>You can chose to provide only information which does not reasonably identify you to others.\nWe recommend you select a username which is not related to your actual name, for example.\nYou can also decline to provide any optional data in your public profile.</p>You can disconnect us from Integrated Services.<p>You may revoke Khan Academy's access to your account on any Integrated Service, such as Google or Facebook, at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Integrated Service.\nYou should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service.\nPlease review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.</p>You can unsubscribe from email communications.<p>Khan Academy may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services, or products and services we think you may enjoy.\nOnly Khan Academy (or our vendors or service providers operating on our behalf) will send you these emails.\nYou can choose not to receive these emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in any e-mail or via your Settings page at https://www.khanacademy.org/settings/email.\nPlease note that you are not permitted to unsubscribe or opt-out of non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as account verification, changes or updates to features of the Service, or technical or security notices.</p>California Children's Privacy Rights<p>If you are under the age of 18 residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content or information you have posted publicly on our Service.\nTo delete your entire account and remove all of your information displayed publicly on the Service, log into your account and select \u201cdelete your account\u201d through

be able to identify the particular post you wish to be deleted or de-identified so that we can locate it on the Service.\nPlease note that removal of your content or information does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal, as there may be de-identified or recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some form.\nAdditionally, we will not remove content or information that we may be required to retain under applicable federal and state laws.</p>7.\nHow to access, update, or delete your personal informationHow to access or update your information.<p>We want you to have access to your information, so that you can help keep it as accurate as possible.\nIf you register and provide Khan Academy with Personal Information, you may update, correct, or

who request to modify or delete School User accounts may be directed to contact the School.</p>\n<p>Khan Academy will work with Schools to provide parents access to information in School User accounts at the request and direction of the School.\nIf you experience any difficulties in this process, please contact us as described below.</p>How to delete your information.<p>To request deletion of your personal information at any time, please log into your account and select \u201ddelete your account\u201c through Settings.\nYou can learn more in our Help Center, here.\nPlease note that your information will be retained in backup for up to one week.\nIf you log back into your account within 24 hours, your account will <u>not</u> be deleted and you will need to go through the deletion process again.</p>\n<p>We may not be able to delete data in all instances, such as information retained in technical support logs and other business records.\nWe will not be required to delete any information which has been de-identified or disassociated with personal identifiers such that it can no longer be used to reasonably identify a particular individual.</p>\n<p>Unless we receive a deletion request, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as is reasonably useful for operational purposes.\nFor example, we may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, for recordkeeping or other legitimate business purposes, or if required by law.\nWe may also retain information which has been de-identified or aggregated such that it can no longer reasonably identify a particular individual.\nAll retained personal information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>8.\nOur approach to Data SecurityData security is important to you, and to us.<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.\nFor example, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information to confirm your identity, and we may require that you create and use a password to access certain parts of our Service.\nYou should create and maintain a strong password to help ensure the security of your account.</p>We try to ensure that our Service and information sent to us are safe, but no security measures are perfect.<p>Khan Academy uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information and other information we maintain in connection with our Service.\nWe cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the information you transmit to Khan Academy, and you do so at your own risk.\nOnce we receive your transmission of information, Khan Academy makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.\nWhen you enter sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies.\nHowever, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.\nIn the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and will notify you of the security incident in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>9.\nSchool Users and Student Records<p>Khan Academy is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free, educational content.\nWe strive to implement best practices to protect the privacy of all of our student and non-student users, alike.\nTo help our School partners address their obligations to protect their students' data privacy, we have implemented additional controls and procedures for schools, school districts and teachers (collectively referred to as \u201c<b>Schools</b>\u201d) when they enter into a contract with Khan Academy to use the Service as part of the School's educational curriculum.\nWhen the Service is used as part of the School's educational curriculum, the personal information related to the School's student users (\u201c<b>School Users</b>\u201d) that is (i) provided to Khan Academy by a student or by a School, or (ii) collected by Khan Academy during the provision of the Service to a School, may include information defined as \u201ceducational records\u201d by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201c<b>FERPA</b>\u201d) or other information protected by similar student data privacy laws.\nWe call this information \u201c<b>Student Records.</b>\u201d</p>\n<p>Please note, because many of our user accounts are used for both School and non-School purposes, only personal information relating to user accounts which are (1) created by a School (for example, when a teacher creates the user name, login and password to establish School User accounts, or when the teacher rosters a class using Google Classroom, Clever, or similar single sign-on service), or (2) created by a School User at the direction of a School, using a School email address and associated with a School's class on the Service, and (3) created pursuant to a contract between Khan Academy and the School, are designated as Student Records on Khan Academy.\nStudent Records shall not include information a student or other individual may provide to Khan Academy independent of the student's use of the Service at the direction of the School.\nFor example, if a user connects her existing Khan Academy account (i.e., an account associated with a non-School email address and created outside of her use of the Service for the School's purposes) to a School\u2019s class on the Service, the personal information and profile data associated with the account shall not be considered Student Records.\nIf you are a School, please contact us at schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org to learn more about how to create School User accounts which may hold Student Records.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Our commitment:</b> We are proud supporters of the Student Privacy Pledge.\nOur collection and use of Student Records is governed by our contracts with the Schools, by our Privacy Policy, and by applicable privacy laws.\nFor example, we work with Schools to help protect personal information from the Student\u2019s educational record, as required by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201c<b>FERPA</b>\u201d), and to protect the personal information of students under 13 consistent with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201c<b>COPPA</b>\u201d).\nIf you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting the personal information of a School User accessing the Service through a School partner agreement, please contact your School directly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We collect, maintain, use and share Student Records only for an authorized educational and as described in our Privacy Policy, or as directed by the School, the School User and/or the student's parent or legal guardian (a \u201c<b>Parent</b>\u201d).</li>\n<li>We do not disclose Student Records for targeted advertising purposes.\nWhile we do permit third party advertising partners to operate on our Service for the purpose of retargeting, analytics and attribution services, we disable third party ad networks when a School User logs into a School User account on the Service.</li>\n<li>We do not build a personal profile of a School User other than in furtherance of an educational purpose or as authorized by a Parent.</li>\n<li>We maintain a comprehensive data security program designed to protect the types of Student Records maintained by the Service.</li>\n<li>We will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices to our users.</li>\n<li>We will never sell Student Records unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Privacy Policy or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Records by deleting the Student Records before the transfer occurs.</li>\n<li>We will not make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or contractual agreements that relate to the collection or use of Student Records without first giving notice to the School and providing a choice before the Student Records are used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.</li>\n</ul>How we share and disclose Student Records.<p>We disclose Student Records in the manner described in our Privacy Policy under Section entitled How We Share and Disclose Information.\nDepending on the features and account controls applicable to the School User accounts, we may share usernames and profile information with other users on the Service, such as teachers, coaches, or School administrators, and this information may be visible if a School User posts content in the discussion forums.</p>\n<p>Depending on the manner in which Khan Academy is used by a School and the terms of the agreement between the School and Khan Academy, Khan Academy may provide access to certain Student Records, School User account usage data (\u201c<b>School Analytics</b>\u201d) and Teacher User account usage data to the School for the purpose of monitoring student usage and activity and evaluating the effectiveness of the School's use of the Khan Academy service.\nIn some circumstances, School Analytics may only be available for Student accounts using a School email address or login and which are associated with a School\u2019s teacher or coach.</p>How we retain and delete Student Records.<p>We will not knowingly retain Student Records beyond the time period required to support an educational purpose, unless authorized by a School, student or parent.\nMany of our users continue to use their accounts for a personal, non-School purpose and may associate their accounts with the account of their Parent.\nIn such cases, the user (or the user's Parent) shall be responsible for account deletion requests.</p>\n<p>All users, including School Users (or their Parents) can delete their accounts and all personal information associated with the account at any time through account Settings.\nSee \u201cHow can I cancel or delete my account\u201d in the Khan Academy Help Center for instructions.</p>\n<p>The School is responsible for managing Student Records which the School no longer needs for an educational purpose by submitting a deletion request when such data is no longer needed.\nSchools should contact us at schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org to request deletion of Student Records associated with the School's use of Khan Academy.\nPlease note that Khan Academy cannot comply with a School's request to delete personal information in a user account except for School User accounts created by a School (i.e., using a School email address and/or an account login provided by a School) pursuant to a contractual agreement between the School and Khan Academy, or unless the user (or the user's Parent) requests deletion directly.\nWe will also not be able to delete information associated with School User accounts that the School User has associated with a personal account.</p>Questions about Student Records.<p>If you have questions about specific practices relating to Student Records provided to Khan Academy by a School, please direct your questions to your School.</p>10.\nHow does Khan Academy protect Children's privacy?<p>Khan Academy does not permit children under the age of 13 (a \u201cChild\u201d or \u201cChildren\u201d) to create an account without the consent and at the direction of a Parent or School.\nPlease contact us at privacy@khanacademy.org if you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 without parental consent so that we may delete the information as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Children under 13 may create an account with the parent's consent.\nPlease see the <b>Children's Privacy Policy</b> to learn more about how Khan Academy collects, uses and shares information associated with Child accounts.</p>\n<p>When Khan Academy is used by a School in an educational setting, we may rely on the School to provide the requisite consent for Khan Academy to collect information from a School User under the age of 13, in lieu of parental consent.</p>11.\nInternational Visitors<p>Our Service is operated and managed on servers located within the United

Academy is committed to children\u2019s privacy.<p>Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to Khan Academy.\nFor that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect personal information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age (\u201c<b>Child Users</b>\u201d).\nKhan Academy does not knowingly permit Child Users to register directly for our Service without consent of a Parent or School.\nIf Khan Academy learns that Personal Information of a Child User has been collected on our Service without parental consent, then Khan Academy will take appropriate steps to delete this information.\nIf you are a parent or guardian (\u201c<b>Parent</b>\u201d) and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with our Service without your consent, please alert Khan Academy at privacy@khanacademy.org and request that we delete that child\u2019s personal information from our systems.</p>How children may register for and use our Service.<p>Child Users can sign up for a Khan Academy account several ways.</p>1.\nWhen a Child User signs up for a Khan Academy Account we request Parental consent.<p>When a Child User registers for our Service, we request a birthdate, username, password, and a parent's email address so that we can email the Child User's Parent in order to seek consent for the Child to use the Service.\nKhan Academy does not ask the Child User for any more information than is necessary to provide the Service to the Child User or to seek parental consent.\nThe Child User is permitted to use the Service for seven (7) days through a Restricted Account (see below) while we notify the Parent for consent.\nIf we do not receive Parental consent within 7 days, the Child User's Restricted Account is closed, and the Child's personal information is deleted from our systems.</p>2.\nWhen a Child User account is created by a School, the School may provide consent.<p>When the Khan Academy Service is used by a teacher, school, or district (a \u201c<b>School</b>\u201d) in the classroom for an educational purpose, we permit the School to create Child User accounts and to provide the requisite consent for Khan Academy to collect personal information of a Child User for this purpose, in lieu of parental consent.\nSchools may create a Child User account by adding students to the Service through Google Classroom, Clever, or similar single sign-on service, or through a school integration mechanism, or a School may create logins/passwords for each individual student.\nWhen Schools create accounts in this manner, we do not request additional consent from the Parent.\nHowever, when a School or other individual invites a Child User to join the Service and connect to a teacher or coach's class using a class code, we request parental consent in the manner described below.</p>Methods for providing Parental consent.<p>Parents may provide consent for a Child User to use the Service through a Restricted Account (explained below) by responding affirmatively to an email sent by Khan Academy to the Parent's email address provided by the Child User during registration.\nIf we do not receive consent from the Parent within seven (7) days, the Child User's account will be closed and the Child's personal information is deleted from our systems.\nRestricted Accounts may access and use certain features of the Service in a limited manner.</p>\n<p>To enable additional functionality for the Child User account and to enable full access and control over the Child User's account activity, the Parent must create a Parent Account on the Service and connect to the Child User's account by clicking on the account creation link in the Parental consent notice.\nParent Accounts control the settings and functionality of the Child account.\nThe Parent can maintain the Child's Restricted Account, and/or can enable additional functionality and data sharing features, if desired.\nParents can revoke a Child User's permissions to use the Service at any time by deleting the account.</p>4.\nRestricted Accounts for Child Users.<p>Khan Academy attempts to restrict a Child User's access to certain features that could result in disclosure of the Child's personal information.\nA Restricted Account limits sharing and displaying private information about the Child User in various ways.</p>\n<p>For example, a Child User with a Restricted Account cannot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>display personal information other than a username.\nRestricted Accounts contain the Child's username and do not include other personal information or profile data.\nBecause the username may be displayed on the Service, we strongly recommend selecting a username which does not relate to or identify the real name of the Child.\nThe Child username can be selected or revised by the Parent by creating a Parent Account.</li>\n<li>add or edit personal information associated with a Restricted Account</li>\n<li>post to public discussion forums, or post questions or answers on lessons</li>\n<li>see or access links to third-party sites on the Service</li>\n<li>receive emails from Khan Academy (all emails are sent to the Parent email on file)</li>\n<li>communicate with or share personal information with Coaches other than a username and Service usage activity (i.e., lessons completed, badges earned, etc.).\nSimilarly, Coaches cannot communicate with a Child User with a Restricted Account except to assign content for the Child User to view through the class.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A Parent who creates a Parent Account can manage and control additional features and functionality.\nFor example, Parents can create or revise a Child's username.\nadd or revise profile information.\nrestrict or enable the Child User to add a Coach using a class code.\nPlease see \u201cHow are child accounts different from regular accounts\u201d in the Help Center to learn more.</p>5.\nWhat information do we collect from a Child User?<p>We collect a username, birthdate, and Parent's email address when a Child User registers for the Service, as well as any other personal information a Parent adds to a Child User's account, as described above.\nWe collect information about the Child User's use of the Service (lessons completed, badges earned) as well as content the Child posts to the Service if such functionality is enabled by the Parent.\nWe also collect usage and device information, as described in our Privacy Policy.\nWe use this information to provide the Service to the Child User and for the purposes described in in our Privacy Policy's section \u201cHow we use the information we collect.\u201d We use the Parent's email address to communicate messages about the account.</p>6.\nHow do we disclose information relating to a Child User?<p>As described above, Restricted Accounts have limited data sharing capabilities.\nA username and progress information, along with any personal information the Parent added to the Child's profile, is shared with a Coach or teacher added to the Child User's account, though a Parent Account may restrict the Child User from adding Coaches to the account.\nParents may also enable additional data sharing features through a Parent Account, for example, by adding profile information and permitting the profile to be shared with Coaches and other users, or enabling the Child User to post content (e.g., questions and answers) to the Service.\nParents that enable content-posting features should be aware that a Child User could post personally identifiable information in free-form content on the Service, and should monitor the Child User's posts and delete personal information if needed.\nWe may also disclose personal information of Child Users for business purposes, as described in the Privacy Policy section \u201cOther instances where we may share or disclose information for legal or business purposes.\u201d</p>7.\nThird party tracking and online advertising.<p>Khan Academy does not display any targeted advertising on the Service.\nWe do not disclose personal information of Child Users for direct marketing purposes or for targeted advertising purposes.\nWhile we do permit third party advertising partners to operate on our Service for the purpose of retargeting, analytics and attribution services (See our Privacy Policy section \u201cThird Parties and Online Advertising\u201d), we take steps to disable third party ad networks on webpages with child-directed content or when a Child User logs into a Restricted Account on the Service.</p>YouTube<p>Khan Academy uses YouTube to display video content on the Service.\nYouTube incorporates tracking technologies, which may be present in the YouTube videos embedded on the Service, which may collect information from your browser when you view the video on the Service, including device identifiers and/or cookie IDs.\nThis information is collected directly and automatically by YouTube and its partners, and Khan Academy does not participate in these data transmissions.\nKhan Academy does not provide any personal information, such as usernames, to YouTube.</p>\n<p>Khan Academy has taken steps to minimize this tracking activity, to the extent we have controls over a third-party's practices.\nWe have turned on \u201cPrivacy-Enhanced Mode\u201d for YouTube videos displayed on the Service.\nWe also utilize Google's \u201cchild-directed treatment\u201d tags to alert Google that these YouTube videos may be embedded on webpages visited by children under the age of 13.\nYou can learn more about Google's practices at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.\nYou may also be able to control ad tracking through YouTube by visiting the Google Ad Settings page, currently available at: https://adssettings.google.com.</p>8.\nHow to access, modify and delete your Child's personal information.<p>As a Parent, you have the ability to access control information about your Child User in the \u201cYour Children\u201d section of your Parent Account.\nTo refuse future collection or use of your child's Personal Information, you can delete your Child User's Account by following the instructions in our FAQ.\nPlease note, you must delete your Child User\u2019s account <u>\n<i>before</i>\n</u> you delete the Parent Account.</p>\n<p>If you do not have a Parent Account associated with your Child User's Restricted Account, you may contact us at http://khan.co/KA-support to access or delete the Child User's account.\nPlease note you will need the Child User's username, and we may take steps to authenticate your identity before we can provide access to the Restricted Account.</p>", "created_at":
