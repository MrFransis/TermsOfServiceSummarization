Rights</strong>.\nCalifornia residents may exercise the California privacy rights described above as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Rights to information, access, and deletion</em>\n</strong>&nbsp.\nTo request to exercise your information, access or deletion rights: <ul>\n<li>Complete the <strong>\u201cSubmit a CCPA Data Request\u201d </strong>form available in our <strong>online Help Center</strong>.</li>\n<li>Email <strong>privacy@theatlantic.com</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Call us toll free: <strong>1-855-940-0585</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Identity verification for CCPA rights to information, access, and deletion.</em>\n</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>We reserve the right to confirm your California residence to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise your CCPA rights.</li>\n<li>Following California law, we take reasonable precautions to verify the identities of those California residents submitting requests to delete or access Personal Information, or to learn more about how their Personal Information is processed.\nFor requests to access specific pieces of Personal Information, we verify the requester\u2019s identity by having them first complete a notarized affidavit affirming their identity and California residency.\nWhen a notarized affidavit cannot be obtained, we may request alternate forms of identification, such as by authenticating one\u2019s identity through their account on our site or, only when necessary and only as permissible under applicable law, by providing a copy of a government identification card.</li>\n<li>For CCPA deletion requests and requests to learn more about how their Personal Information is processed, we verify the requester\u2019s identity by asking them to confirm their request by email.</li>\n<li>We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to verify your identity, understand the nature of the request, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Right to opt-out of the \u201csale\u201d of your Personal Information</em>\n</strong>: The Atlantic does not sell your Personal Information in the conventional sense (i.e., for money)&nbsp.\nLike many companies, however, we use services that help deliver interest-based ads to you and may transfer Personal Information to business partners for their use.\nMaking Personal Information (such as online identifiers or browsing activity) available to these companies may be considered a \u201csale\u201d under the CCPA.&nbsp.\nYou can request to opt out of such \u201csale\u201d of your Personal Information here: <strong>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</strong>&nbsp.\nPlease note that you will still see some advertising, regardless of your selection.\nWe do not impose verification protocols for processing California residents\u2019 requests to opt out of the \u201csale\u201d of their Personal Information, unless we have reason to question the authenticity of a requester\u2019s identity, in which case we may request a notarized affidavit affirming their identity and California residency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Authorized Agents.\n</strong>California residents can empower an \u201cauthorized agent\u201d to submit CCPA requests on their behalf through the same means outlined above through which a California resident may file a request \u2013 through our online Help Center, by emailing us at privacy@theatlantic.com, or by calling our toll free number.\nUnless the California resident has provided the authorized agent power of attorney, we will also require the following before processing a request submitted via an authorized agent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Signed authorization from the California resident permitting the authorized agent to submit CCPA requests on their behalf;</li>\n<li>Proof of the California resident\u2019s identity sufficient to satisfy our respective verification protocols that otherwise apply to CCPA requests to delete Personal Information, access Personal Information, learn more about how Personal Information is processed, or to opt out of the \u201csale\u201d of Personal Information.\nand</li>\n<li>Direct confirmation sent from the consumer to us (without the authorized agent as an intermediary) affirming that the agent is authorized to act on their behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Notice Regarding B2B Sites.\n</strong>Three of our websites, www.Atlantic57.com, www.atlanticbrandpartners.com, and advertising.theatlantic.com (the \u201cB2B Sites\u201d), are designed solely for business use and not intended for personal or household

\u201csell\u201d any information collected from your use of the B2B Sites, as that term is defined by the CCPA.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Notice Regarding California Residents We Know to Be Under the Age of 16.\n</b>California residents we know to be younger than 16 years of age will by default be treated as though they have exercised a request to opt out of the sale of their Personal Information with respect to information provided directly to us (as opposed to information automatically collected from them through technical means).\nWe do not permit such users to opt-in to the sale of their Personal Information, unless they provide proof that they are no longer under the age of 16.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\n<u>USERS IN THE EEA, UK, AND SWITZERLAND</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>If

of your own information.\nYou must take precautions to protect the security of any personal information that you may transmit over any home networks, wireless routers, wireless (WiFi) networks or similar devices by using encryption and other techniques to prevent unauthorized persons from intercepting or receiving any of your personal information.\nYou are responsible for the security of your information when using unencrypted, open access or otherwise unsecured networks.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How Long Your Information Is Stored&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The time period for which we keep information varies according to the purpose for which it is used for.\nIn some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period.\nUnless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Emails and
