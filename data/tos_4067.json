information for specified purposes and shall not keep such personal information longer than is necessary to fulfil these purposes.\nThe following are examples of such purposes.\nWe have also indicated below which GDPR justification applies, however it will depend on the circumstances of each case.\nAt the time of collecting we will provide further information, and you may always ask for further information from us.\n<ol>\n<li>To help us to identify you when you contact us.\nThis will normally be necessary for the performance our contract.</li>\n<li>To help us to identify accounts, services and/or products which you could have from us or selected partners from time to time.\nWe may do this by automatic means using a scoring system, which uses the personal information you\u2019ve provided and/or any information we hold about you and personal information from third party agencies (including credit reference agencies).\nWe will only use your information for this purpose if you agree to it.</li>\n<li>To help us to administer and to contact you about improved administration of any accounts, services and products we have provided before, do provide now or will or may provide in the future.\nThis will often be necessary, but sometimes the improvements will not be necessary in which case we will ask whether you agree.</li>\n<li>To allow us to carry out marketing analysis and customer profiling (including with transactional information), conduct research, including creating statistical and testing information.\nThis will sometimes require that you consent, but will sometimes be exempt as market research.</li>\n<li>To help to prevent and detect fraud or loss.\nThis will only be done in certain circumstances when we consider it necessary or the law requires it.</li>\n<li>To allow us to contact you by written electronic means (such as email, text or multimedia messages) about products and services offered by us where:\n<ol>\n<li>these products are similar to those you have already purchased from us,</li>\n<li>you were given the opportunity to opt out of being contacted by us at the time your personal information was originally collected by us and at the time of our subsequent communications with you, and</li>\n<li>you have not opted out of us contacting you.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>To allow us to contact you in any way (including mail, email, telephone, visit, text or multimedia messages) about products and services offered by us and selected partners where you have expressly consented to us doing so.</li>\n<li>We may monitor and record communications with you (including phone conversations and emails) for quality assurance and compliance.\n<ol>\n<li>Before doing that, we will always tell you of our intentions and of the specific purpose in making the recording.\nSometimes such recordings will be necessary to comply with the law.\nAlternatively, sometimes the recording will be necessary for our legitimate interest, but in that case we\u2019ll only record the call if our interest outweighs yours.\nThis will depend on all the circumstances, in particular the importance of the information and whether we can obtain the information another way that\u2019s less intrusive.</li>\n<li>If we think the recording would be useful for us but that it\u2019s not necessary we\u2019ll ask whether you consent to the recording, and will provide an option for you to tell us that you consent.\nIn those situations, if you don\u2019t consent, the call will either automatically end or will not be recorded.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>When it\u2019s required by law, we\u2019ll check your details with fraud prevention agencies.\nIf you provide false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we intend to record this.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>We will not disclose your personal information to any third party except in accordance with this Notice, and in particular in these circumstances:\n<ol>\n<li>They will be processing the data on our behalf as a data processor (where we\u2019ll be the data controller).\nIn that situation, we\u2019ll always have a contract with the data processor as set out in the GDPR.\nThis contract provides significant restrictions as to how the data processor operates so that you can be confident your data is protected to the same degree as provided in this Notice.</li>\n<li>Sometimes it might be necessary to share data with another data controller.\nBefore doing that we\u2019ll always tell you.\nNote that if we receive information about you from a third party, then as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards we\u2019ll let you know.\nthat\u2019s required by the GDPR.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, sometimes we might consider it to be in your interest to send your information to a third party.\nIf that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll always ask whether you agree before sending.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Where you give us personal information on behalf of someone else, you confirm that you have provided them with the information set out in this Notice and that they have not objected to such use of their personal information.</li>\n<li>We may allow other people and organisations to use personal information we hold about you in the following circumstances:\n<ol>\n<li>If we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired or are in the process of being acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us, about our customers, will be one of the transferred assets.</li>\n<li>If we have been legitimately asked to provide information for legal or regulatory purposes or as part of legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings.</li>\n<li>We may employ companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf and we may disclose your personal information to these parties for the purposes set out above, for example, for fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links) and providing customer service.\nThose parties will be bound by strict contractual provisions with us and will only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and they may not use it for any other purpose.\nFurther, they must process the personal information in accordance with this Notice and as permitted by the GDPR.\nFrom time to time, these other people and organisations to whom we may pass your personal information may be outside the European Economic Area.\nWe will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Notice and the GDPR.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Protecting information</b>\n<ol>\n<li>We have strict security measures to protect personal information.</li>\n<li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software to encrypt information you input.</li>\n<li>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.\nOf course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</li>\n<li>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information.\nOur security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.</li>\n<li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer.\nBe sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>The internet</b>\n<ol>\n<li>If you communicate with us using the internet, we may occasionally email you about our services and products.\nWhen you first give us personal information through the Website, we will normally give you the opportunity to say whether you would prefer that &nbsp;we don\u2019t contact you by email.\nYou can also always send us an email (at the address set out below) at any time if you change your mind.</li>\n<li>Please remember that communications over the internet, such as emails and webmails (messages sent through a website), are not secure unless they have been encrypted.\nYour communications may go through a number of countries before they are delivered \u2013 this is the nature of the internet.\nWe cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Cookies and other internet tracking technology</b>\n<ol>\n<li>When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable.\nThis sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your computer, which is sent back to us at a later time.\nThese are called \u2018cookies\u2019.\nThese cookies are listed in the table at clause 8.5.\nSome websites don\u2019t use cookies but use related technology for gaining information about website users such as JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalise advertising content.\nMultiple cookies may be found in a single file depending on which browser you use.</li>\n<li>Where applicable, this section of the Notice also relates to that technology but the term \u2018cookie\u2019 is used throughout.</li>\n<li>Some of these cookies are essential to services you\u2019ve requested from us, whereas others are used to improve services for you, for example through:\n<ol>\n<li>Letting you navigate between pages efficiently</li>\n<li>Enabling a service to recognise your computer so you don\u2019t have to give the same information during one task</li>\n<li>Recognising that you have already given a username and password so you don\u2019t need to enter it for every web page requested</li>\n<li>Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and that there is enough capacity to ensure they are fast</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>To learn more

which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages.\nThis information is only used to improve how a website works.\nCategory 3\nFunctionality\nThese cookies allow the

local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located.\nThese cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise.\nThey may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as a live chat session.\nCategory 4\nTargeting and advertising\nThese cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests.\nThey are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.\nThey are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator\u2019s permission.\nThey remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers.\nQuite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.\n<ol>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>As with any other
