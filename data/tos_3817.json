(including reasonable legal and accounting fees) arising from or related to your use of the Site, including the Content, or your breach of these Terms.\nFood Lion reserves the right to assume or participate, at your expense, in the investigation, settlement and defense of any such action or claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>26.\nGoverning Law</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms are governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the substantive laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>27.\nArbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A.\n<strong>Mandatory Arbitration</strong>.\nYOU AND FOOD LION AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE (each, a \"<strong>Dispute</strong>\") to binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), which shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement (\"<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>\").\nYou and Food Lion waive the right to a trial by jury and any right to have a Dispute heard in court.</p>\n<p>In arbitration, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the arbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts.\nThe arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief.\nJudgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nA single arbitrator with the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") will conduct the arbitration, and the award may not exceed the relief allowed by applicable law.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the county of your residence or another mutually agreed location.\nThe AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply.\nIf AAA will not apply those rules, then AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.\nThe AAA's rules and a form that can be used to initiate arbitration proceedings are available at http://www.adr.org.\nYou and Food Lion agree that if for any reason AAA will not conduct or becomes unavailable to conduct the arbitration, then a court may appoint a substitute arbitrator, and further agree that the choice of AAA as a forum is not integral to the Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will decide all issues relating to the enforceability, interpretation, scope, and application of this Arbitration Agreement (including \u201cgateway\u201d issues of arbitrability, whether the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration), and these Terms, except that a court will resolve any question regarding the validity or enforceability of the class action waiver set forth in Section B of this Arbitration Agreement.\nThe term \"Dispute\" and the requirement to arbitrate will be broadly interpreted.</p>\n<p>B.\n<strong>Arbitration Class Action Waiver</strong>.\nYou and Food Lion agree that the arbitration will be conducted solely on an individual basis and not on a class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general basis.\nA Dispute may not be consolidated with a claim brought or discovery by any person or entity that is not a party to the arbitration proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may not award relief to any person or entity other than a party to the arbitration proceeding and may only award such relief as is necessary to provide relief to a party to the arbitration proceeding.\nIf a court deems any portion of this Section B invalid or unenforceable, then Sections A and C of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void.</p>\n<p>C.\n<strong>Fees and Costs in Arbitration</strong>.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.\nFood Lion will reimburse you for those fees up to $7,500, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, Food Lion will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>\n<p>D.\n<strong>Non-Arbitration Class Action and Jury Waiver</strong>.\nYou and Food Lion agree that if for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration: (1) you and Food Lion waive any right to a jury trial.\n(2) the Dispute will proceed solely on an individual, non-class, non-representative basis.\nand (3) neither you nor Food Lion may be a class representative or class member or otherwise participate in any class, representative, consolidated, or private attorney general proceeding.</p>\n<p>E.\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS SECTION, YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE EARLIER OF: (1) THE DATE YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS, OR (2) THE DATE YOU FIRST AGREED OR ASSENTED TO AN AGREEMENT WITH FOOD LION THAT CONTAINED AN ARBITRATION PROVISION.\nThe opt-out notice must be sent no later than the applicable deadline and emailed to: privacy@foodlion.com and optout@foodlion.com.\nThe opt-out notice must state that you do not agree to this Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone number and email address.\nThis procedure is the only way you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and failure to comply strictly with this procedure and the applicable deadline automatically will render the opt-out notice null and void.\nIf you opt out of the arbitration provision, all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>28.\nExport Control</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Food Lion controls and operates the Site from the United States and does not claim that any part of the Site is appropriate or may be accessed or used outside of the United States.\nAccess to the Site may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries.\nIf you access the Site from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for

supporting\" country.\n(b) listed on any U.S.\ngovernment lists of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>29.\nGeneral</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.\nNo waiver of any provision in these Terms shall be a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision in these Terms.\nThe section names in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nYou may not assign these Terms, or any of your rights or obligations hereunder, without the prior written consent of Food Lion.\nWe may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all our rights or obligations under these Terms at any time without your prior consent.\nExcept as expressly provided elsewhere in the Site, these Terms and any other terms and conditions expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms by Food Lion constitute the entire agreement between you and Food Lion with respect to your use of the
