clauses below that do not apply to your use of our website or services.\n</p> 1.\nOur Policy\u2019s Aims\n<p>1.1\tThe Avast Privacy Policy applies to AVAST Software s.r.o.\n(\"Avast\") and unless specified, its subsidiaries, including AVG, Piriform (CCleaner), Privax Ltd (HideMyAss!), Norman, TuneUp, Location Labs Inc and Jumpshot Inc, contractors, representatives, agents, and resellers while they are working on our behalf (collectively \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d).</p>\n<p>1.2\tOur Privacy Policy explains the processing of your personal data by us and establishes what information we collect, or which is provided to us, and how we use and protect your personal data in compliance with applicable law.</p>\n<p>1.3\tPersonal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d), where this identification can be made directly or indirectly, by means of identifiers such as your name, identification number, email address, phone number, online identifiers such as cookies in some circumstances, your location, your genetic, economic, cultural or social identity or other information that is specific to you.\n</p>\n<p>1.4\tWe do not mean information that only refers to a business corporation or organization.\nWe also do not mean information that has been \"anonymized,\" either by removing or de-identifying all specific identifiers.\nAnonymous data is not personal data when the anonymization is irreversible.\nWhen we refer to anonymous data, we mean data that cannot be reversed into personal data.</p>\n<p>1.5\tAs a data controller, we commit ourselves to protecting the privacy of our website visitors and users of our products and services with respect to the processing of your personal data.\n</p>\n<p>Where we collect and process your personal data, we will limit the collection and retention to what is adequate, relevant and necessary for our purposes and it will be kept in a form which allows for your identification no longer than necessary for the purpose for which we process your personal data.\nWe refer to this as data minimisation.\n</p>\n<p>1.7\tWhere we store your personal data for longer periods for statistical purposes, as permitted, we will use appropriate safeguards.\nApplicable law defines \u2018statistical purpose\u2019 as any collection of personal data, where the result of processing is for aggregate data, so the personal data we collect from you is anonymized or pseudonymized.\nFor example, the processing of your personal data may be for the business-related process of counting users, products, sales and various metrics.\nWe also share statistical data that has been anonymized and aggregated geographically and so, cannot be used to identify individuals, with third parties for trend analytics.\n</p>\n<p>1.8\tOur policy provides you with the legal bases for the collection of your personal data, lets you know how long personal data is stored and the reasons why, and how in some circumstances, they are necessary to retain.\nThe length of this retention and how you may choose to request that we delete some or all your personal data and the consequences of the deletion are explained in this policy.</p>\n<p>1.9\tSome of the legal bases we rely on are contractual and service necessity, consent, legitimate interests and compliance with legal obligations.\n.</p>\n<p>1.10\tWe want you to have the necessary and relevant understanding of how and why we process your personal data so that you can make fully informed decisions on whether to allow us to retain your personal data or delete them.\nSection 2 explains your rights under applicable law and section 3 lets you know when the Privacy Policy applies.</p>\n<p>1.11\tWe strive to keep the policy easy to understand and transparent, and so we refrain from technical information overload.\nIf you wish to have further details on how we process your personal data, please contact us.</p> 2.\nTalk to Us about Your Data\n<p>2.1\tWe try to ensure that the users of our products and services always have an open line of communication with us.\nYou can contact us at any time if you have any questions, queries or requests about your personal data and, if European law applies to the processing of your data, about your right to request access to, modify, remove or export your data, or object to our processing of your data.\nYou have the right to complain to supervisory authorities in your Member State should you feel your privacy has been breached, however we would appreciate it if you reach out to us first before you approach any supervisory authorities or courts.\nYou may submit requests to us at support@ccleaner.com.\nWe will action your request within one month of receiving a request from you concerning any one of your rights as a data subject.\nShould we be inundated with requests or particularly complicated requests, the time limit may be extended to a maximum of another two months.\nIf we fail to meet these deadlines, we would, of course, prefer that you contact us to settle the matter informally.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>2.2\tWe process your personal data where it is lawful and fair for us to do so.\nThe legal bases we rely for processing your personal data are contractual necessity, consent, legitimate interests and compliance with legal obligations.\n</p>\n<p>2.3\tThere could be instances where you are using our products or services, but we do not have your personal data, even though you have purchased our products or services.\nThese include situations where you purchase our products from our service provider, a reseller, or an app store.\nBecause your relationship in these cases is with that service provider, reseller or an app store, we do not actually have your personal data and will not be able to perform your request to access or delete your information.\nIn such circumstances, please contact your service provider, reseller, or app store where you purchased the products or services, as this person is the primary controller of your personal data.</p> 3.\nWhen Our Privacy Policy Applies <p>You should know that our Privacy Policy applies to the following situations and activities:</p>\n<p>3.1\tOnline activities<br>\nAny personal data collected from you when you visit our websites or use our products or services</p>\n<p>3.2\tPhone contacts<br>\nAny personal data collected from you when you call us for sales, service, or customer support.</p>\n<p>3.3\tOffline contacts<br>\nAny personal data collected from you at a \"live\" or in-person event such as a trade show or promotion.</p>\n<p>3.4\tReseller information<br>\nAny personal data, including contact information such as telephone number and email address, collected from our resellers or sub-resellers.\n</p>\n<p>3.5\tOther circumstances<br>\nAny personal data collected from you when you contact us by email or by clicking the \"report a virus\" link on our website or by requesting online service or support, or opening a support ticket, or through our media contact or news subscription services, or other occasions.</p> 4.\nWhen Our Privacy Policy Does Not Apply <p>4.1\tThird Party Sites</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clicking on a thumbnail or profile link on our \"Community\" pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will take you to the third-party site from which the thumbnail or link was imported.\nBy using a user ID from a third-party site, you agree to be governed by the terms and conditions, privacy policy, and data security policy of the third party.\nYou also agree that we are not responsible for any loss or damage you may suffer from your dealings with the third party, or your use of or reliance on any of that party's content.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submitting a search query</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you submit a search query via an app like AVG Secure Search or through Avast Secure Browser, you are indicating that you consent to having your search query and history transmitted to third party search providers and to being redirected to third party sites, where the privacy policies of the third parties apply </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third party links</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Third parties may also provide links to other websites and mobile applications (apps).\nAny sharing of data with third parties through access to and use of third party advertisements, their linked websites or mobile apps is not governed by this privacy policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third party privacy practices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties.\nYour use of a third-party site will be governed by the terms and conditions, privacy policy, and data security policy of the third-party site.</p> 5.\nDisclosing Your Personal Data to Third Parties <p>5.1\tDisclosure to third parties<br> We are required to disclose your personal data to unrelated third parties in limited circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>where necessary to satisfy a legitimate government request or order;</li>\n<li>in compliance to a legal requirement by a court of law or in the public interest;</li>\n<li>in response to a third-party subpoena, if we believe on the advice of our attorneys that we are required to respond.\n</li>\n<li>where we hire a contractor to perform a service for us, such as product development or market research (but not if doing so would violate the terms of our privacy policy, or laws governing personal data).\n</li>\n<li>If we obtain your permission.\nor</li>\n<li>If necessary to defend ourselves or our users (for example, in a lawsuit).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5.2 We are also required in a few limited situations to share our users' personal information with third parties.\nFor example, if you request a specific service or product from us, and if that product or service is administered by a third party working for us, we may share your personal information with the third party to respond to your request.\nThis third party may also transmit back to us any new information obtained from you in connection with providing the service or product.</p>\n<p>5.3\tWhen you contact us or a third-party service provider working on our behalf, our service provider may suggest upgrades to our products or services.\nOur service provider may also suggest products or service that the service provider offers which are not our products or services.\nIn this case, you will be clearly advised that the product or service is offered by the third party and not by Avast, and you will be subject to the terms and conditions, end user license agreement (EULA), and privacy policy of the third-party service provider.</p>\n<p>5.4\tWe offer third party browsers to new users of certain products, such as our antivirus products.\nWhether you install the third party browser is in your discretion.</p>\n<p>5.5\tFor certain mobile products, we offer third party ads.\nWhile we do not share your personal data with the ad network, data from your device including its IP Address, is used by the ad network to enable the delivery of the ads.\nIf you do not want to view third party ads, you have the choice to change to a paid version of the product.\nIf you are served a third party ad and you click on the ad, your data will be governed by the relevant third party whose ad you clicked on.</p>\n<p>5.6\tWe reserve the right to store and use the information collected by our software.\nWe may publish or share that information with third parties that are not part of the Avast Group, but we will only ever do so after anonymizing the data.\n</p> 6.\nInternational Transfers of Your Personal Data <p>6.1\tWe are a global business that provides its products and services all around the world.\nIn order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe.\nThe servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live.\nIn some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), where the level of protection provided by the laws of these countries may be different than the high standard enshrined in the GDPR.\nRegardless, we provides the same GDPR-level of protection to all personal data it processes.\n<br>\nAt the same time, when we transfer personal data outside of the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate and suitable safeguards, such as standardized contracts approved by the European Commission, which legally bind the receiving party to adhere to a high level of protection, and to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected.<br>\nSituations where we transfer personal data outside of the EEA include provision of our products and services, processing of transactions and your payment details, and the provision of support services.</p> 7.\nSharing of Information Among Avast Entities <p>7.1\tOur data collection and management practices do not vary by location.\nWe follow the same \u201cdata minimisation\u201d procedure with respect to all personal data in our possession, regardless of the jurisdiction from which it was collected, and regardless of whether the data is transferred from one member of the Avast Group to another.</p>\n<p>7.2\tWe reserve the right to store and use the information collected by our software and to share such information among the Avast Group to improve our current and future products and services, to help us develop new products and services, and to better understand the behaviour of our users.\n</p>\n<p>7.3\tAny reference in this policy to \u201cAvast Group\u201d means Avast, its, direct and indirect, parent companies and any company that is, directly or indirectly, controlled by or under common control with Avast or its parent companies.\n</p> 8.\nStorage, Retention, and Deletion of Your Personal Data <p>8.1\tStorage of Information<br>\nWe store information that we collect on our servers or on the servers of our subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, representatives, contractors, agents, or resellers who are working on our behalf.<br>\nThe data on our servers can only be accessed from our physical premises, or via an encrypted virtual private network (\u201cVPN\u201d).\nAccess is limited to authorised personnel only, and company networks are password protected, and subject to additional policies and procedures for security.</p>\n<p>8.2\tAccess by our contractors<br>\nWe or our contractors, subsidiaries, affiliates, representatives, agents, or resellers who are working on our behalf undertake regular maintenance of your personal data.\nAll third parties must agree to observe the privacy of our users, and to protect the confidentiality of their personal information.\nThis means your personal data cannot be shared with others, and there must be no direct marketing by the third parties.</p>\n<p>8.3\tRetention and Deletion of Your Personal Data<br> We retain and delete the various types of personal data we collect in compliance with the legal requirement that personal data be kept in a form that permits identification of our data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is being\tprocessed.<br> We will not keep your personal data in a form that allows you to be identified for longer than reasonably necessary with regards to the purpose for which the information was collected.\nWe will also anonymize and aggregate data to the extent possible.\n<br> In general, we strive to delete or obfuscate Internet Protocol (IP) addresses within 60 days when the purpose for which they were collected has been fulfilled.\nWe may retain online identifiers, location data and other personal data for statistical purposes as permitted under applicable law.<br> We may also amend the personal data we keep in such a way that you cannot be identified, for example, by hashing.\nWe may retain a \u201ckey\u201d to the hashing, but we will securely store it separately from the hashed data.\n<br> We will only keep your personal data for additional periods following the expiration of the purpose for which we collected it when permitted as compatible for our legitimate interests or required by law, for example tax, contract, secrecy or criminal laws.\nOtherwise, your personal data will be automatically deleted from our system once the legal basis for the collection and processing has been fulfilled.<br> If you are an active paid user, we need to retain your personal data for mailing or billing purposes.\nIf you subscribe to a recurring newsletter, we will keep your information to continue to fulfil your subscription request.\nIn the case of Avast Forum, Support Portal, or Avast news and blogs, your account data is kept active until you delete it.<br> If you participate in a giveaway or promotion that we offer, we will retain your data long enough to administer the promotion, plus any additional time that is permitted or required by law.<br> For the purpose of licensing products that are registered on a periodic basis, we will keep your personal data on the legal basis of contractual necessity for as long as you are actively using the product and thereafter for legal compliance.\nThereafter, your personal data will be deleted.<br>\n</p>9.\nHow You Can Request Deletion <p>For our paid and trial customers of products and services for your personal computer, and some free users with an Avast account, you will be able to log in to our GDPR portal with your email address, which will be verified, to request deletion of your personal data.\n</p>\n<p>For other users of our free products and services, you may request Avast to delete your personal data by submitting a request ticket here.\nHowever, please note, if you have not registered your email with Avast before requesting deletion of personal data, we will not respond to you.\nWe will not keep your email address if we do not have an email match in our system of registered users.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances and to the extent permitted by law, for example, to provision the service or contract, for compatible use for our legitimate interests, under national tax, contract, criminal, or secrecy laws, we may retain your personal data despite your requests for erasure.\n</p> 10.\nEffects of Request \u2013 How Long Before Deletion and Consequences of Deletion <p>10.1\tDepending on what you request and how many requests we receive, it is possible for your requests to be actioned from within a day to three months.\nFor example, paid, trial and registered customers may log-in to the GDPR portal to request a change of address and we will give effect to this typically within a couple days.</p>\n<p>10.2\tIf you request the erasure of your data (\u201cright to be forgotten\u201d), we will generally action this within 30 days, which may only include a record in our system that once the legal basis for processing your personal data has been fulfilled, your personal data needs to be promptly deleted.</p> 11.\nData Security <p>11.1\tSafeguards for protection of personal information\nWe maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of your personal data.\n</p>\n<p>11.2\tAdministrative safeguards<br>\nAccess to the personal data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts.\nIn the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed.\nThese third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave.\nWhere an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.</p>\n<p>11.3\tTechnical safeguards<br>\nWe store your personal information in our database using the protections described above.\nIn addition, we utilize up-to-date firewall protection for an additional layer of security.\nWe use high-quality antivirus and anti-malware software, and regularly update our virus definitions.\nThird parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to implement privacy and security practices that we deem adequate.</p>\n<p>11.4\tPhysical safeguards<br>\nAccess to user information in our database by Internet is not permitted except using an encrypted virtual private network (VPN).\nOtherwise, access is limited to our physical premises.\nPhysical removal of personal data from our location is forbidden.\nThird-party contractors who process personal data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.</p>\n<p>11.5\tProportionality<br>\nWe strive to collect no more personal data from you than is required by the purpose for which we collect it.\nThis, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk.</p>\n<p>11.6\tNotification in the event of breach<br>\nIn the unlikely event of a breach in the security of personal data, we will notify all users who are actually or potentially affected.</p>\n<p>We may tailor the method of notice depending on the circumstances.\nWhere the only contact information that we have for you is an email address, then the notification will necessarily be by email.\nWe may also elect to give you notice via our in-product messaging system.\nWhere we believe there are affected users for which we have no contact information on file, we may give notice via publication on our company website.\n</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to delay notification if we are asked to do so by law enforcement or other authorities, or if we believe that giving notice immediately will increase the risk of harm to our user body overall.</p> 12.\nOther Jurisdictions <p>Residents of the Russian Federations</p>\n<p>We collect and process personal data on the territory of the Russian Federation in strict compliance with the applicable laws of the Russian Federation.<br> We collect and process personal data (including sharing it with third parties) only upon the consent of the respective individuals, unless otherwise is provided for by the laws of the Russian Federation.\nYou will be asked to grant your consent by ticking the respective box / or clicking \u201cI accept\u201d button or through similar mechanism prior to having access to the site, and/or when submitting or sharing the personal data we may request.\nWe collect and use your

record, systematize, accumulate, store, actualize (update and amend), extract personal data of the Russian Federation citizens with the use of databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation, except as otherwise permitted by Russian data protection legislation.\nWe may process personal data of Russian citizens using databases located outside of the Russian Federation subject to compliance with Russian data protection legislation.<br> We undertake all the actions necessary to ensure security of your personal data.\nYou are legally entitled to receive information related to processing your personal data.\nTo exercise this right, you have to submit a request by e-mail at: support@ccleaner.com with the headline \u201cPRIVACY REQUEST\u201d in the message line.<br> You have the right to revoke the consent at any time by sending us an e-mail at: support@ccleaner.com with the headline \u201cPRIVACY REQUEST\u201d in the message line.\nOnce we receive the revocation notice from you we will stop processing and destroy your personal data, except as necessary to provision the contract or service to you.\nHowever, please note once you have revoked your consent, we may not be able to provide to you the products and services you request, and may not be able to ensure proper work of our products.<br> We do not transfer your personal data to the countries that under Russian law are not deemed to provide adequate protection to the individuals\u2019 rights in the area of data privacy.<br> We do not offer, sell or otherwise make available our products or services that have access to, collect and process (or allow us to do the same) personal data of third parties in the Russian Federation without the consent of such third parties.<br> If any provisions of this Policy contradict the provisions of this section, the provisions of this section shall prevail.</p>\n<p>Your California Privacy Rights</p>\n<p>Under California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.83, we are required to disclose to consumers the following information upon written request: (1) the categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties within the prior year, if that information was subsequently used for marketing purposes.\nand (2) the names and addresses of all such third parties to whom such the personal information was disclosed.\nWe hereby disclose that we have not disclosed any such personal information regarding any California resident during the one-year period prior to the effective date of this Privacy Policy.\nCalifornia residents seeking

of collecting it with your city and country or we hash your IP Address.</p> G.\nIn-Product Messaging <p>We sometimes communicate with you using a technique known as \"in-product messaging.\" In-product messaging may be used in the following scenarios:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when your license is about to expire;</li>\n<li>when you update or upgrade an us program.\n</li>\n<li>when a virus database is updated.\n</li>\n<li>when you visit an infected webpage.\n</li>\n<li>when a monthly security report is prepared for you.\nor </li>\n<li>in other cases where user communication is necessary for provision of our products or services.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We also use in-product messaging to notify you of different products or upgrades to existing products and services.\nData used for in-product messaging is connected to the GUID for in-product messaging to function.\nFor free users, this data remains anonymous and for paid customers, the data is pseudonymized.</p>\n<p>Billing Data is however not used for in-product messaging.\nIn-product messaging also permits your computer or device to transmit information to our servers including technical data, virus definitions, security, and technical information about your hardware.\n</p>\n<p>The data may be used to offer you a discount on a new product based on your past purchases.\nData is also used for analytical and statistical purposes, product updates, quality control, and in-product and feature design.\nPremium or paid customers can manage In-product messaging for marketing purposes in the applicable product settings.\n</p> H.\nService Data\n<p>Service Data is collected from your use of our websites, products, and services.</p>\n<p>Service Data is used primarily to provision the products or services.\nService Data is also used for the compatible and legitimate uses of research, to compile statistics, analytics, aggregated reporting, product development, In-product messaging, and direct marketing.\nBefore Service Data is used for secondary purposes, us pseudonymizes or anonymizes the Service Data.\n</p>\n<p>For all Service Data, we practice \u201cdata minimization\u201d, which means we limit our collection and retention of your data to only what is necessary, adequate and relevant to achieve our processing purpose.\n</p>\n<p>Below we list our products and the Service Data that each collects.\nThere may be other products (current or future) that require us to collect certain types of personal data to enable full product functionality.\nWe will always inform you prior to collecting any such information, usually in the terms of service or end user license agreement (EULA) or the privacy notice applicable to the product or service.\nPersonal data collected as part of Service Data is necessary to the provision of the product functionality.\nWhen personal data is no longer needed we limit or stop using it in line with the minimization principle.\nFor example, your email, the URLs of websites you have visited, your files, are scanned for malware detection and protection.\nthen we remove your email address and other personal data or we hash any identifiers turning the Service Data into pseudonymized or anonymized data for paid users and anonymized data for free users before we re-use the Service Data for research, analytics, statistics, reporting, cross-product development, in-product messaging, and marketing.</p>\n<p>The primary processing of Service Data will be to perform the contract to provision the product or service to you.\nThe secondary processing of Service Data will be as compatible for the legitimate interests of us to provide you the benefits of research, analytics, cross-product development, and cross-product in-product messaging.\nIf we need to process your Service Data for a purpose that requires consent, we will notify you separately of this and the general rules of providing and withdrawing consent shall apply.\n</p>\n<p>Website Log Files</p>\n<p>We collect the information in the form of server log files that tell us generally about the visitors to our site, which may include general geographic regions, length of visits, the webpages you request, the URLs of the site you were viewing before clicking on our websites, your IP Address, cookies, the type of web browser and operating system you are using, click-stream data and so forth.</p>\n<p>If a user downloads a product from our website, we connect the installation GUID with the user\u2019s website log.\nWe use this information to fulfil our legitimate interests, which are to analyse overall trends, administer our webpages, track users\u2019 use of the webpages, help us improve our website(s), and to better understand the users\u2019 experience on our website(s) when downloading and activating our products.</p>\n<p>Device and Network Information</p>\n<p>We may collect information about the computer or device you are using, our products and services running on it, and, depending on the type of device it is, what operating systems you are using, device settings, application identifiers (AI), hardware identifiers or universally unique identifiers (UUID), software identifiers, IP Address, location data, cookie IDs, and crash data (through the use of either our own analytical tools or tolls provided by third parties, such as Crashlytics or Firebase).\nDevice and network data is connected to the installation GUID.</p>\n<p>We also use your device and network data for in-product-messaging and cross-product development.\nPremium or paid customers can manage in-product messaging for marketing purposes and cross-product development in the applicable product settings.</p>\n<p>We collect information in the form of statistics through our own or third-party analytics about which apps have been installed or uninstalled, how they are used, the number of active users, and the impact apps have on device performance and battery consumption (collectively, \u201cAppInfo\u201d).\nFrom this we study device and network behaviour, purchasing history and trends to measure the relative success of our products over time (in other words, serve our legitimate interests).</p>\n<p>Analytics and Crash Reporting</p>\n<p>We use analytical tools, including third party analytical tools, which allow us to, among other things, identify potential performance or security issues with our products, improve their stability and function, understand how you use our products, and websites, so that we can optimize and improve your user experience, as well as evaluate and improve our campaigns.\nWhile we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have

(you) and others to the business (Vendor).\nIf your claim is US$75,000 or less, Vendor will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer.\nVendor does not agree to bear any other costs.\nIf your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.</p>\n<p>11.6.2.\nExcept as provided in below, the AAA\u2019s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties.\nHowever, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a
