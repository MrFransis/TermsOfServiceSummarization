to provide.\nAdditionally, when the Service is utilized by an educational institution managing student \"Educational Records,\" some User Submissions may be deemed part of said education records (as defined in the \"FERPA and Student Data\" section below).You retain all ownership rights for any User Submissions.\nEdpuzzle does not claim any ownership rights over User Submissions.\nNevertheless, if your educational institution, company or organization has purchased a Pro Upgrade and granted you access to Edpuzzle's Pro features, it is possible that your institution, company or organization owns all intellectual property rights inherent to your content, depending on the contents of your employment agreement or the organization's internal regulations.\nEDPUZZLE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE

identifiable manner (including, for use in improving our service or for marketing and business development purposes);</li>\n<li> use any User Submission (including any Education Record) that has been

you delete any User Submissions with intellectual property rights (\u201cIP content\u201d), like photos or videos, you or your institution (as defined below) deletes an Education Record, you delete any personal information, or you delete your account, unless your content has been shared with others and they have not deleted it, or your content is part of an Education Record still under the control of your institution (e.g., co-teaching).\nIf you would like to delete any videos that may contain personal information regarding your identity, please review the \"How Do I Delete My Account?\" section of our Privacy Policy and follow the steps to request deletion.Edpuzzle will not heed any deletion requests of \"teacher accounts\" or \"teacher content\" made by the educational institution, company or organization, as this should be handled by the educational institution, company or organization itself in accordance with its internal regulations or teacher employment agreements.Additionally, when you delete IP content, Education Records, or personal information, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle or trash bin on a computer.\nHowever, you

that a User Submission infringes on someone\u2019s intellectual property rights.Our automated systems analyze your User Submissions (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, and for spam and malware detection.\nThis analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.\nEdpuzzle will not analyze any Educational Records for the purpose of providing behaviorally-targeted advertising to students, yet the aforementioned shall not be construed to limit Edpuzzle's ability to use Educational Records for

CLASS AND ITS MANAGEMENT, AS SET FORTH IN THE \"CO-TEACHING\" SECTION OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY.FERPA and Student DataCertain information that may be provided to Edpuzzle by School Personnel that is directly related to a student and maintained by an educational institution, may be considered an education record (\u201cEducation Record\u201d) under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d).\nAdditionally, certain information, provided to Edpuzzle by School Personnel about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered directory information under FERPA (\u201cDirectory Information\u201d) and thus not an Education Record.\nA school may not generally disclose personally identifiable information from an eligible student\u2019s education records to a third party without written consent of the parent and/or eligible student or without meeting one of the exemptions set forth in FERPA (\u201cFERPA Exemption(s)\u201d), including the exemption for Directory Information (\u201cDirectory Information Exemption\u201d) or disclosure to school officials with a legitimate educational interest (\u201cSchool Official Exemption\u201d).As School Personnel or the Institution providing Directory Information or any Education Record to Edpuzzle, you acknowledge, affirm and pledge to Edpuzzle, as applicable, that your Institution has:<ul>\n<li>complied with the Directory Information Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents and eligible students what information the Institution deems to be directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that schools do not disclose directory information about them.\nand/or</li>\n<li>complied with the School Official Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents in their annual notification of FERPA rights that the Institution defines \u201cschool official\u201d to include service providers and defines \u201clegitimate educational interest\u201d to include services such as the type provided by Edpuzzle.\nor</li>\n<li>obtained all necessary parental or eligible student written consent to share the Directory Information and Education Records with the Company, in each case, solely to enable the Company\u2019s operation of the Service.</li>\n</ul>Edpuzzle will never share Education Records with third parties except (i) as directed by an Edpuzzle user (i.e., teacher sharing with another teacher or parent).\nor (ii) to our service providers that are necessary for us to provide the Service, as stated in our Privacy Policy.\nEducation Records are never used or disclosed for third-party advertising or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising to students or parents.\nAdditionally, information collected directly from a student using Edpuzzle is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising, or any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally-targeted advertising, and personal information collected from a student is never sold or rented to anyone.\nThis section shall not be construed (i) to prohibit Edpuzzle from marketing or advertising directly to parents so long as the marketing or advertising did not result from the use of Education Records to provide behaviorally-targeted advertising or (ii) to limit the ability of Edpuzzle to use student information or Education Records for adaptive learning or customized student learning purposes.Edpuzzle may use Education Records that have been de-identified for product development, research or other purposes (\u201cDe-Identified Data\u201d).\nDe-Identified Data will have all direct and indirect personal identifiers removed.\nEdpuzzle agrees not to attempt to re-identify the De-Identified Data and not to transfer the De-Identified Data to a third party unless that party agrees not to attempt re-identification.GDPR and MinorsThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) determines that the processing of personal data of a child residing in the European Union shall be lawful where the child is at least sixteen (16) years old, unless Member States have provided, by law, a lower age that is not below thirteen (13) years.As a teacher, you acknowledge, affirm and pledge to Edpuzzle that you or your Institution has obtained all necessary parental or eligible student written consent to share the personal data of your students with Edpuzzle, in each case, solely to enable Edpuzzle's operation of the Service.If you have any issues with Edpuzzle's principles set out in these

eventually allow for integrations with third-party apps or tools (e.g., YouTube) to provide certain features and improve your experience when using the Service.\nAs a result, we are obligated to make you aware of certain terms related to the use of such features.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO THE FOLLOWING THIRD-PARTY SERVICES WHEN USING THEIR RESPECTIVE INTEGRATIONS WITH THE SERVICE:<ul>\n<li>YouTube's Application Programming Interface (\"YouTube API\") allows users to access detailed information about YouTube videos from the Edpuzzle's Website and browse any video available on the YouTube platform (governed by the YouTube Terms of Service<i>\n</i>).</li>\n<li>Screencastify is a screen recorder for Google Chrome that allows users to

Company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third-party websites, or which are posted to or through the Service by other users.\nYour interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Service are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.\nYou should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline interaction with any other person.<ul>\n<li>User disputes: Edpuzzle is not responsible for the actions, content, information or data of other third parties, including other users.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of the Services, and any other parties

unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes, including damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, privacy or data.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code \u00a71542, which says: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\" And, if you are not a California resident, you waive any applicable state statutes to a similar effect.</li>\n</ul>Modification to AgreementWe may modify this Agreement or Guidelines to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services.\nYou should check the Agreement regularly.\nWe will post notice of material changes to this Agreement on this page.\nChanges will not apply retroactively and will only become effective when (a) you use the Service after you know about the change, or (b) thirty days after they are posted (whichever is sooner).\nHowever, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.\nYour continued use of the Services following notice of the changes to the Agreement or Guidelines, constitutes your acceptance of our amended terms, policies or guidelines.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE MODIFIED AGREEMENT, PLEASE DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.As stated in our Privacy Policy, Edpuzzle will not change how Education Records are used or shared under these Terms of Service without advance notice and consent from the competent school or institution.TerminationThis Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Service.\nYou may terminate your

authorized school official.\nThe Company may suspend or terminate your access to the Service or your account at any time, for any reason (without cause or for your violation of any term of this Agreement), and without warning or notice, which may result in the loss of information associated with your account.\nUpon termination of your account, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.\nAll provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.Dispute Resolution(A) Generally: in the interest of resolving disputes between you and the Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and the Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nOur agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to, all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, including any other Guidelines and future modifications, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service.\nYou understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and the Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.(B) Exceptions: notwithstanding subsection (A), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.(C) Arbitration: any arbitration between you and the Company will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting the Company.(D) Notice: a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nThe Company's address for Notice is:Edpuzzle, Inc.\n<br>833 Market Street, Suite 427, <br>San Francisco, CA 94103, <br>United States of America <br>The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or the Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nprovided that our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, the Company shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the greatest amount offered by the Company in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award.(E) Fees: in the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, the Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.(F) No Class Actions: you and the Company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.\nFurthermore, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.(G) Enforceability: if only Subsection F of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described elsewhere in this Section shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.Limitation of LiabilityWe provide our Service using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using it.\nBut there are certain things that we do not promise about our Services.DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.\nTHE SERVICE (AND ANY ASSOCIATED CONTENT OR SOFTWARE) IS PROVIDED ON AN \u201cAS IS\u201d BASIS.\nTHE COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,

DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, COST OF COVER, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF EDPUZZLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO (i) THIS AGREEMENT.\n(ii) YOUR USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, CONTENT, OR USER SUBMISSIONS.\nOR (iii) ANY INTERACTION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY THROUGH OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING OTHER USERS.IN NO EVENT WILL EDPUZZLE OR ITS SUCCESSORS, AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, EMPLOYEES, LICENSORS, PARTNERS OR AGENTS, BE LIABLE TO YOU IN THE AGGREGATE (FOR ALL POTENTIAL CLAIMS BY YOU) FOR ANY DAMAGES INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF ANY FEES YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID TO COMPANY FOR USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES.\nIF YOU RESIDE IN SUCH A JURISDICTION, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.Contact EdpuzzleIf you have any questions or concerns about

PolicyOverviewWhat Is Edpuzzle?Edpuzzle Privacy PrinciplesProtecting Our StudentsInformation CollectedSecurity MeasuresManaging My InformationConsumer ComplaintsLocal RegulationsEuropeCaliforniaNew YorkOther Countries<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>OverviewLast Updated Oct.\n7th: Due to the recent decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidating Privacy Shield, Edpuzzle has updated its Privacy Policy to add the relevant Standard Contractual Clauses <i>\n</i>(\"SCC\") as a transfer mechanism for personal data being transferred out of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom to the United States.\nThis update is solely to address the recent developments for GDPR compliance and does not give Edpuzzle any additional rights over your data, and you do not need to take any action.Edpuzzle\u2019s mission is to help teachers engage their students through the power of video learning.\nWe are humbled that millions of teachers and students like you trust Edpuzzle every day.\nEarning your trust by ensuring your privacy and safety is therefore extremely important to us.This Privacy Policy explains:<ul>\n<li>What information Edpuzzle collects from you (and why we collect it).</li>\n<li>How we use and share that information.</li>\n<li>The choices you have, including how to access, update and delete your information.</li>\n<li>This Policy applies to all products and services offered by Edpuzzle, Inc.\n(hereinafter referred to as \u201cEdpuzzle,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\" \u201cour,\u201d also including our subsidiaries or affiliates).</li>\n</ul>SECTIONS WRITTEN IN CAPITAL LETTERS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR LEGAL COMPLIANCE, SO PLEASE MAKE SURE TO REVIEW THEM CAREFULLY.We have done our best to write this Policy in simple, clear terms.\nWe encourage you to read it carefully, together with any other privacy notice we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you, so that you are aware of how and why we are using such information.<ul>\n<li>Purpose of processing: provide access to and use of Edpuzzle services (website and mobile apps).</li>\n<li>Legal grounds: processing based on user consent, contract performance and the legitimate interest of the company or third parties.</li>\n<li>Recipients: Edpuzzle third-party service providers which help provide the Service.\nPlease see the Security measures section of this Privacy Policy for more information.</li>\n<li>User rights: access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection and data portability (see the Edpuzzle Privacy Principles section of this Privacy Policy).\nFor exercising any of the rights mentioned, please contact Edpuzzle\u2019s DPO.</li>\n<li>Data Protection Officer (DPO): for inquiries regarding this Privacy Policy please contact Edpuzzle\u2019s DPO at privacy@edpuzzle.com or at the physical address listed at the end of this Policy.</li>\n<li>Additional information: to be found in Edpuzzle\u2019s Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy.</li>\n</ul>Personal information is any information you provide to us that personally identifies you, like your name or email address, or any other information which we could reasonably link to your identity.\nWe will only collect, use, and share your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nThis Policy applies whether you use Edpuzzle through edpuzzle.com (the \u201cEdpuzzle Website\u201d), our mobile applications (the \u201cEdpuzzle Apps\u201d), your school's Learning Management Systems (LMS) with which Edpuzzle has been integrated (e.g., Google Classroom, Canvas, Moodle, Schoology, etc.) or any of our other products or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the \u201cService\u201d).\nIn addition, this Privacy Policy also covers Edpuzzle's treatment of any personal information about our users that our partners or other services might share with us.This Policy does not apply to websites or services or practices of companies that Edpuzzle does not own or control, such as third-party services you might access through links or other features (e.g., social media buttons.\nthird-party integrations) on the Service.\nThese other services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them before providing them with personal information.\nAt the end of this Privacy Policy you will find a list with our third-party service providers and a link to their privacy policies, as well as an overview to how, why and under which conditions they might process your personal information.Whether you are new here (welcome!), or have been using Edpuzzle for a long time (welcome back!), please do take the time to get to know our privacy practices.\nWe believe them to be fairly clear and friendly, but if you have any questions, we are here to help.\nTo learn more about how we protect your privacy, send us an email at privacy@edpuzzle.com.\nBY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.Additionally, in our commitment to protecting children's privacy, Edpuzzle participates in the iKeepSafe Safe Harbor program.\nEdpuzzle has been granted the iKeepSafe FERPA, COPPA and CSPC seals signifying that our website and apps have been reviewed and approved for having policies and practices surrounding the collection, use, maintenance and disclosure of personal information from children consistent with the iKeepSafe FERPA, COPPA and CSPC programs guidelines.Edpuzzle is also a signatory of the Student Privacy Pledge, agreeing to a set of principles intended to safeguard student privacy, including responsible stewardship, protection, and transparent handling of student personal information.\nRead more about the Student Privacy Pledge here<i>\n</i>.In compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), this Privacy Policy incorporates the Edpuzzle Standard Contractual Clauses (\"ESCC\"), when the GDPR applies to your use of the Edpuzzle Services and personal data is transferred to third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection.\nFurther information in this regard can be found in the Europe section of this Privacy Policy.What is Edpuzzle?Edpuzzle is a simple, easy-to-use video platform that helps teachers engage their students.\nIn the classroom, teachers use Edpuzzle to give students video lessons that they watch through the Edpuzzle Apps, Edpuzzle Website or the school's LMS.\nIf multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other.\nBeyond the classroom, teachers use Edpuzzle to engage students at home and access this video learning anywhere.\nEdpuzzle collects students' viewing history and quiz responses which teachers can view instantly.Students can create their own account, but can only tie that account to a class after they receive a unique code from their teacher.\nAs further explained below in the \"Which are Edpuzzle's Commitments to providing Transparency and Choice\" section of this Privacy Policy, if the school or teacher elects to utilize Edpuzzle with students under a specific age, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under the applicable laws.\nNo teachers or school members will be provided with a unique code for their students unless they consciously agree to this Policy, by reading and accepting the Privacy Policy notice given prior to signing up and in the verification email sent upon sign-up.Edpuzzle Privacy PrinciplesWhat are Edpuzzle's principles when processing personal information?In collecting and processing your personal information, we will comply with the data protection laws and regulations in force at the time.\nThis requires that the personal information we hold about you must be:<ul>\n<li> Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.</li>\n<li> Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in a way that is incompatible with those purposes.</li>\n<li> Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes.</li>\n<li> Accurate and kept up-to-date.</li>\n<li> Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about.</li>\n<li> Kept securely.</li>\n</ul>Why does edpuzzle collect personal information from its users?Edpuzzle collects personal information from users in order to provide the Service.\nConcretely, the personal information of students and teachers is collected and used for the following purposes:<ul>\n<li> To create the necessary accounts to use the Service.</li>\n<li> To provide teachers with analytics on student progress.</li>\n<li> To help teachers connect with other teachers from the same school or district.</li>\n<li> To send email updates to teachers, if applicable.</li>\n<li> To assess the quality of the Service.</li>\n<li> To secure and safeguard personal information.</li>\n<li> To access premium features, if applicable.</li>\n<li> To comply with all applicable laws on the protection of personal information.</li>\n</ul>What are my rights when using Edpuzzle?Your rights relating to your personal information include:<ul>\n<li> to be informed about how Edpuzzle uses your personal information;</li>\n<li> to request access to personal information held by Edpuzzle, and to have any incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete personal information rectified;</li>\n<li> where appropriate, to restrict processing concerning you or to object to processing;</li>\n<li> to have personal information erased where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.\nand</li>\n<li> where applicable, to portability of personal data, that is to say, to receive your personal information in a structured and commonly used format.</li>\n</ul>Which are my responsibilities when Using Edpuzzle?We require that your personal information is accurate.\nPlease let us know if the personal information you provided us for creating your account has changed.\nIf we do not have the correct information, we cannot take responsibility for information-related errors.Additionally, if we determine that you are in violation of this Policy, you will be subject to disciplinary action that could eventually lead to the banning of your account.What are Edpuzzle\u2019s commitments to providing transparency and choice?We try to be transparent about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used.\nFor example, you can:<ul>\n<li> Opt-out of providing certain information.</li>\n<li> Access and manage your account information by using the account settings within Edpuzzle.</li>\n<li> Control who you share information with.</li>\n<li> Remove information from Edpuzzle.</li>\n<li> Take information out of Edpuzzle.</li>\n</ul>NoticeWhen providing you with information on the processing of your personal information, such as its collection, transfer to other countries, types or identity of third parties to which we disclose that information and the purposes for which we do so, we will make sure that such information is provided in clear and understandable language.\nAlso, initial notice on our practices and policies will be provided when you are first asked to provide personal information to us, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before we use the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.ChoiceWe will offer you the opportunity to choose (by either opting-out or opting-in) if your personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a third party different from those listed in this Privacy Policy, or (b) to be used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.Change of PurposeWe will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason which is compatible with the original purpose.\nIf we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.Contract PerformanceWhen, as a teacher or school representative, or when acting on behalf of a company or other organization, you create an Edpuzzle account, you provide your first and last name and an email address.\nWe require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract.ConsentIf you are a teacher or school representative, or use the Service on behalf of a company or other organization, note that Edpuzzle provides its Service upon explicit consent given by you when signing up.\nPrior to signing up, we will direct you to our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.\nWhen signing up, you will be declaring to have read such policies and to consent to them.\nRemember, nonetheless, that you will be able to withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your account in accordance with this Policy's Managing My Information section.EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND MUST THEREFORE TAKE SPECIAL CARE WHEN REVIEWING THIS PRIVACY POLICY.\nEDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING, WHERE APPLICABLE, PERTINENT CONSENT FROM PARENTS, LEGAL GUARDIANS OR ELIGIBLE STUDENTS (THOSE WHO ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR ATTEND A POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTION) PRIOR TO UTILIZING THE SERVICE.\nEDPUZZLE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY NEGLIGENCE OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IN THE REVIEWING OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR THE OBTAINMENT, WHERE APPLICABLE, OF THE NECESSARY PARENTAL CONSENT.U.S.\nEducational Institutions and Parental Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"school consent.\" At the same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\nAccordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their use of Edpuzzle meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent requirement.\nTypically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent under FERPA when Edpuzzle is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Edpuzzle is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees.European Educational Institutions and GDPR: According to article 8 of the GDPR, minors shall be entitled to give valid consent only if they are 16 years old (unless Member States have set a lower age limit which, nonetheless, cannot be under 13 years old).\nUnder that age limit, processing of personal information related to minors shall be subject to parental consent.\nSchools are in control of their students\u2019 personal information and are obliged to take all necessary measures for protecting said information.\nThis means that schools will have to be especially cautious when contracting any service that may require disclosure of student personal information.\nIn other words, schools are data controllers in terms of GDPR and thus determine the purposes and means of the processing of student personal data.\nAs a consequence, schools will also be responsible for informing students and their parents accordingly about what data is collected, which are the purposes of collection, how data is used and to which third parties it is disclosed, including Edpuzzle.Legitimate InterestsGenerally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of third parties.\nFor example, for legal compliance purposes or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of Edpuzzle's systems, website, and overall services, we must keep logs of Technical Information.\nand, in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.As foreseen in the \"Restrictions\" and \"Account Bans\" sections of our Terms of Service , the breach of certain rules in the use of the Service may lead to the suspension or indefinite ban of your account, depending on the severity of the offense.\nIn the event of an indefinite account ban, Edpuzzle may keep part of your personal information, such as, but not limited to, IP address and email address, to prevent you from accessing or using the Service.How will Edpuzzle notify me of changes to this policy?We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy.\nYou can see when the last update was by looking at the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date at the top of this page.\nWe will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.\nIf we make any significant changes, we will provide prominent notice by posting a notice on the Service and/or notifying you by email (using the email address you provided) prior to and after changes taking effect, so you can review and make sure you're aware of them.We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time, to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through the Service.\nIf you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may delete your account (although we will be sad to see you go!).\nBy continuing to use the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to the current version of the Privacy Policy.Protecting Our StudentsWhat information does Edpuzzle collect from children, and how is it used?Except for the \"Open Class\" feature as explained below, Edpuzzle collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide a unique username, a unique email, a password, their first and last name and a unique code they have been given by their teacher to join a class.\nBeyond this information, students can submit responses, comments, audios or images depending on the activities they are assigned, which will remain private between teacher and student.\nAll this information will only be used for the purposes of the school/teacher.\nIn addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the \"Information Collected Automatically\" section.We use this information to provide the Service to the child, for security and safety purposes, or as required by law or to enforce our Terms.\nWe will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service.\nIf we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, FERPA or any other applicable laws or regulations, we will take appropriate steps to delete the information.\nWe do not disclose any personal information about children to third parties, except to service providers necessary to provide the Service, as required by law, or to protect the security of the Service or other users.\nInformation collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising, including any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally targeted advertising, and children\u2019s personal information is never sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers.When using the Open Class feature, students can access and use the Edpuzzle service without the need to create an account.\nIn this modality, students may have to provide a nickname, and only responses will be collected and processed by the Service.What children\u2019s information is visible to others?No student\u2019s profile is made available or visible to the public, or to any other students, through Edpuzzle.\nTeachers may share their classes, including grades or scores, with other teachers they co-teach with in their school, to help them collaborate.\nIf the teacher chooses to display Edpuzzle in their classroom, either by utilizing the \"live mode\" feature of the Service or by projecting via a smartboard or interactive whiteboard, students physically present in that classroom may see other students\u2019 names, responses, comments or total scores.EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND TEACHERS SHALL MAKE A RESPONSIBLE USE OF THE SERVICE AND AVOID COMPROMISING CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES WHEN DISPLAYING EDPUZZLE IN THE CLASSROOM.\nEDPUZZLE SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE INAPPROPRIATE USE OF THE SERVICE BY THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION OR THE TEACHER.How long does Edpuzzle keep children\u2019s information?We only keep a child\u2019s personal information for as long as his or her student account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms:<ul>\n<li> Minimal information: As mentioned before, Edpuzzle collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide first name, last name, email, a username and a password.\nConsistent with the requirements of FERPA and COPPA in the United States and of GDPR in Europe, among other applicable laws, we only collect, use, share, and retain student personal information for purposes for which we were authorized by the educational institution/agency, teacher or the student.Beyond this information, students can submit responses, comments, audios or images depending on the activities they are assigned, that will remain private between teacher and student.\nIn addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the \"Information collected automatically\" section.</li>\n<li> Deleting inactive accounts: If a student\u2019s account is inactive for eighteen (18) months or more (meaning the student has not used his or her account), Edpuzzle will automatically delete the student account, including all personal information provided by the student or collected by Edpuzzle from the student, as well as questions, responses or comments associated with the account.\nThe mentioned eighteen (18) month term has been calculated in accordance with the estimated use of the Service, which usually coincides with an entire school year, plus an additional period of time in case teachers want to renew the use of the Service.\nIf the day in which the account should be deleted does not exist in the corresponding month (e.g., last day of activity being the 30th of August and deletion programmed for February of the following year, which only has 28 or 29 days), deletion will be performed on the last day of the 18th month.</li>\n</ul>After deletion of the account Edpuzzle may retain copies and/or backups of the mentioned information for a maximum term of thirteen (13) months.\nNevertheless, Edpuzzle shall not be responsible for the accidental loss or destruction of data on behalf of users.\nEdpuzzle will not be obliged to recover erased data stored in backups when erasure is attributable to users.EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH THE RETENTION OF STUDENT EDUCATION RECORDS FOR AS LONG AS LEGALLY APPLICABLE.\nSTUDENT PROGRESS MAY BE SAVED FOR EITHER SHORTER OR LONGER PERIODS THAN THE ONES STATED ABOVE IF SO DECIDED BY THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION.\nTEACHER ACCOUNTS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH NECESSARY TOOLS TO MANAGE AND DELETE STUDENT INFORMATION.EDPUZZLE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ERASURE OF STUDENT PROGRESS DUE TO ACCOUNT DELETION AFTER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF INACTIVITY OR BECAUSE OF THE VOLUNTARY ELECTION TO DELETE TEACHER ACCOUNTS.\nSCHOOL OFFICIALS MAY REQUEST DELETION OF STUDENT INFORMATION AND CONTENT AT ANY TIME BY CONTACTING EDPUZZLE AT PRIVACY@EDPUZZLE.COM.Parental ChoicesAny parents that want copies of their children\u2019s personal information that we may have stored can contact their children\u2019s school personnel to that end.\nAt any time, the school can also refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from its students, and can request that we delete the personal information we have collected from them by contacting us at privacy@edpuzzle.com.\nPlease keep in mind that deleting records may require us to terminate the account in question.\nAlso remember that before we can share the information with the school, or delete it per your request, we will, by reasonable means, proceed to verify the identity of the requester.Information CollectedWhat information does Edpuzzle collect?We collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide us by using the Edpuzzle Service (described below under \"Information you provide to us\") and (2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under \u201cInformation collected automatically\u201d).\nThe types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher or student (e.g.\nwe collect minimal information from students) and how they use Edpuzzle (e.g.\nif teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).Information You Provide to UsThere are currently two categories of users on our Service: teachers and students.\nWe collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:<ul>\n<li> Account Sign-up and Profile Information: To create an Edpuzzle account as a teacher, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, password and profile photo.\nIf you create an Edpuzzle account as a student, you will be asked to enter your first name, last name, username, password and email.\nTeacher profiles may be viewed by other teachers in the same school or when searching for it through Edpuzzle's search engine.\nhowever, no student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.</li>\n<li> Subject, School Information and Collaboration Features: If you are a teacher, as part of the profile information you provide, you will be asked to to indicate the subject you teach.\nYou'll also be asked to choose to associate your account with an existing school or you may enter a new school name and possibly your school\u2019s address if we do not have it already.\nIf you are using the Service as a teacher, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you.\nBy connecting you with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers within the same school such as sharing videos.</li>\n<li> Class Information: As a teacher you will need to enter the grade level (e.g., first grade) and subject.\nYou will have the opportunity to change the names and passwords of the students in your class (these may or may not be the student\u2019s actual first and last names.\nit is entirely the teacher\u2019s choice what they enter here: for example, teachers could enter \u2018John S\u2019, \u2018John\u2019, \u2018JS\u2019, or \u2018Student 23\u2019 to describe the same person).\nIf a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on Edpuzzle with other teachers in their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class\u2019s information.\nStudents will also be able to create lessons (and add questions, comments, audio or images into them) if their teacher assigns a Student Project to them, but these lessons will remain private to their teachers.\nOnly if the teacher chooses to share them with the class, will the other students in the class be able to watch others\u2019 videos.</li>\n<li>Interactive Lessons: As a teacher you can upload your own videos (which may include your face or voice), record your voice (for small clarifications, warm introductions or replace the original audio) and add questions, comments or images at any point during the lesson.\nIf this content is set as public, other teachers may use it to teach other students all around the world.\nhowever, students will only see the videos assigned to them by their teachers.\n</li>\n<li>Responses, Grades and Feedback: As a student, you may have to write your own responses for open-ended questions included in your lessons.\nThey can only be viewed by your teacher, as well as any grades - corresponding to either multiple choice or open ended questions - and any private messages exchanged with the teacher for further discussion about a specific response.</li>\n<li>Contact Information: When you choose to provide us with your personal information through the Service in some other manner (e.g., when you request a quote for upgrading to a \"Pro Plan\" at your school, when you submit a copyright claim or report any media on our platform, when you send us an email asking a question, submit a support request, participate in a video testimonial about our Service, or choose to participate in any research efforts with Edpuzzle to improve the Service).</li>\n<li>Billing Information: When subscribing to any of our \"Pro Plan\" options, you will be asked to provide necessary information for processing the payment (e.g., credit/debit card number).\nAs further explained in the Security Measures section of this Privacy Policy, payments are processed over Stripe.</li>\n</ul>Our use of the information above is described below in the \"How Does Edpuzzle Use the Information it Collects?\u201d section.\nIf you are using the Edpuzzle App, we may ask you for certain permissions.Information Collected AutomaticallyLike most web-based services, we (or our service providers) may automatically receive and log information on our server logs from your browser or your device when you use the Service.\nFor example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to Edpuzzle (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show).\nIf you use Edpuzzle on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices.\nIf we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.The technologies and information we automatically collect include:<ul>\n<li> Cookies and Other Similar Technologies: We (or our service providers) may use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our Service, including clear GIFs (also known as \u201cweb beacons\u201d), \u201ctags\u201d, \u201cscripts\u201d, and \u201ccookies\u201d.\nWe also make use of persistent secure cookies: persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (although they can be removed) and may be used by your browser to identify you on subsequent visits to the Service.\nWe may also use, collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5).\nLike many services, Edpuzzle uses these technologies to tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.</li>\n<li> Device Information: We collect, through our third-party analytics services, device-specific information such as your operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers.\nThis helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve Edpuzzle for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you\u2019ve opted in to receive them.</li>\n<li> Log Information: Like most online services, when you use our Service, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs.\nExamples include:<ul>\n<li> Details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Service, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Edpuzzle Website or Edpuzzle App (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show).</li>\n<li> IP Address.</li>\n<li> Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li>\n</ul> This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular.</li>\n<li>Location Information: When you use our Service we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example through GPS, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi signals.\nWe collect coarse (i.e., city-level) location data.We will not store or track your device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission.\nWe do not share precise geolocation data with third parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Service.\n</li>\n<li>Learning Management System (LMS) Interfaces: When accessing Edpuzzle through your institution, company or organization's LMS (e.g., Google Classroom, Blackboard, Canvas or Moodle, among others), we may collect and process information related to this kind of use of the Service, such as your school user ID, your profile picture, information on the LMS interface and the LTI version used and your school domain name.</li>\n</ul>Automated Decision Making and ProfilingAutomated Decision Making (ADM) refers to a decision which is taken solely on the basis of automated processing of your personal data.\nThis means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not require human intervention.Profiling means using automated processes without human intervention (such as computer programmes) to analyse your personal information in order to evaluate your behaviour or to predict things about you which are relevant in the context of using Edpuzzle, such as what kind of videos you used.As profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision-making.\nNot all profiling results in automated decision-making, but it can.If you are a teacher, we may use profiling or other forms of automated processing to show you personalized content and make recommendations through the web and/or email based on, but not limited to, your usage, subject area, school and country.If you are a student (or the parent or legal guardian of a student), we may use profiling or other forms of automated processing to provide your teacher or teachers with analytics on your progress, depending on the videos you have watched and responses to quizzes you have submitted.How does Edpuzzle use the information it collects?First and foremost, you should know that Edpuzzle does not sell or rent any of your, or your students' personal information to any third party for any purpose including for advertising or marketing purposes.\nWe use the information we collect from you to provide you with the best Edpuzzle experience.\nMore specifically, this information is used to:<ul>\n<li> Provide and improve the Service, for example by developing new products and features.</li>\n<li> Respond to your requests for information or customer support.</li>\n<li> Customize the Service for you, and improve your experience with it.</li>\n<li> Send you information about new features and Edpuzzle products we believe you

\"Information Collected Automatically\" section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy.How long does Edpuzzle keep information about me?We store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, including those described above.\nAs a general rule, if your account is inactive for eighteen (18) months or more (meaning you have not logged into your account during that time), Edpuzzle will automatically delete your account.\nDeletion will affect any on-going paid subscriptions, which will be immediately cancelled.Note we may retain and use de-identified data (i.e., data which has been stripped off all information that can be used to identify a person) for purposes of research, improvement of our products and services, and/or the development of new products and services.\nWe may also have to retain some information after your account is deleted, to comply with legal obligations, to protect the safety and security of our community or our Service, or to prevent abuse of our Terms.\nIn case we keep copies or backups of personal information, such copies or backups will be kept for a maximum term of thirteen (13) months after the deletion of your account.\nRemember that you can delete your account at any time, as per the \"How Can I Delete my Account?\" section.\nIn addition to the policy above that applies to all users, we only keep a student\u2019s personal information while the student\u2019s account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it or need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms.Social Media Features/WidgetsThe Service may now or in the future include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and the Twitter Tweet button.\nThese social media features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website.\nYour interactions with these social media features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing each social media feature.\nIf you are not comfortable accessing such social media websites and using such social media features, please don\u2019t use them!Security MeasuresWill Edpuzzle share any information it collects?First and foremost, you should know that Edpuzzle does not sell or rent your, or your students' personal

that you voluntarily disclose to others - including other Edpuzzle users you interact with through the Service can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with.\nWe cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information.</li>\n<li>Third-party Integrations on Our Service: When, as a teacher, you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Service, they may receive information about what you post or share.\nFor example, when you invite others via Facebook or Twitter, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality, and information that you are sharing this from Edpuzzle.\nInformation collected by these apps, websites or integrated services is subject to their own terms and policies.</li>\n<li>Service Providers: We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf - we can\u2019t build everything ourselves, after all! We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security.\nPlease see here a list of the third parties we work with to provide the Service.\nGenerally, these service providers do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.\nAdditionally, these service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security

may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process.\nWe may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Edpuzzle, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service or other agreements.\nThis includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests.</li>\n<li>Sharing with Edpuzzle Companies: Over time, Edpuzzle may grow and reorganize.\nWe may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control by us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>Change of Control: In the event that all or a portion of Edpuzzle or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third party, personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third party.\nThis Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy).\nWe will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, and by email to your email address that you provided to us.\nIf you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company.\nIn the unlikely event that Edpuzzle goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your personal information, and will not sell it to any third party.</li>\n<li>With your Consent: Other than the cases above, we won\u2019t disclose your personal information for any purpose unless you consent to it.\nAdditionally,

as:<ul>\n<li>Security Protocols: We periodically review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to protect against unauthorized access to systems.</li>\n<li>Security Technology: We continually develop and implement features to keep your personal information safe - for example, when you enter any information anywhere on the Service, we

deal with a security breach?Although we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems as per best industry standards, no practices are 100% immune, and we can\u2019t guarantee the security of information.\nOutages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.<ul>\n<li>Initial Notice: Upon the discovery of a security breach that results in the unauthorized release, disclosure or acquisition of personal information, we will notify electronically, no later than 48 hours or 1 business day, such discovery to all affected users, schools and districts so that you can take appropriate protective steps.\nThis initial notice will include, to the extent known at the time of the notification, the date and time of the breach, its nature and extent, and the Service\u2019s plan to investigate and remediate the breach.\nSchools and districts will also be provided with a list of students and employees whose data was released, disclosed or acquired.</li>\n<li>Detailed Notification: Upon discovery

breach, including but not limited to the date and time of the breach.\nnature and extent of the breach.\nand measures taken to ensure that such breach does not occur in the future.\nSchools and districts will also be provided with the name(s) of student(s) and employee(s) whose data was released, disclosed or acquired.\nWe may also post a notice on our homepage (www.edpuzzle.com) and, depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.\nWhen it is not possible to provide all of the aforementioned information at the same time, we will provide you with the remaining information without undue further delay.</li>\n</ul>Both notifications will be written in plain language, will be titled \u201cNotice of Data Breach\u201d and will present the information described above under the following heading: \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d \u201cWhat Information Was Involved,\u201d \u201cWhat We Are Doing,\u201d \u201cWhat You Can Do\u201d and \u201cFor More Information\u201d.\nAdditional information may be provided as a supplement to the notice.Managing My InformationHow can I access and manage my personal information?Upon request and in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, we will grant you reasonable access to your personal information that is held by Edpuzzle.\nIn addition, we will take reasonable steps to permit you to correct, amend, or delete your personal information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate, incomplete or processed in violation of this Privacy Policy.\nIt is Edpuzzle's goal to provide you with easy access to any personal information we have collected about you.\nIf that information is incorrect, we also want to make sure to give you easy ways to update it, or delete it, unless we have to keep that information for legal purposes.<ul>\n<li>Accessing Your Information: To request access to the personal information we have about you on file, any school personnel can contact us at privacy@edpuzzle.com.\nIn some cases, we will not be able to guarantee complete access due to legal restrictions.\nfor example, you will not be allowed to access files that contain information about other users or information that is confidential to us.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to fulfill requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort or would be extremely impractical.</li>\n<li>Updating Your Information: You may update, correct, or delete some of your profile information or your preferences at any time by logging into your account on Edpuzzle and accessing your account settings page.\nYou may also, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us.\nTo that end, any school official can contact us at privacy@edpuzzle.com.\nPlease note that while your changes may be reflected promptly in active content, users that have previously accessed the content may still have access to old copies cached on their device or may have copied and stored your content.\nIn addition, we may retain a backup copy of the prior version for a limited period of time (maximum 13 months) or for legal purposes.</li>\n<li>Limitations: Without prejudice to the aforementioned, please note that we may limit or deny access to personal information (a) where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy.\n(b) where the legitimate rights of persons other than you would be violated or if necessary to safeguard important countervailing public interests (e.g., national security) or in other limited circumstances (e.g., disclosure would breach a legal privilege), and (c) where applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refuse to provide some or all of the personal information that we hold about you.\nIn addition, the personal information may have been destroyed, erased or made anonymous in accordance with our record retention obligations and practices.\nIn the event that we cannot provide you with access to your personal information, we will endeavour to inform you of the reasons why, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.</li>\n</ul>How can I delete my account?We hope you will love using Edpuzzle now and always.\nHowever, if for some reason you ever want to delete your account, any school official can do that at any time by contacting us at privacy@edpuzzle.com and we will proceed to delete the requested data within two (2) business days.\nIf you are a teacher using the Edpuzzle
