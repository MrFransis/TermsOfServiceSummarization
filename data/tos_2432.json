versions)</small>\n</p>\n<p>This privacy policy by Mojeek Limited, explains our stance on personal information, in regard to cookies, tracking, logging, data usage, contact information and any links to third parties.\n</p>\n<p>Mojeek follows a strict no tracking privacy policy, and it's quite simple, we don't track our users.\nIn fact, Mojeek was the first ever no tracking/privacy orientated search engine, as can be seen on archive.org and our original privacy policy from when Mojeek was just a side project.</p> Cookie Policy <p>By default and unless specifically agreed to, Mojeek doesn't place any cookies on your computer.\nIf Mojeek does require to place a cookie, your agreement will be requested, for example when setting personal preferences.\nAlso at any time, visiting this page will list what cookies Mojeek has on your computer, their contents, and an explanation of their values.\nFrom that page you can also instruct Mojeek to delete any cookie we have placed.</p> Tracking and Logging Policy <p>Mojeek doesn't implement any kind of specific user tracking, whether that be at the time of visit or subsequently via standard logs, which Mojeek does keep.\nThese logs contain the time of visit, page requested, possibly referral data, and located in a separate log browser information.\nIP addresses are not recorded, instead the IP address is replaced with a simple two letter code indicating the visitors country of origin.\nBy doing this, Mojeek removes any possibility of tracking or identifying any particular user.\nWe use a URL parameter to monitor if a campaign landing page visit results in a Mojeek search request.\nThis parameter is visible in the URL and is not used after the first search.</p> Data Usage <p>The remaining log data (country, time/date, page requested, referral data, and in a separate log browser data), which although now contains no identifiable data, would still in no situation whatsoever be sold or distributed to any third party vendors.\nThis data is kept private for the sole purpose of storing historical traffic volumes and country demographics of our visitors.\nWe may also use aggregate, non-personal search data to improve our results.</p> Contact Page Information <p>We only use your name and email address for the purpose of responding to contact requests that you have made.\nWe do not use these details for any other purpose.\nFurthermore, under GDPR, we respect that if you request and no longer give consent to us possessing your name and email address for contact reason, we will delete this data.</p> Other Websites <p>The Mojeek website contains links to other websites.\nThis privacy policy only applies to this website.\nWhen you proceed to other websites via our links, our privacy policy is void.</p> Third Parties <p>We do not outsource any development of Mojeek to third parties.\nall development is kept in-house.\nWe pride ourselves on limiting the number of third party products and services that Mojeek consumes.</p>\n<p>If you have any further questions please contact us, we'll be happy to answer any questions or concerns you may have.</p>\n<p>\n<small>View this policy with changes
