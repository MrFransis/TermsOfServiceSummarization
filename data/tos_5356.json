official University of California, Office of the President (UCOP) web sites, referred to as \"these sites,\" you agree to these terms of use.\nIf you do not agree to these terms of use, you may not post information to this site.\nThese sites are owned by The Regents of the University of California and operated by UCOP (referred to as \"UCOP,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\").\nWe reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these terms and conditions of use at any time.\nPlease check these terms and conditions periodically for changes.</p>\nCONDITIONS OF USE\n<p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is an Internet-based tool that uses standards for document presentation, graphical software and distributed computers to display and link images, text, motion and sound from resources in disparate locations throughout the world.\nThese features, plus its ease of use, make the Web an increasingly popular publishing and distribution medium.\nUCOP makes available Web servers, communication networks, and workstations to support and promote the mission of UC: teaching, research and public service.</p>\n<p>The following guidelines, policies, and laws emphasize the public nature of the Web and the responsibility of publishers and users.</p>\nAPPLICABLE POLICIES AND LAWS PERTAINING TO PUBLISHERS TO THE UCOP WEB SITE\n<p>Individuals and administrative units publishing information on UCOP Web servers or commercial servers funded by University budgets must abide by basic guidelines including all applicable University and campus policies and public laws.\nSupervisors shall apply necessary and appropriate corrective action whenever an employee fails to meet the required standards of conduct or performance.\nThough not exhaustive, the following section describes areas of particular relevance to the UCOP Web site.</p>\n<p>CRIMINAL AND CIVIL STATUTES: Web users are free to express themselves provided that they do not do anything to injure or harm others.\nUsers may not use the UCOP Web site for acts that violate laws.\nIf in doubt about appropriate use of the web, individuals are encouraged to obtain the advice of General Counsel.</p>\n<p>USE OF THE UNIVERSITY NAME, SEAL AND LOGO: No person or organization may use the University name in conjunction with advertising or to list the University as a user of any product or

being in the best interests of the University.\n(See Policy to Permit Use of the University's Name, and Policy to Permit Use of the Unofficial Seal.)</p>\n<p>PERSONAL FINANCIAL GAIN: Commercial activity for personal financial gain is not permitted.\nOnly those services and programs that have been approved or are recognized as being within the purview of the UC Board of Regents may be publicized on UCOP WWW sites.</p>\n<p>ADVERTISING: Web publishers may acknowledge donations or contributions by creating links to selected organizations/corporations that are major contributors to a campus or to a program sponsored by UCOP.\nLinks from a web site located on a UCOP server to any non-University site shall not imply University endorsement of the site's products or services.\nReferences to non-UCOP products, services, or organizations shall not imply University endorsement of such products, services, or organizations.</p>\n<p>APPROPRIATE USE OF UNIVERSITY RESOURCES: The University provides access to Internet resources for the conduct of University business.\nIncidental and occasional personal use is permitted within the University so long as such use does not disrupt or distract the conduct of University business (due to volume or frequency).\nIncidental and occasional personal use of Internet resources is subject to local

changes the underlying (copyright) issues.\nSee the Office of Technology Transfer advice on how to obtain permission to use copyrighted material (http://www.ucop.edu/ott/faculty/crothers.html) and University of California Policy on Copyright Ownership.</p>\n<p>Each UCOP home page must contain a statement that the content is the Property of The Regents of the University of
