Check it out here.\n</p>\n<p> You can follow the detailed instructions in the README file to set up a Google Cloud Platform account and host the app yourself.\nYou are also free to make any modifications you want.\nIf you'd like to contribute your code back to the project, please read the CONTRIBUTING file.\n</p>\n<p> Are the instructions too daunting?

<p> The wheel can display up to 1000 names at one time.\nWe added this limit, as the names become too small to read if more are displayed.\nIf you enter more than 1000 names in the text box, new names are randomly picked from the text box and put on the wheel as it spins.\nThe result is that all names in the text box have the same chance of winning,&nbsp;even if only 1000 are displayed on the wheel at any one time.\n</p>\n<p> Also, note that if you want to put thousands of names on the wheel, importing them from a Google Sheet (click <i>More</i>, then <i>Link Google Spreadsheet</i>) is faster than pasting them into the textbox.\nBut both approaches work.\n</p> Can the wheel display non-Latin characters? <p> Yes, just enter the characters you want in the text box.\nSee here for a wheel showing the word for water in Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Latin, Russian, Thai and Vietnamese.\n</p> Can the wheel display symbols instead of text? <p> Yes, you can copy special characters like smileys from other websites and paste them into the text box.\nThey will then appear on the wheel.\nSee this wheel for an example.\nEmojipedia is a great place to find characters to copy.\n</p> Can the wheel display images instead of text? <p> Yes, click the <i>\n</i>&nbsp;Add image button and you can upload an image.\nIf you write text next to the image in the text box, that text will appear on top of the image.\n</p>\n<p> Images with uniform background color work the best.\nEach slice with an image gets the same background color as the image.\nSome example wheels: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yes, no, maybe</li>\n<li>Cartoon monsters</li>\n<li>Gaming icons</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Is there a mobile app? <p> No, but the wheel has been optimized to run well on most mobile phones and tablets.\nAs a matter of fact, about half of the people who use the wheel do so from mobile phones or tablets.\n</p> Who has created the media?

Yes, it\u2019s quite random, within the limits of what computers can do.\nThe random number is created by the random number generator built into your browser\u2019s Javascript engine.\n</p> But I spun the wheel ten times and one entry came up more often than the others! <p> The wheel doesn't have memory, so past outcomes do not affect future results.\nIn this way it works like a coin toss.\nIf you toss a coin ten times, there is no guarantee that you will get exactly five heads and five tails.\nAs a matter of fact, there is only a 24.6% chance that you will get that outcome.\n</p>\n<p> If you spin the wheel several times, duplicate results are more common than your intuition might tell you.\nIf you have 10 entries on a wheel and spin it 5 times, there is a 70% chance that at least one entry will come up more than once.\n</p> When I click <i>\n</i>&nbsp;Shuffle is the shuffle really random? <p> Yes, the shuffle is random.\nIt uses the Durstenfeld algorithm, a computer-optimized variant of the Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle.\n</p>\n<p> Because the shuffle is random, there is no guarantee that all items move.\nFor example, if you have 5 items in the textbox and you shuffle them, 20% of the time the first item will remain in first place.\nThe same would be true if you manually shuffled a deck of five cards in a truly random way.\n</p> Can I rig the wheel? <p> No, but you can skew the odds by creating multiple entries with the same name.\nFor example, if you\u2019d like \u201cApple\u201d to come up twice as often as \u201cBanana\u201d, enter \u201cApple\u201d on two separate lines in the text box, and \u201cBanana\u201d only on one.\n</p> Can I change the names/items in my saved wheels? <p> Yes, edit the wheel, click <i>\n</i>&nbsp;Save at the top of the screen and pick the name of the wheel you want to overwrite in the dropdown box that appears.\n</p> Can I access my saved wheels from multiple devices? <p> Yes, you can access all of your saved wheels if you log in as the same user on the other device.\n</p> Can I delete a previously saved wheel? <p> Yes, click <i>\n</i>&nbsp;Open and then click <i>\n</i>&nbsp;Delete for the wheel that you want to delete.\n</p> How do I run an event where others can see me spinning the wheel live? <p> You have two options: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Record video from your screen and publish the video file on the event date and time.\nUse one of the screen recording software packages listed on this page.\n</li>\n<li> If your event will run on Facebook, you can stream video from your screen to your audience.\nYou can read more about Facebook video streaming here.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Can I record a video of spinning the wheel and then post it on my website/blog/social media? <p> You can use any screen capture software to record your screen when you spin the wheel.\nYou can read more about which screen recorder to pick, depending on your operating system: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Android</li>\n<li>Chromebook</li>\n<li>MacOS</li>\n<li>iOS</li>\n<li>Windows</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Can I share a wheel that I have built? <p> Yes, click <i>\n</i>&nbsp;Share and a link is created.\nYou can use email, social media, etc to share that link.\nAnyone who uses the link will see the wheel just the way it looks to you, including names, colors, and sound settings.\n</p> Can I turn off the sound effects? <p> Yes.\nClick <i>\n</i>&nbsp;Customize and a dialog box will appear where you can turn on or off the ticking sound made by the wheel, as well as the cheers sound effect played when the wheel stops.\n</p> Can I change the sound effects or music to my own? <p> Sorry, the app does not support this.\nYou can of course play music from another app or web page while you spin the wheel.\n</p> What are the sound effects? <p> Some of the sound effects were downloaded under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.\nThey have been recorded by: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tick: Notification 2_2 by Joao_Janz</li>\n<li>Cheers: Small Crowd Applause Sound by Yannick Lemieux</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> The other sound effects and music tracks have been
