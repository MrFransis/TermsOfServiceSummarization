processing Personal Data on Customer Properties.</strong> For Users who access the BridTV Technology from IP addresses in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process the elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are considered Personal Data under the GDPR.\nThe GDPR makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as \u201c<strong>data controllers</strong>\u201d) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as \u201c<strong>data processors</strong>\u201d).\nWhen we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our customers in order to provide our services to them, as is the case with BridTV Technology, we are a data processor and our customers, as the data controllers, have primary
