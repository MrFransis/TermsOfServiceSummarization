Services, you agree that SimpleLogin can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-01-18 17:59:22.314842", "updated_at": "2022-08-09 16:43:45.115928"}, {"id": 3574, "name": "Security Overview", "url": "https://simplelogin.io/security/", "xpath": "/html/body/main/div", "text": " Security Overview <p>Keeping your data safe and secure is a huge responsibility and a top priority for us.\nHere\u2019s how we make it happen.</p> Domains\n<p>SimpleLogin currently operates on the following domains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>simplelogin.io</li>\n<li>simplelogin.co</li>\n<li>simplelogin.fr</li>\n<li>slmail.me</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All domains implement the following standards:</p>\nDNSSEC\n<p>DNSSEC or Domain Name System Security Extensions is an extension of the DNS protocol that provides cryptographic assurance of the authenticity and integrity of responses.\nIt\u2019s intended as a defense against network attackers who are able to manipulate DNS to redirect their victims to servers of their choice.</p>\n<p>Without DNSSEC, a malicious hacker can point SimpleLogin MX record to their own server and receive emails sent to SimpleLogin servers.</p>\nCertification Authority Authorization (CAA)\n<p>CAA is a standard that allows SimpleLogin to restrict which Certificate Authorities (CA) are allowed to issue certificates for our domains.\nBy default, every public CA is allowed to issue certificates for <strong>any</strong> domain name in the public DNS, provided they validate control of that domain name.\nThat means that if there\u2019s a bug in any one of the many public CAs\u2019 validation processes, every domain name is potentially affected.\nThis has happened in the past, affecting Google, Windows Live among others.</p>\n<p>CAA provides a way for domain holders to reduce that risk.\nWithout CAA, someone could potentially obtain an unauthorized SSL certificate for SimpleLogin domains that could allow man-in-the-middle hacks.</p>\n<p>All SimpleLogin certificates are issued by Letsencrypt.</p>\nHardenize reports\n<p>Hardenize is a comprehensive security tool that provides assessment of web site network and security configuration.</p>\n<p>Here are Hardenize reports for our domains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>simplelogin.io</li>\n<li>simplelogin.fr</li>\n<li>simplelogin.co</li>\n<li>slmail.me</li>\n</ul> Mail Servers\n<p>Currently SimpleLogin has 2 mail servers located at</p>\n<ul>\n<li>mx1.simplelogin.co (Germany datacenter) and</li>\n<li>mx2.simplelogin.co (Netherlands datacenter).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our mail servers support the following security standards.</p>\nSPF\n<p>SPF(Sender Policy Framework) is a protocol that allows domain name owners to control which internet hosts are allowed to send email on their behalf.</p>\n<p>By default, only our mail servers can send emails on behalf of SimpleLogin.\nWe use the <strong>strictest</strong> SPF policy which is <code>-all</code>.\nWithout SPF, anyone can send emails that seem to come from SimpleLogin.</p>\nDKIM\n<p>DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail) is an email authentication technique that allows the receiver to check that an email was indeed sent and authorized by the owner of that domain.\nThis is done by giving the email a digital signature.</p>\n<p>All emails sent from SimpleLogin servers, including emails forwarded to your mailbox and emails sent from your mailbox are DKIM-signed.</p>\nDMARC\n<p>DMARC is an email-validation system.\nIt is designed to give email domain owners the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use, commonly known as email spoofing.</p>\n<p>Built around SPF and DKIM, a DMARC policy tells the receiving mail server what to do if neither of those authentication methods passes.</p>\n<p>SimpleLogin uses a strict DMARC policy that rejects emails that fail the SPF or DKIM check.</p>\nEmail TLS\n<p>Emails sent to our servers are encrypted using TLS 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3.\nNetwork attackers can\u2019t uncover what is being communicated, even when they can see all the traffic.</p>\nOthers\n<p>In addition to the above standards, SimpleLogin mail servers also implement the following recommended standards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MTA-STS</li>\n<li>TLS-RPT</li>\n<li>DANE</li>\n</ul> Web Servers\n<p>SimpleLogin currently has 2 web servers located at</p>\n<ul>\n<li>app.simplelogin.io (Germany datacenter) and</li>\n<li>mx2.simplelogin.co (Netherlands) as failover.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser.</p>\n<p>In addition, we also implement the following measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only support TLS v1.2 and v1.3.\nTLS v1.3 supports Forward Secrecy.</li>\n<li>Do not support previous versions (SSL, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) that are deprecated.</li>\n<li>DANE, HSTS, CSP, SRI, Expect CT, X-Frame-Options, XSS Protection</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We take reasonable security measures such as password protection, two-factor authentication for internal logins, and a whitelist of people who can deploy changes to the server.\nOur web app does not serve any 3rd party hosted JavaScript, except a script from Paddle, our payment processor.</p> Database &amp.\nFile Storage\n<p>Currently our database and file storage system are hosted in AWS Paris datacenter.\nThe database is using Postgresql, is encrypted at rest and backed up everyday.\nBackups older than 7 days are deleted.\nThe database is only accessible from our mail and web servers.</p>\n<p>File storage is based on S3 which is used to store user profile pictures and temporary bounced emails.\nThe bounced emails are deleted after 7 days.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-01-18 17:56:21.085597", "updated_at": "2021-02-03 22:47:14.177741"}, {"id": 3575, "name": "Privacy Policy", "url": "https://simplelogin.io/privacy/", "xpath": "//*[@id=\"content\"]/div", "text": " Privacy Policy <p>\n<strong>Last updated: 2022-04-22</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The privacy of your data \u2014 and it is your data, not ours! \u2014 is a big deal to us.\nIn this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why.\nhow your data is handled.\nand your rights to your data.</p>\n<p>In the following policy, SimpleLogin refers to the service offered by SimpleLogin SAS (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cWe\u201d) through the https://simplelogin.io website (the \u201cService\u201d).</p>\n<p>The Company is registered in France under the SIREN number 884302134.</p>\n<p>By visiting our website and using the Service provided here, you agree to the terms outlined in this privacy policy.</p> What we collect and why\nIdentity &amp.\naccess\n<p>In order to create an account, we require your email address.\nWe also give you the option to add a name and profile picture that displays in our products, but we do not normally look at or access these information.\nWe\u2019ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won\u2019t use your name in marketing statements without your permission either.</p>\nBilling information\n<p>When you pay for a SimpleLogin product, we ask for your credit card or PayPal and billing address.\nThat\u2019s so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices.\nYour credit card is passed directly to our payment processor and doesn\u2019t ever go through our servers.</p>\n<p>Currently we rely on Paddle to process credit card and PayPal transactions.\nPayments via our iOS app are processed by Apple.\nAnonymous cash, cryptocurrency payments and donations are accepted however.</p>\nVoluntary correspondence\n<p>When you write to us with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.</p> When we access or share your information\n<p>Our default practice is to not access your information.\nThe only times we\u2019ll ever access or share your info are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.\nIf at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.\nAccessing a customer\u2019s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort.\nWe have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us.\nWe do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process.\nIf we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When required under applicable law.\nIf the appropriate law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we share data, we have to comply.\nAnd unless we\u2019re legally prevented from it, we\u2019ll always inform you when such requests are made.\n<strong>We have never received a such request from the government</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> How we secure your data\n<p>All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser.\nThe database backups are also encrypted.\nMost data are not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.</p>\n<p>Our servers are provided by Proton, UpCloud and AWS.\nWe are using datacenters that are located in Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands and France.</p>\n<p>For more information on our server security, you can consult our security page.</p> When you delete your account\n<p>In SimpleLogin, you have the option to delete your account.\nYour account along with all your information are deleted immediately in the running database.\nAll your information will be purged from our system in maximum 30 days, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Database backups that are kept up to 14 days</li>\n<li>System logs that are deleted after 30 days</li>\n</ul> Information We Collect Automatically\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your emails: SimpleLogin does <strong>not</strong> store your emails.\nAn email is deleted from SimpleLogin server as soon as it reaches its destination, i.e.\nyour mailboxes for an email sent <strong>to</strong> your alias or your contact mailbox in case an email is sent <strong>from</strong> your alias.\nEmails that cannot be delivered are kept for 7 days so you can view and decide what to do with them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IP Logging: By default, SimpleLogin does <strong>not</strong> keep permanent IP logs.\nIP addresses can appear in Postfix (our MTA) and Nginx (our webserver) logs.\nLogs older than 7 days are deleted.\nHowever your IP address may be retained permanently if you are engaged in activities that breach our terms and conditions (spamming, DDoS attacks, brute force attacks, etc).\nThe legal basis of this processing is our legitimate interest to protect our service against nefarious activities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Native Applications: When you use our native applications such as iOS and Android apps, we (or the mobile app platform providers) may collect certain information in addition to the information mentioned elsewhere in this Policy.\nWe may use mobile analytics software to send crash information to our developers so that we can fix bugs rapidly.\nSome platforms (such as the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store) may also collect aggregate, anonymous statistics governed by the privacy policy and terms and conditions of the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.\nNone of the software on our apps will ever access or track any location-based information from your device at any time.\nAny personal data acquired during this process is anonymized.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analytics: We use Plausible, an open-source and privacy-aware web statistics service.\nPlausible does not collect any personal data or personally identifiable information (PII), does not use cookies and respect the privacy of the website visitors.\nMore info on Plausible privacy policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Account activity: Due to limitations of the SMTP protocol, we have access to the following email metadata: sender and recipient email addresses, the IP address incoming messages originated from, message subject, and message sent and received times.\nWe do NOT have access to encrypted message content but unencrypted messages sent from external providers to SimpleLogin are scanned for Spam and Viruses to pursue the legitimate interest of the protection of our users.\nWe also have access to the following records of account activity: number of messages sent, amount of storage space used, total number of messages, last login time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Third party services\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>hCaptcha: we use hCaptcha on our login and register page to protect SimpleLogin against bots.\nhCaptcha is a privacy focused captcha solution.\nIts privacy policy page is on https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CloudFlare: we use CloudFlare for managing our DNS records.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Zendesk: we use Zendesk for managing support tickets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Your Rights With Respect to Your Information\n<p>At SimpleLogin, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location.\nCurrently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) in the US.\nSimpleLogin recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law.\nThese rights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold.\nWe outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right of Access.</strong> This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Correction.</strong> You have the right to request correction of your personal information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Erasure / \u201cTo be Forgotten\u201d.</strong> This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers.\nFulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using SimpleLogin services because our applications may then no longer work.\nIn such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.\nTo identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information.\n(Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Object.</strong> You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Portability.</strong> You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</strong> You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes.\nThis right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> This right stems from the CCPA.\nWe do and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights.\nHowever, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right \u201cto be forgotten\u201d) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.\nIf you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at privacy@simplelogin.io or at SimpleLogin, 147 boulevard Henri Sellier, 92150 Suresnes, France.\nTo identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR, EU individuals should go to https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en.</p> Changes &amp.\nquestions\n<p>We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and
