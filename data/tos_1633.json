you.</p>\nColor images displayed on the website show approximate color only and are not intended to show exact paint color.\nVariations in monitors and monitor calibrations will affect the display of colors on the website.&nbsp.\nBenjamin Moore color formulations are prepared by Benjamin Moore.&nbsp.\nColor formulations for non-Benjamin Moore color formulations are calculated matches based on color paint chips (fandecks) from the original manufacturer of the color.\nSince all color chips are affected by age, light, heat, and mechanical coating processes, paint color chips may vary slightly in color, or finish from the actual paint in the container.\nDepending on clarity and depth of color, some colors may require multiple coats.\n&nbsp.\nMyPerfectColor limits its responsibility to the value of the paint sample can and will only replace or refund the sample can in the event of a mistake or extreme variation in color.\nWe recommend that once you decide on the color based on the paint color sample, that you bring the paint sample can with you to your local paint store and ask them to give you the color in the can.\nIf you simply ask for the paint based on the paint color name, then due to the potential for variation as explained above, you may end up with a color that is slightly different than your paint color sample.\nPlease always double check your paint colors before painting.\n&nbsp.\nMyPerfectColor.com will not accept any responsibility for any differences between the paint color sample and paint bought at a local paint store.\nIn the event of a mistake or an extreme difference in color, MyPerfectColor.com limits its responsibility to the value of the paint sample can.\n<br>\nSince all paint colors are custom made to order, all sales are final.\nNo returns or refunds will be offered.\nIn the event of a mistake, then please contact customer service for a replacement or refund.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Shipping Damage</strong>\n<br>\nMyPerfectColor will offer a full refund or replacement in the event of the paint being completely damaged and unusable during shipment.\nEven though MyPerfectColor uses appropriate packaging, paint can be damaged during shipment.\nHowever, if only a small amount of paint leaks or if cans get dented during shipment, the paint itself is undamaged and fully usable without any reduction in quality.\nIn these cases MyPerfectColor will not offer a refund or replacement.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Typographical Errors</strong>\n<br>\nIn the event that a&nbsp;Perfect Color Ventures,
