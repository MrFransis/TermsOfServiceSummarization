pre-litigation, pre-trial, at trial, on appeal, or otherwise), damages of any kind whatsoever (including consequential, compensatory, or punitive damages), or losses (whether known, unknown, asserted, non-asserted, fixed, conditional, or contingent) that arise from or relate to (i) the Services, including any and all contents, materials and software related thereto, and/or (ii) your use of the Services.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>20.4.\nInformal Dispute Resolution.\n</strong>If any Claim arises out of or relates to the Services or this Agreement, other than as may be provided herein, then you and Vercel agree to send notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Claim, along with a proposed resolution of it.\nVercel notice to you will be sent based on the most recent contact information that you provided Vercel.\nIf no such information exists or if such information is not current, Vercel has no obligation under this Section.\nFor a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, you and Vercel will engage in a dialog to attempt to resolve the Claim, though nothing will require either you or Vercel to resolve the Claim on terms with respect to which you and Vercel, in each of the parties' sole discretion, is not comfortable.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>20.5.\nApplicable Law.\n</strong>If you and Vercel cannot resolve a Claim, within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the notice, then you agrees that that any such Claim and all other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration relating to your use of the Services, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court.\nThe FAA, not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of such disputes, including the class action waiver below.\nHowever, you and Vercel agree that California state law or United States federal law shall apply to, and govern, as appropriate, any and all Claims or disputes arising between you and Vercel regarding this Agreement and the Services, whether arising or stated in contract, statute, common law, or any other legal theory, without regard to choice of law principles.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would.\nTHIS SECTION, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS ON BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE SERVICE.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>20.6.\nArbitration Request.\n</strong>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Vercel at 340 S Lemon Ave #4133, Walnut CA, 91789.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by JAMS's rules.\nThe arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California or at such other venue (and pursuant to such procedures) as is mutually agreed upon.\nYou can obtain JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows: JAMS: 800.352.5267 and https://www.jamsadr.com.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>20.7.\nFees.\n</strong>You and Vercel will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.\nbut if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Vercel to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section to be enforceable, then Vercel will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.\nArbitration rules may permit Vercel to recover attorneys' fees.\nVercel will not seek to recover attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>20.8.\nClass Action Waiver.\n</strong>YOU AND VERCEL EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nYou and Vercel each agree that such proceeding shall take solely by means of judicial reference pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 638.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>20.9.\nExceptions.\n</strong>Notwithstanding the agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, you or Vercel may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and moral rights, but not including privacy rights).\nYou or Vercel may also seek relief in small claims court for Claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.\nIn the event that the arbitration provisions above are found not to apply to you or to a particular Claim, either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the arbitration provisions or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that the venue for any such Claim or dispute is exclusively that of a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California.\nYou and Vercel agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating all such Claims or any other disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement or your use of the Services in the event that the arbitration provisions are found not to apply.\nIn such a case, should Vercel prevail in litigation against you to enforce its rights under this Agreement, Vercel shall be entitled to its costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees (whether incurred at or in preparation for trial, appeal or otherwise) incurred in resolving or settling the dispute, in addition to all other damages or awards to which Vercel may be entitled.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>20.10.\nRestrictions.\n</strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR VERCEL WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR VERCEL MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH HEREIN) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.\n\"Commencing\" means, as applicable: (i) by delivery of written notice as set forth herein.\n(ii) filing for arbitration with JAMS as set forth herein.\nor (iii) filing an action in state or federal court.\nThis provision will not apply to any legal action taken by Vercel to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any losses (or potential losses) relating to the Services, intellectual property rights of Vercel, and/or Vercel's provision of the Services.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>20.11.\nOpt-Out.\n</strong>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to: privacy@vercel.com with the subject line \"COMPANY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT\".\nThe notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate any disputes in accordance with this Agreement providing for binding arbitration.\nIf you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Vercel also will not be bound by them.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>21.\nPrivacy.\n</strong>Please visit

to resolve the dispute directly with the owner and/or administrator of a website hosted by Vercel after submitting a complaint to the DMCA agent designated by the owner and/or administrator, Vercel will follow the below procedures with respect to Notices of Infringement and Counter-Notifications.<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Prior to Filing a Notice of Infringement with Vercel:</i> An owner of a copyright should conduct its own due diligence to ascertain whether the owner in fact owns the copyright to an original work and whether the content on a website hosted by Vercel constitutes an unauthorized use of the content and/or infringes on the owner\u2019s copyright and must first have attempted to resolve the issue with the owner and/or administrator of the website.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Filing a Notice of Infringement:</i> If the copyright owner\u2019s investigation confirms that the owner actually owns the copyright and that the content posted on the website is unauthorized or infringes on the owner\u2019s copyright, the owner (hereinafter referred to as the \"<strong>Complainant</strong>\") should prepare and submit a Notice of Infringement to Vercel through the Designated Agent.\nThe Notice of Infringement should include all of the statutory requirements listed below and should be sufficiently detailed.\nUpon receipt of the Notice of Infringement, Vercel\u2019s Designated Agent will notify the owner(s) of the website of the copyright infringement claim in the Notice of Infringement.\nPlease note that Vercel does not monitor or police deployments and if a deployment or part thereof is taken offline, it is possible that a website owner may spin up a new deployment to push to their website and that deployment may have similar issues (and may be subject to a new DMCA complaint).</li>\n<li>\n<i>Resolving the Notice of Infringement:</i>\n<ul>\n<li>To the extent that the Notice of Infringement properly alleges that the entirety of the contents or materials of a website hosted by Vercel infringe on the Complainant\u2019s copyright, Vercel will disable the deployment at issue, in its entirety, and will take the deployment offline.</li>\n<li>Since Vercel is unable to disable access or to remove specific content from its customers\u2019 public websites and can only address deployments made through the Vercel Platform, in the event that the Notice of Infringement properly alleges that only portions of the website\u2019s content infringes the copyrights of the Complainant, Vercel will disable the specific content from the deployment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<i>Filing a Counter-Notification:</i> Where allegedly infringing material was removed (or access to it disabled) in response to a Notice of Infringement, the owner(s) of the website should consult with a professional and/or lawyer about their options and circumstances.\nIf you, as the owner(s) of the website, believe that material you posted on a website deployed through the Vercel Platform was wrongfully removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you can file a Counter-Notification with Vercel 908\\3764446.2 through its Designated Agent.\nVercel will then promptly provide a copy of the Counter- Notification to the Complainant who originally filed the Notice of Infringement.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Copyright Owner\u2019s Right to File a Lawsuit:</i> Vercel will promptly replace the removed material or restore access to it within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days after receiving the Counter-Notification from the owner(s) of the website, unless Vercel\u2019s Designated Agent receives notice from the Complainant that it has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the owner(s) of the website from engaging in infringing activity pursuant to Section 512(g)(2)(b) of the DMCA.</li>\n</ul>\n</small>\n<b>Notice of Infringement</b>\n<small>Vercel will promptly respond to Notices of Infringement that comply with applicable laws and Vercel\u2019s DMCA Policy.\nIn the event you believe any materials accessible on or from a website hosted by Vercel infringe your copyright, you may request removal of those allegedly infringing materials (or access to them) by submitting a written notification to Vercel\u2019s copyright agent designated below.</small>\n<small>Pursuant to Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, the written notice must include the following:<ul>\n<li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>\n<li>A statement by you that you first attempted to resolve the issue with the website owner or administrator.</li>\n<li>Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed (or a representative list of works if the claim involves multiple works), including copies of, or references to, URL\u2019s where your copyrighted works reside so that we can verify that you are the copyright owner.</li>\n<li>Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow Vercel to locate that material.</li>\n<li>Adequate information by which Vercel can contact you (including your name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address).</li>\n<li>A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials is unauthorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>\n<li>A statement that the information in the Notice of Infringement is accurate.</li>\n<li>A statement, under penalty of perjury that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>\n</ul>\n</small>\n<small>Vercel\u2019s designated copyright agent (\u201c<strong>Designated Agent</strong>\u201d) to receive DMCA Notices of Infringement and Counter-Notifications (as defined below) is:</small>\n<small>Vercel Inc.<br>Attn: DMCA/dmca@vercel.com<br>330 S Lemon Ave #4133<br>Walnut, CA 91789<br>Phone: 5592887060<br>dmca@vercel.com</small>\n<small>If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your Notice of Infringement may not be effective.\nFurthermore, if you knowingly and materially misrepresent that the material on the website hosted by Vercel is infringing your copyright, you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys\u2019 fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.</small>\n<b>Counter-Notification</b>\n<small>If you are a Vercel customer and believe that material you posted on a website deployed through the Vercel Platform was wrongfully removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you can file a counter-notification with Vercel (\u201c<strong>Counter-Notification</strong>\u201d), pursuant to Section 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA, by submitting written notification to our Designated Agent identified above.</small>\n<small>Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter-Notification must substantially include the following:<ul>\n<li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>\n<li>An identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, along with the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access was disabled.</li>\n<li>Adequate information by which Vercel can contact you (including, your name, mailing address, telephone number, and e-mail address).</li>\n<li>A statement by you, under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</li>\n<li>A statement by you that you will consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district that your address is located (or if you reside outside the USA, for any judicial district in which the website may be found) and that you will accept service of process from the person (or that person\u2019s agent) who provided Vercel with the Notice of Infringement at issue.</li>\n</ul>\n</small>\n<small>Vercel\u2019s designee to receive Counter-Notifications is the Designated Agent listed above.</small>\n<small>Please note that the DMCA allows Vercel to restore the removed content if the party filing the original Notice of Infringement does not file a court action against you within ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days of receiving the copy of your Counter-Notification.\nYou should also be aware that if you knowingly and materially misrepresent that the material on the website hosted by Vercel was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys\u2019 fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.</small>\n<b>Repeat Offenders</b>\n<small>It is Vercel\u2019s policy, in certain circumstances and in its sole discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of customers who are repeat infringers upon the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of others.</small>\n<p>Last update: June 25th, 2021</p>", "created_at": "2022-06-25 20:02:02.077268", "updated_at": "2022-06-25 20:02:10.32591"},

receive:</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Directly</strong> from you when you provide it to us, such as in connection with our Services or Event registrations.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Indirectly</strong>, through automated technologies such as cookies, or from third parties.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>On behalf of our Customers</strong>, when we process the personal data of their End Users as part of our Services.</small>\n<small>This is all explained in more detail below.</small>\n<b>Information We Collect Directly From You</b>\n<small>You can generally visit our Site without having to submit any personal information.\nIf you request more information, or sign up for our Services, we will collect personal information as follows.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Account Information.\n</strong>When you register for a Vercel customer account (including when you join for free) we request your <em>email address</em> and, on occasion, your telephone number.\nOnce your email and telephone number have been confirmed by our systems and you have successfully signed up, we will ask you to create a username and optionally upload a profile picture.\nWe also provide you the option of submitting your name, company name and location.\nThis information is your \"Account Information\" for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\nAccount Information is required to identify you as a Customer and permit you to access your account(s).\nBy voluntarily providing us with such Account Information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal data or otherwise have the requisite consent to provide it to us.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Customer Payment Information.\n</strong>You are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to our Services.\nWhen you sign up for one of our paid Services, you must provide billing information.\nThe information you will need to submit depends on which billing method you choose.\nIn order to process your payment Information, we use PCI-compliant third-party processors, as explained in the Section on \"Payment Processing\" below.\nThis information is processed by our payment service provider and we receive a confirmation of payment, which we then associate with your Account Information and any relevant transactions.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Event Attendee Information.\n</strong>We may collect personal information such as name, address, phone number and email address when participants register for or attend a sponsored Event or other events at which Vercel (and/or its affiliates or representatives) may be present.\nWhat information is collected depends on the Event, but any personal information that Vercel receives in connection with an Event is processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Optional Information.\n</strong>We may also ask you to submit personal information if you choose to use interactive features of the Platform, including participation in surveys, promotions, requesting customer support, or otherwise communicating with us.</small>\n<b>Information We Collect Indirectly</b>\n<b>Device and Usage Information</b>\n<small>When you download, use or interact with the Site, even if you do not have an account, we, or authorized third parties engaged by us, may automatically collect information about your use of the Site via your device, some of which is considered personal information.\n\"Device and Usage Information\" that we collect consists of:</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Information About your Device: </strong>information about the devices and software you use to access the Site \u2014 primarily the internet browser or mobile device that you use, the website or source that linked or referred you to the Site, your IP address or device ID (or other persistent identifier that uniquely identifies your computer or mobile device on the Internet), the operating system of your computer or mobile device, device screen size, and other similar technical information.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Usage Information: </strong>information about your interactions with the Platform, including access dates and times, hardware and software information, device event information, log data, crash data, cookie data.\nThis information allows us to understand the screens that you view, how you've used the Platform (which may include administrative and support communications with us), and other actions on the Platforms.\nWe, or authorized third parties, automatically collect log data when you access and use the Platform, even if you have not created an account or logged in.\nWe use this information to administer and improve the Services, analyze trends, track users' use of the Platform, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</small>\n<small>Note that Device and Usage Information is collected from our community boards, as well as from our Customers' End Users who visit our Customers' websites hosted by Vercel or that use our Services.</small>\n<small>Based on Device and Usage Information, we are also able to determine general location information (\"Location Information\").</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Location Information: </strong>we use a third-party database to map the general location to which each IP address corresponds (\"Location Information\").\nThe Location Information that is mapped from an IP address is limited to country and city \u2013 we do not identify precise location.\nWe use Location Information in order to more effectively provide our Services to our Customers.\nIn addition, as part of our Services, we also share Location Information (based on End Users\u2019 IP addresses) to our Customers, so that they may also more effectively provide their products and services to their End Users.</small>\n<b>Cookies and Similar Technologies</b>\n<small>Vercel uses cookies and similar technologies.\nThrough our use of cookies (and similar technologies), we or authorized third parties collect some Device and Usage Information.\nSome cookies are necessary to make the Site and our content available to you, while others are meant to improve the Site and enable us to analyze and measure audience and traffic.\nFor more information on our use of cookies and the data that they collect, see our Cookie Policy.</small>\n<b>Information from Third Parties</b>\n<small>In some instances, we process personal information from third parties, which consists of data from our partners, such as transactional data from providers of payment services, or information from third parties with whom we host or sponsor Events.\nIn all such cases, individuals are informed of our processing activities and/or able to choose certain preferences at the time of collection.\nFrom time to time, we may combine information we collect as described above with personal information we obtain from third parties.\nFor example, we may combine information entered through a Vercel sales submission with information we receive from a third-party sales intelligence platform to enhance our ability to market our Services to Customers or potential Customers.</small>\n<b>Information We Process on Behalf of Our Customers</b>\n<small>As noted above, we deploy and host websites and provide other analytics tools for our Customers.\nThese Customers may collect personal information from their End Users in connection with the products or services that they offer to End Users.\nBecause we host our Customers' websites and provide other analytics tools, we process End Users' information when they use our Customers' websites, web applications, and APIs.\nThis information may also include, but is not limited to, IP addresses, system configuration information, and other information about traffic to and from Customers' websites (collectively, the \"Log Data\"), as well as Location Information derived from IP addresses.\nWe do not, however, collect or process End Users\u2019 IP addresses through the use of our analytics Services.\nAll of this information is stored on our Platform as part of our Services, but Customers are responsible for the content transmitted across our network (e.g., images, written content, graphics, etc.), as well as any personal information they collect.\nCustomers are also solely responsible for notifying their End Users of their personal information collection, use, and disclosure.\nWith respect to Log Data, we collect and use Log Data to operate, maintain, and improve our Services in performance of our obligations under our Customer agreements.\nFor example, Log Data can help us to detect new threats, identify malicious third parties, and provide more robust security protection for our Customers.\nIt also helps us with improving our Platform, as explained below.</small>\n<b>Analytics</b>\n<small>With the Device and Usage Information collected by our third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, as well as Log Data, we generate and process aggregated information, such as statistical or demographic data.\nAggregated Information may be derived from personal data, but may not considered personal data if it does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity.\nFor example, we may track the total number of visitors to our Platform, or review Log Data, or track the number of visitors to each page of our Site.\nWe aggregate this data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific feature of the Platform and analyze this data for trends and statistics.</small>\n<small>However, if we or our third-party analytics service providers combine or connect Aggregated Information with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data, which will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nPlease see our Cookie Policy for more information.</small>\n<b>Payment Processing</b>\n<small>We do not directly collect your payment information and we do not store your payment information.\nWe use third-party, PCI-compliant, payment processors, which collect payment

agents, contractors, or service providers who are hired to perform services on our behalf.\nThese companies do things to help us provide the Platform, and in some cases collect information directly, for example as explained in Payment Processing above.\nBelow is an illustrative list of functions for which we may use third-party service providers:</small>\n<small>\n<ul>\n<li>Hosting and content

or business units.\nAlternatively, we may sell businesses or business units, merge with other entities and/or sell assets or stock, in some cases as part of a reorganization or liquidation in bankruptcy.\nAs part of these transactions, we may transfer your personal information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Vercel participates, or to a purchaser or acquirer of all or a portion of Vercel's assets, bankruptcy included.</small>\n<b>Vercel Customers</b>\n<small>When we act on behalf of our Customers (as a data processor or service provider), we may provide End Users' personal information to our Customers in order to comply with their requests, End Users' requests and/or regulator requests, among others.</small>\n<small>Occasionally, we will provide our Customers with aggregated information that does not identify End Users directly, in order to provide information about usage, demographics (such as location) or other general information.</small>\n<b>Event Sponsors</b>\n<small>If you are an Event Attendee that has registered for an Event with Vercel, such as the Next.js conference, we will provide your personal information to the Event sponsors.\nSuch Event sponsors may use your personal information for their own direct marketing purposes and otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Event sponsors\u2019 own privacy policies.</small>\n<b>Anonymized Information</b>\n<small>We share aggregated, automatically-collected or otherwise non-personal information with third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with reporting obligations.\n(ii) for business or marketing purposes.\n(iii) to assist us and other parties in understanding our users' interests, habits and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, marketing and/or functionality available through the Platform.\nWe do not share personal information about you in this case.</small>\n<b>Legal Obligations and Security</b>\n<small>In addition, Vercel will preserve or disclose your personal information in limited circumstances (other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy), including: (i) with your consent.\n(ii) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena, warrant or other judicial or administrative order (as further explained below).\n(iii) to protect the safety of any person and to protect the safety or security of our Platform or to prevent spam, abuse, or other malicious activity of actors with respect to the Platform.\nor (iv) to protect our rights or property or the rights or property of those who use the Platform.</small>\n<small>If we are required to disclose personal information by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena, warrant or other judicial or administrative order, our policy is to respond to requests that are properly issued by law enforcement within the United States or via mutual legal assistance mechanism (such as a treaty).\nNote that if we receive information that provides us with a good faith belief that there is an exigent emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to a person, we may provide information to law enforcement trying to prevent or mitigate the danger (if we have it), to be determined on a case-by-case basis.</small>\n<b>Links to Third Party Sites</b>\n<small>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Platform.\nThe Platform may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by Vercel (\"Third Party Sites\").\nThe policies and procedures we describe here do not apply to Third Party Sites, and links to such Third Party Sites on the Platform do not imply that Vercel endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites.\nWe suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</small>\n<b>What You Should Know about Domain Registration</b>\n<small>Note that if you purchase a domain name from Vercel, we may be required to collect registrant data for the purposes of domain registration and listing via the WHOIS protocol.\nWe may also be required to share this with ICANN, the relevant registrars and other such providers with whom we contract in order to provide our domain name services, as well as when served with a legitimate request from third parties.\nRegistration data may include the domain name, registrant name and contact information, and information on the domain name server.\nSuch registration data may be made publicly available by ICANN.</small>\n<b>\"Do Not Track\"</b>\n<small>Vercel does not respond to Do Not Track (\"DNT\") browser signals.\nFor more information on DNT settings generally, please visit https://allaboutdnt.com.</small>\n<b>How to Change Your Communication Preferences</b>\n<small>To keep your information accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as specified below.\nWe will take reasonable steps to update any information in our possession that you have previously submitted via the Platform.\nNote that you may also manage your communications preferences and the receipt of any commercial communication by clicking the \"unsubscribe\" link included at the bottom of all emails from Vercel.\nYou may also adjust your preferences through your account settings if you have a Vercel account, or send an email to privacy@vercel.com.</small>\n<b>Access and Accuracy</b>\n<small>Vercel uses reasonable efforts to keep your personal information accurate.\nWe will provide you with online access to your personal information so that you may review, update or correct personal information that we hold.</small>\n<small>Note that in order to protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections.\nTo access your personal information, please visit the relevant account management sections of our Platform.\nIf you cannot access your personal information on the Platform, please send an email to privacy@vercel.com.</small>\n<b>How Long Do We Keep Your Personal information?</b>\n<b>General Retention Periods</b>\n<small>We use the following criteria to determine our retention periods:<ul>\n<li>The amount, nature and sensitivity of your information;</li>\n<li>The reasons for which we collect and process the personal data;</li>\n<li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide you with access to our Platform.\nand</li>\n<li>applicable legal requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n</small>\n<small>We retain personal information for as long as needed to provide our Services.\nNote, however, that with respect to our Customers with active accounts, we may retain certain essential account information, but otherwise regularly delete other information that is less essential to the provision of our Services in order to minimize our storage of data.</small>\n<small>We also will retain personal information that we've collected from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).\nAdditionally, we cannot delete information when it is needed for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (also known as a \"litigation hold\").\nIn this case, the information must be retained as long as needed for exercising respective potential legal claims.</small>\n<small>When we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</small>\n<small>For any questions about data retention, please contact privacy@vercel.com.</small>\n<b>Anonymization</b>\n<small>In some instances, we may choose to anonymize your personal data instead of deleting it, for statistical use, for instance.\nWhen we choose to anonymize, we make sure that there is no way that the personal data can be linked back to you or any specific user.</small>\n<b>Data Security And Integrity</b>\n<small>We take steps that are reasonably necessary to securely provide our Platform.\nWe have put in place reasonably appropriate security measures designed to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed.\nWe limit access to personal data only to those employees, agents, contractors and the third parties who have a business need-to-know.</small>\n<small>We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach.\nIf required, we will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach.\nWe also require those parties to whom we transfer your personal information to provide acceptable standards of security.</small>\n<small>Notwithstanding, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free.\nIn particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure.\nTherefore, take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.\nFor any questions about the security of your information, please contact privacy@vercel.com.</small>\n<b>Your California Privacy Rights</b>\n<small>If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request in writing a list of the categories of personal information relating third parties to which we have disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes.\nTo make such a request, please contact us at privacy@vercel.com.</small>\n<b>Notice to Nevada Consumers</b>\n<small>We do not sell your personal information within the scope of, and according to the defined meaning of, a \"sale\" under NRS 603A.</small>\n<b>International Transfers</b>\n<small>Vercel is a United States Delaware corporation with primarily storage of your information in the United States and the EEA.\nTo facilitate our global operations, we may process personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which Vercel has operations, in order to provide the Platform.</small>\n<small>\n<b>If you are accessing or using our Platform or otherwise providing personal information to us, you are agreeing and consenting to the processing of your personal information in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate.</b>\n</small>\n<small>If you are a Customer, you are responsible for informing your End Users of how and where their personal data will be processed at the time of collection.</small>\n<small>Vercel complies with the EU-U.S.\nand Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield framework (\"Privacy Shield\") as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce in connection with the collection, use, and retention of certain personal data transferred from the EEA or the UK and Switzerland to the United States.\nAlthough the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield has been ruled invalid for the transfer of personal data, where personal information has already been transferred to the U.S.\non the basis of the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield prior to being held invalid, we will continue to protect personal information from the EEA or the UK according to the standards of the Privacy Shield and applicable EU law.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, or to view our certification, please see https://www.privacyshield.gov.</small>\n<small>In addition to relying on our Privacy Shield certification with respect to personal data transferred from the EEA or the UK for the time period in which the EU-US Privacy Shield was valid or for data that we receive from Switzerland, Vercel relies on other mechanisms, including the Standard Contractual Clauses and consent, to transfer personal data that we receive from the EEA or the UK to Vercel in the United States.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Security.\n</strong>We maintain security measures to protect personal data as described in the section above entitled \"Data Security And Integrity\".</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Access.\n</strong>Individuals in the EEA, the UK and Switzerland have certain rights to access, correct, amend, or delete personal data.\nPlease see the section below entitled \"Additional Information for Users in the EEA and the UK.\" for more information on the rights of users in the EEA and the UK (and, to the extent applicable, users in Switzerland).\nNote that when we process End Users' personal data as a data processor on behalf of our Customers, we will process such requests pursuant to our contract with our customer and our customers' instructions.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Recourse, Enforcement, Liability.\n</strong>With respect to personal data collected from individuals in the EEA and the UK (while Privacy Shield was in place) or Switzerland, , Vercel commits to resolve complaints about our processing of your personal data as set forth in the principles under Privacy Shield.\nIndividuals in the EEA and the UK and Switzerland with inquiries or complaints should first contact Vercel by email at privacy@vercel.com or via postal mail at 340 S Lemon Ave #4133, Walnut, CA 91789, with the subject \"Attention: Privacy Shield\".\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to an alternative dispute resolution provider.\nIf you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.\nFor additional information, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction.\nWe are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Frameworks.</small>\n<b>Additional Information for Users in the EEA and the UK.</b>\n<small>\n<strong>If the GDPR applies to you because you are in the EEA or the UK</strong>, you have certain rights in relation to your personal data:</small>\n<small>\n<strong>The right to be informed: </strong>our obligation to inform you that we process your personal data (and that's what we're doing in this Privacy Policy);</small>\n<small>\n<strong>The right of access: </strong>your right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you (also known as a 'data subject access request');</small>\n<small>\n<strong>The right of rectification: </strong> your right to request that we correct personal data about you if it is incomplete or inaccurate (though we generally recommend first making any changes in your Account Settings);</small>\n<small>\n<strong>The right to erasure (also known as the 'right to be forgotten'): </strong>\n<em>under certain circumstances</em>, you may ask us to delete the personal data we have about you (unless it remains necessary for us to continue processing your personal data for a legitimate business need or to comply with a legal obligation as permitted under the GDPR, in which case we will inform you);</small>\n<small>\n<strong>The right to restrict processing: </strong>your right, <em>under certain circumstances</em>, to ask us to suspend our processing of your personal data;</small>\n<small>\n<strong>The right to data portability: </strong>your right to ask us for a copy of your personal data in a common format (for example, a .csv file);</small>\n<small>\n<strong>The right to object: </strong>your right to object to us processing your personal data (for example, if you object to us processing your data for direct marketing).\nand</small>\n<small>\n<strong>Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling: </strong>our obligation to be transparent about any profiling we do, or any automated decision-making.</small>\n<small>These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them.</small>\n<b>Customers, Site Visitors and Event Attendees in the EEA or the UK.</b>\n<small>If you are located in the EEA or the UK and you are a Customer, Site Visitor or Event Attendee, and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, you may contact us at privacy@vercel.com using the term \"DSR\" as your email subject line.</small>\n<small>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\nAlternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request under those circumstances.</small>\n<small>\n<strong>If we cannot reasonably verify your identity, we will not be able to comply with your request(s).</strong> We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity.\nThis is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nNote that this is especially true when you engage a third party to assist you in exercising your rights.</small>\n<small>We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month.\nOccasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated as required by law.\nIn addition, we will always balance your rights against those of other data subjects in connection with any requests, and in some cases this may require us to redact our responses or deny a request.</small>\n<small>Customers also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at https://vercel.com.\nWe ask that Customers use this option as a first step when rectifying information.</small>\n<small>If you no longer wish to receive our marketing/promotional information, we remind you that you may withdraw your consent to direct marketing at any time directly from the unsubscribe link included in each electronic marketing message we send to you.\nIf you do so, we will promptly update our databases, and will take all reasonable steps to meet your request at the earliest possible opportunity, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of providing our Services.</small>\n<small>Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence.\nWe would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority, so please contact us directly first.</small>\n<b>End Users in the EEA or the UK.</b>\n<small>Vercel has no direct relationship with End Users.\n<strong>Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their End Users, and this includes handling all data subject requests.</strong> We rely on our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements and respond directly to End Users when End Users wish to exercise the rights set forth above.\nHowever, if an End User sends a request to Vercel to access, correct, update, or delete his/her information, or no longer wishes to be contacted by a Customer that uses our Services, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer's website(s) with which he/she interacted directly, and cooperate with our Customers as required by applicable law in order to ensure that our Customers satisfy their End Users' requests.</small>\n<b>European Representative</b>\n<small>Pursuant to Article 27 of the General Data Protection Regulation
