Info&nbsp;link on the bottom of the Website page where we collect Information,.\nor email us at&nbsp;help@myprivacyrequest.com.&nbsp.\nTo prevent an unauthorized third party from accessing or making decisions regarding a user\u2019s Information, we verify all requests to exercise these rights (a verifiable consumer request).\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or abusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In general, we will verify a request by matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the Information we already have for the user.&nbsp.\nIf we cannot verify the user using the foregoing method, we may request additional information which we will not retain or use for any other purpose.&nbsp;<br>For all verifiable consumer requests, we strive to respond within forty-five (45) days of receipt.&nbsp.\nIf we require additional time, which can be up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate, we will provide written notice.&nbsp.\nAny disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt and will be delivered electronically in a secure fashion.&nbsp.\nIf, for some reason, we cannot fulfill or comply with your request, our response will explain that decision.&nbsp;<br>Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold.&nbsp.\nWhile users have the right to request different levels of disclosure regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of Information, we have elected to treat all requests from California residents as an

using the methods described above.&nbsp;<br>While our agreements with third parties to whom we sell or disclose Information prohibit the further sale or use beyond the scope of our agreement with them, if a California user opts-out, we will notify all third parties to whom we have sold or disclosed the California user\u2019s Information within the previous 90 days and remind them not to further sell the Information.&nbsp.\nWe will not ask a California user who has opted out to re-opt-in for one year after the California user opts-out.&nbsp.\nIf the user requests a transaction with us

two-step process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Deletion of Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have the right to request that we delete any of your Information that we collected from you, subject to certain

exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>We may decline to process your deletion request if the Information is necessary for us or our service providers, vendors or other applicable third parties for a number of reasons.&nbsp.\nThe following are some of the reasons we may decline your deletion request:&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the Information or provide the

the mandatory arbitration provision below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>AGREEMENT.\nCHOICE OF LAW/JURISDICTION AND VENUE&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that these Terms &amp.\nConditions constitute the agreement between us and that New York law controls, without regard to conflicts of law provisions.&nbsp.\nAny dispute that is not resolved by arbitration and proceeds in a state or federal court will be adjudicated in a court in the state of New York.&nbsp.\nYou expressly waive any defense or objection to venue or personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<b>ARBITRATION/DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b>\n</p>\n<p>You agree to arbitrate any and all claims arising out of or related to the Agreement.&nbsp.\nIf you have a dispute concerning any aspect of the Agreement, including without limitation, your participation in a Promotion, entitlement to an Incentive or a telemarketing call or SMS/text message that you received from us or a Marketing Partner, you should first contact customer support on the Site or complete a customer support ticket.&nbsp.\nWe will attempt to resolve the matter to your satisfaction within thirty (30) days of our receipt of a customer support ticket.&nbsp.\nWe may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer during this process.&nbsp.\nIf we provide you with a final written settlement offer and you don't accept it, if we can't otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, or if you choose to skip this step, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in the county where you live by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration online by following the instructions at https://apps.adr.org/webfile/.</p>\n<p>An AAA arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute or claims that you may have with us\u2014and our Marketing Partners who are third-party beneficiaries of the mandatory arbitration provision\u2014arising out of or related to the Agreement.&nbsp.\nMatters subject to mandatory arbitration include, without limitation, whether this Arbitration/Dispute Resolution provision applies to your particular claim or dispute, and any claim that all or any part of the Agreement, including this provision, are/is unenforceable.&nbsp.\nIf the claim is against us, you will need our mailing address to file online.&nbsp.\nTo obtain our mailing address, contact us by clicking here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Either party may submit the dispute for resolution by arbitration at a location reasonably convenient to both parties.&nbsp.\nIf either party files for arbitration, it will be conducted in accordance with the then current AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>If you proceed to arbitration against us, you will pay all AAA filing fees and we will pay for all administration and arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).&nbsp.\nFor claims brought by you of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable relief, including injunctive relief.&nbsp.\nAny award will be final and conclusive to the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp.\nIf you initiate arbitration against us and the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our final written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then we will pay you a minimum recovery of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), plus we will reimburse any reasonable expenses incurred by your attorney, if any, including fees reasonably accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration.&nbsp.\nAlthough under some laws we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we agree that we will not seek such an award from you.&nbsp.\nYou and your attorneys are not required to keep the results of the arbitration confidential.&nbsp.\nYou agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in such a suit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Class Action Waiver.&nbsp;</b> The arbitration provision contained in these Terms &amp.\nConditions does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above.&nbsp.\nThis provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Exceptions to Mandatory Arbitration.&nbsp;</b> There are two narrow exceptions to mandatory arbitration.&nbsp.\nFirst, you may opt-out of the Arbitration/Dispute Resolution provision by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first register on the Site.&nbsp.\nTo obtain our mailing address, contact us by clicking here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, you may choose to pursue your dispute or claim in Small Claims Court rather than by arbitration but only if your dispute or claim qualifies for Small Claims Court in a location where jurisdiction and venue over both you and APC is proper.</p>\n<p>Other than these two exceptions, you must arbitrate any claims as provided above.</p>\n<p>\n<b>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, VIA YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS, YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AS WELL AS YOUR RIGHT TO BRING, JOIN OR PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT OR MULTI-PARTY ARBITRATION
