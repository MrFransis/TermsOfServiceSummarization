present General Terms, regardless of the form in which they are presented (on paper or electronically, e.g.\nthrough the ArvanCloud website).\n</p>\n<p> 1.2.\nArvanCloud is a brand of Softqloud GmbH: a duly established company under German law.\n</p>\n<p> 1.3.\nCustomer: party to whom ArvanCloud\u2019s offer has been directed, with whom ArvanCloud has reached an agreement or for whom the legal act takes place, on grounds of which Products or Services are delivered to this party.\n</p>\n<p> 1.4.\nProducts: all moving things which are the object of any offer, agreement or other legal act in the frame of the relationship between ArvanCloud and the Customer.\n</p>\n<p> 1.5.\nServices: all work and other activities which are the object of any offer, agreement or other legal act in the frame of the relationship between ArvanCloud and the Customer.\n</p>\n<p> 1.6.\nAgreement: any reciprocal acceptation, confirmed in writing or through email, with respect to ArvanCloud\u2019s Services.\nOrders placed electronically are explicitly included herein.\n</p> 2.\nApplicability of the General Terms <p> 2.1.\nThe General Terms are applicable to and are part of all offers, agreements and other legal acts, regardless of the way in which they have been made (orally, in writing, electronically or in any other form), in the frame of delivery by ArvanCloud of Products and/or Services to or for the Customer.\n</p>\n<p> 2.2.\nThe General Terms are also applicable to Products and/or Services ArvanCloud obtained from a third party and delivered (be it with or without having treated them before delivery) to the Customer as well as to Products and/or Services delivered to the Customer for ArvanCloud by a third party, as a result of the execution of an offer, agreement or any other legal act.\n</p>\n<p> 2.3.\nDerogations of the General Terms are only valid providing both ArvanCloud and the Customer have explicitly agreed to them in writing.\n</p>\n<p> 2.4.\nArvanCloud explicitly rejects the applicability of possible General Terms (of purchase) belonging to the Customer.\n</p>\n<p> 2.5.\nIn the event that a condition should become or should be declared void, the remaining conditions of the General Terms shall remain in full effect.\nArvanCloud and the Customer will agree mutually to a new condition in order to replace the void/annulled condition, thereby trying to approximate the intentions of the void/annulled condition as much as possible.\n</p> 3.\nOffer and agreement <p> 3.1.\nAll offers made by ArvanCloud are made without purchase obligation, unless explicitly specified in writing.\n</p>\n<p> 3.2.\nOffers made by ArvanCloud are valid for the term indicated on the offer.\nIn case no term has been indicated, the offer will be valid for two (2) weeks after the date of emission of the offer.\n</p>\n<p> 3.3.\nAgreements come into effect through the acceptance by ArvanCloud of the order given in writing by the Customer or at the moment of execution of an order by ArvanCloud.\n</p>\n<p> 3.4.\nAgreements are always closed for a duration of thirty-six (36) months, unless otherwise agreed.\nPremature termination is out of the question.\n</p>\n<p> 3.5.\nAt the end of their established term, agreements are always prolonged with consecutive terms of twelve (12) months, unless otherwise agreed.\nServices ordered through the automated ordering process are automatically renewed with the same period as the initial ordering period, unless a cancellation has been received in time (article 13.4).\n</p> 4.\nPrices, rates and surcharges <p> 4.1.\nAll prices and rates mentioned by ArvanCloud are in Euro, unless explicitly specified otherwise in writing.\n</p>\n<p> 4.2.\nAll prices and rates mentioned by ArvanCloud are given VAT excluded and without taking into account any other taxes imposed by the government.\nSimilarly, transportation and delivery costs or travel expenses have not been taken into account, unless explicitly specified otherwise in writing.\n</p>\n<p> 4.3.\nAt all times, ArvanCloud has the right to modify its prices and rates.\nUnless explicitly agreed in writing that prices and rates are valid for a given period, the announced price changes for delivery of Products and/or Services will come into effect two (2) months after their announcement.\n</p>\n<p> 4.4.\nIf the Customer doesn\u2019t agree with a price and/or rate change announced by ArvanCloud, the Customer has the right to terminate the agreement with ArvanCloud in writing, within fourteen (14) days following the announced change and by the time the announced change will come into effect.\n</p>\n<p> 4.5.\nIn the event of a derogation of the original agreement between ArvanCloud and the Customer, authorized by the Customer, the ensuing surcharge will be calculated by means of the prices and/or rates in vigour at the time of execution of the additional service and presented to the Customer.\n</p> 5.\nPayment <p> 5.1.\nThe Customer must pay invoices issued by ArvanCloud within the term mentioned on the invoice in question.\nIn the event that no deadline for payment is mentioned on an invoice, a term of thirty (30) days will be applicable.\n</p>\n<p> 5.2.\nAll payments by the Customer to ArvanCloud are deduced from the old unpaid invoices addressed to the Customer, regardless of any other indication given by the Customer.\n</p>\n<p> 5.3.\nAny request for suspension, clearance or deduction submitted by the Customer will be rejected.\n</p>\n<p> 5.4.\nAt all times, ArvanCloud has the right to request (partial) payment in advance for the delivery of Products and/or Services, for instance through an authorisation of direct debit given to ArvanCloud.\nArvanCloud also has the right to suspend delivery until the advance payment has been received.\nFurthermore, ArvanCloud has the right to request security of payment in the form preferred and indicated by ArvanCloud (e.g.\nbanker\u2019s guarantee).\nIn that case, ArvanCloud will not deliver the Products and/or Services until the desired security has been provided.\n</p>\n<p> 5.5.\nAny amount not paid when due shall be subject to a penalty of two per cent (2%) of the amount per month calculated pro rata die.\n</p>\n<p> 5.6.\nIn case of Customer fails to reimburse ArvanCloud for Services/Products it has used for more than 7 days, it waive all its rights regarding the data it has stored on Services/Product and ArvanCloud shall have the right to remove all of Customer\u2019s data without prior notice or warning.\n</p>\n<p> 5.7.\nArvanCloud reserves the right to dissolve the agreement and consider it dissolved by right if the party concerned doesn\u2019t timely pay the amounts due in accordance with this agreement.\n</p>\n<p> 5.8.\nIn the event of late payment, the party concerned accepts liability for all judicial and extra-judicial costs and interests by right incurred by any third party involved by ArvanCloud or the debt collection agency.\n</p>\n<p> 5.9.\nIn the event the Customer performs a charge back on any payment without filing a reclamation or objection with ArvanCloud first, the Customer will be invoiced at \u20ac25,- per charge back to cover administrative fees.\n</p> 6.\nDelivery, risks and retention of title <p> 6.1.\nThe terms of delivery announced by ArvanCloud for Products and/or Services are presented only for information purposes, thus are never to be considered a deadline, unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.\n</p>\n<p> 6.2.\nThe risk of loss or damage to the Products in the frame of the agreement between ArvanCloud and the Customer is transferred to the Customer from the moment the Products in question become the actual possession of the Customer or any proxy acting on its behalf.\n</p>\n<p> 6.3.\nIt is compulsory that the Customer should check all delivered Products for possible defects or flaws immediately following delivery.\n</p> 7.\nReclamations <p> 7.1.\nAny contestation from the Customer regarding a ArvanCloud invoice or an amount recovered by ArvanCloud through direct debit should be notified in writing to ArvanCloud within fourteen (14) days following the invoice date or the date on which the direct debit was performed.\npast this deadline, the invoiced or debited sum shall be considered approved by the Customer.\n</p>\n<p> 7.2.\nShould the Customer consider that a Product or Service delivered by ArvanCloud does not meet the criteria agreed on between both parties, then the Customer should immediately notify ArvanCloud within fourteen (14) days following delivery or following the moment starting from which the Customer could have reasonably noticed the shortcoming indicated by it.\n</p> 8.\nIntellectual property <p> 8.1.\nAll rights on intellectual property pertaining to the Products and/or Services as well as to designs, programs, documentation and any other material developed and/or used for the preparation or implementation of the agreement between ArvanCloud and the Customer \u2013 or the rights deriving thereof \u2013 are solely vested in ArvanCloud or its suppliers.\nThe delivery of Products and/or Services doesn\u2019t entail any transfer of rights of intellectual property.\n</p>\n<p> 8.2.\nThe Customer is always granted a mere non-exclusive and

characterizations of the integrated cloud infrastructure services provided under the legal name of ArvanCloud belonging to Noyan ArvanCloud Company.\nHenceforth, ArvanCloud will be referred to as the company.\nThe company is bound to provide the promised level of quality to the user who is benefiting from one or more of ArvanCloud\u2019s infrastructural services.\n</p>\n<p> This agreement provides a detailed explanation of the accessibility, maintenance, and limitations of ArvanCloud\u2019s infrastructural services.\nFurthermore, services provided in case of disruptions in such services are elaborated.\nIt is worth mentioning that all types of service disruptions of the company will be examined according to the present document, and compensations will be offered.\n</p>\n<p> This agreement applies to those who have paid the service fees and are not in debt to the company.\nThe service in question must also be active.\nSuch services will not be extended to users who have a negative balance or are in debt to the company.\n</p>\n<p> Using any of ArvanCloud\u2019s infrastructural services connotes to complete agreement with the content of this page.\nRejecting the agreement means the terminations of all services.\nTherefore, if the user does not agree to the SLA, we ask that they refrain from using our products and services.\n</p>\n<p> Any change and updates in the content of this page will be informed to the user through various means such as letter, fax, email, or notification in the user panel.\nNonetheless, users are responsible for checking this page periodically to learn the latest updates to the agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nDefinition</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The 30 days:</strong> The period of 30 calendar days beginning with paying and activating one of the cloud infrastructural services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access Time:</strong> The time the user has accessed the services without disruptions (other than the pre-defined limitations) </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Penalties:</strong> If the Service fails to meet the above service level, the Customer will receive a credit equal to the result of the Service Credit calculation for this SLA.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Monthly Expense:</strong> The monthly payment made for every 30 days of active service.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Monthly Uptime Access Ratio:</strong> The ratio of the time of cloud infrastructural service accessed, activated, or available to use compared to the amount of the disruption in 30 days.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disruption:</strong> Any disruptions in any of cloud infrastructural services that are in line with the conditions on this page and are not part of the pre-defined limitations are acknowledged, and the duration will be calculated for the credit service.\nThe disruptions are defined separately for each cloud service.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Monthly Uptime Access Ratio:</strong> The ratio of the time of cloud infrastructural service accessed, activated, or available to use compared to the amount of the disruption in 30 days.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Credit Service:</strong> The calculated credit for the duration of disruption in cloud services.\nThis does not include the pre-defined limitations of each service.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Professional Credit Service Price Rate: </strong> The Professional Consultation, Support, and Customer Service package price.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Enterprise Credit Service Price Rate: </strong> The Enterprise Consultation, Support, and Customer Service package cost.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nLimitations</strong>\n</p>\n<p> The following reasons for disruptions are not applicable to the Credit Services: </p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.1.\nThe disruption is out of the company\u2019s control: </strong> Instances such as natural disasters, war, terrorist attacks, riots, governmental actions, interruptions in worldwide internet network, telecommunication infrastructure, network routing of the customer\u2019s internet, and any other interruptions outside of the company\u2019s control.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2.\nThe source of disruption belongs to the customer: </strong> Having set the wrong configuration in the user panel, or hardware, software, or network issues such as website or bandwidth problems on the customer's side.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.3.\nThe disruptions are caused by the customer\u2019s misuse of the services: </strong> For instance, illegal or misuse of the services, or using malware to benefit from the resources provided for the customer, any activities that include sending malware, impersonation, sending spams, hacking, or any other kind of misuse of the service results in immediate and permanent termination of services to the customer.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.4.\nThe disruptions caused by the application of Terms of Service: </strong> For instance, legal verdicts have requested the termination of the customer\u2019s services from national and international judicial entities.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> 4.\nCredit Services in Breaching the SLA Terms </strong>\n</p>\n<p> The company is responsible for providing monthly uptime access for each cloud service unless limitations and restrictions apply.\n</p>\n<p> When disruption has occurred, the ratio of disruption duration to the active duration in the 30 days will be calculated according to the monthly expense of each service, and the information will be accessible in the user panel of the customer.\n</p>\n<p> The percentage of monthly uptime access is calculated through the following: </p>\n<p> Monthly Uptime % = (Maximum Available Minutes-Downtime) / Maximum Available Minutes x 100 </p>\n<p> If, for example, a service is down for 20 minutes in one month, the percentage will be calculated like the following: </p>\n<p> ArvanCloud\u2019s Credit Services for each service is explained in the following:

this agreement, the credit service will be activated in order to compensate for the monthly uptime access.\nThe company will not be responsible for compensating the possible losses of the user.\nThe maximum credit service is 100% of the monthly expense of the down service.\nThus, the compensated expense will not be more than the monthly expense, and the compensations will not be provided for other losses of the customer.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> 6.\nRequesting and Using Credit Service </strong>\n</p>\n<p> When requesting credit service, the customer needs to send an official letter or a ticket to the support team of the company titled \u201cCredit Service Request.\u201d The service downtime logs and reports must be included in the letter.\nCredit Service can be requested up to 20 days following the disruption in the service.\nThe company will examine your request to see its submitted time and whether the interruptions were part of the applied restrictions and limitations, after which the credit service will be calculated and provided for the user.\nThis credit service can only be used for the cloud services provided and under no conditions will the financial settlement be offered.\n</p>\n<p> Last Update: January 2022 </p> ", "created_at": "2022-07-29 07:00:16.562902", "updated_at": "2022-07-29 05:07:27.550284"}, {"id": 12268, "name": "Cookie Statement", "url":
