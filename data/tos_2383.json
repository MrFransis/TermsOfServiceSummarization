counter-notification provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\") and other applicable intellectual property laws.</p>\n<p>The DMCA provides a process for an owner of copyrighted material to notify an online service provider of alleged copyright infringement.\nUpon receipt of a valid DMCA removal notification (described below), we will remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content and take reasonable steps to contact the party that originally posted that content to allow it to file a counter-notification that indicates that it had the right to post the content.\nUpon receipt of a valid counter-notification (also described below), we may restore the content in question, unless we receive timely notice from the party that requested removal that a legal action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing activity.</p>\n<p>By submitting either a removal notification or a counter-notification as described herein, the submitting party acknowledges and agrees that we may provide copies of such notices and any information contained therein to the other participants in the dispute or to any other third parties deemed necessary by us.\nPlease note that federal law provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents: (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>Removal

infringed, or a statement that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the material that has allegedly been infringed.</p>\n<p>2.\nYour name, address, telephone number and, if available, an email address so that we may contact you.</p>\n<p>3.\nA statement identifying the material that you believe to be infringing and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate that material.\n(If you believe multiple copyrighted works have been infringed, you can submit a single notification with a representative list of the allegedly infringed works.)</p>\n<p>4.\nA statement that you have a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</p>\n<p>5.\nA statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the removal notification is accurate.</p>\n<p>6.\nYour signature.\n(The signature may be electronic.)</p>\n<p>Promptly after receipt of a valid removal notification, we will remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content.\nWe will also notify the party that posted it of your claim that the material is infringing and will give that party an opportunity to send us a written counter-notification as provided below.</p>\n<p>Counter-Notification</p>\n<p>In response to our receipt of a valid removal notice and removal of material, if you believe that the allegedly infringing material is not infringing and want us to restore it on the Website or App, please send a counter-notification to our designated copyright agent as provided below.</p>\n<p>To be considered valid, your counter-notification must be written and include the following:</p>\n<p>1.\nYour name, address, telephone number and, if available, an email address so that we may contact you.</p>\n<p>2.\nA statement identifying the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</p>\n<p>3.\nA statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material.</p>\n<p>4.\nA statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or for Los Angeles County, California, if your address is outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the person who sent the removal notice or an agent of such person.</p>\n<p>5.\nYour signature.\n(The signature may be electronic.)</p>\n<p>Promptly after receipt of a valid counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original removal notification.\nAfter we send out the counter-notification, the party that submitted the original removal notification must then notify us within 10 business days that it has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in the allegedly infringing activity.\nIf we receive such notification, we will not restore the material.\nIf we do not receive such notification, we may reinstate the material within 10 to 14 days of receipt of the valid counter-notification.</p>\n<p>Where to Send Notices</p>\n<p>All notices should be sent to our designated copyright agent using the following

StoryFire agree that we will resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings.\n&nbsp;All controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and StoryFire relating to the Services or this Agreement (each a \"Claim\") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of Jams, Inc.\n(\"JAMS\").\n&nbsp;If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an available alternative dispute resolution provider (\u201cADR Provider\u201d) and the rules of such provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration.\nThe arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator.\n&nbsp;The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, JAMS, you and StoryFire must abide by the following rules: &nbsp;(a) the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions.\nand (b) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.\n&nbsp;If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by JAMS rules, and the hearing (if any) will take place within one hundred miles of your residence.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, StoryFire will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive.\n&nbsp;In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies.\n&nbsp;You and StoryFire also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court.\n&nbsp;In addition, you and StoryFire retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with this Agreement, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>NEITHER YOU NOR STORYFIRE MAY ACT AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, NOR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM.\n&nbsp;CLAIMS MAY NOT BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS.\n&nbsp;THE ARBITRATOR CAN DECIDE ONLY YOUR AND/OR STORYFIRE'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS.\n&nbsp;THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PERSONS OR PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If any provision of this Section 14 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section 14 shall continue in full force and effect.\n&nbsp;No waiver of any provision of this Section 14 will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement.\n&nbsp;Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Agreement.\n&nbsp;This Section 14 will survive the termination of your relationship with StoryFire.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION OR TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM AND THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES OR THE RULES OF AN ADR PROVIDER.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>15.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;App Store.\n&nbsp;When you download our Apps, you may do so through a third party\u2019s App Store.\nYou acknowledge that

Store Owner, are solely responsible for the Services, including the App, the content, maintenance, support services, and warranty, and addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability,

&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify the App Store Owner, and the App Store Owner will refund the purchase price for the App Store Sourced Application to you (if any) and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the App Store Owner will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store Sourced Application.\nAs between StoryFire and the App Store Owner, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of StoryFire.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(d) &nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and we acknowledge that, as between StoryFire and the App Store Owner, the App Store Owner is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims.\n(ii) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement.\nand (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(e) &nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and we acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, as between StoryFire and the App Store Owner, StoryFire, not the App Store Owner, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(f) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and we acknowledge and agree that the App Store Owner, and the App Store Owner\u2019s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application, and that, upon your acceptance of this Agreement, the App Store Owner will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the terms of this Agreement as related to your license of the App Store Sourced Application against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(g) &nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without limiting any other terms in this Agreement, you must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced Application.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>16.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Waiver.\n&nbsp;No delay or omission by either party hereto to exercise any right or power occurring upon any noncompliance or default by the other party with respect to any of the terms of this Agreement shall impair any such right or power or be construed to be a waiver thereof.\n&nbsp;The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived or amended only in writing and only by the party that is entitled to the benefits of the term(s) or condition(s) being waived or amended.\n&nbsp;Unless stated otherwise, all remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be cumulative and in addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies available to either party at law, in equity, or otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>17.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Unenforceability.\n&nbsp;If any provision of this Agreement or any word, phrase, clause, sentence, or other portion thereof should be held to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, then such provision or portion thereof shall be modified or deleted in such manner as to render this Agreement as modified legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted under applicable laws.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>18.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Authority.\n&nbsp;The party entering into this Agreement
