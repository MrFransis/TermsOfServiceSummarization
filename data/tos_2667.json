are an authorized representative of the School and you agree to these Terms on the School\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>The U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) requires that online service providers obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13.\nIf you are a School providing the Service to children under 13 (whether in the U.S.\nor elsewhere), you represent and warrant that you have received consent from Parents, or have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents, for us to collect information from students before allowing children under 13 to access Desmos Services.\nWe recommend that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of service providers such as Desmos.</p>\n3.\nPersonal Information and Student Data\n<p>This Section 3 applies to a School\u2019s use of the Desmos Service through student.desmos.com.\nIf you are a School user, Student, or parent, you may also refer to the Student Data Privacy Statement.</p>\n<p>When Desmos is used by a School for an educational purpose, Desmos may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the School or by the Student.\n\u201cStudent Data\u201d is personal information that is directly related to an identifiable Student and may include \u201ceducational records\u201d as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), 20 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1232(g).</p>\n<p>\n<em>Confidentiality</em>.\nDesmos agrees to treat Student Data as confidential and not to share it with third parties other than as described in these Terms, and in our Privacy Policy and Student Data Privacy Statement.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Student Data Access</em>.\nYou authorize Desmos to access or collect Student Data for the purpose of providing the Service.\nIn the U.S., Desmos shall collect and process Student Data as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1).\nAs between the parties, the School or the Student owns and controls the Student Data.\nDesmos does not own or control, or license such Student Data, except as to provide the Service and as described in these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Personal Information and Student Data Consents and Authority</em>.\nIf you are School User, you represent and warrant that you

applicable State laws relating to student data privacy.\nDesmos relies on each School to obtain and provide appropriate consent and disclosures, if necessary, for Desmos to collect any Student Data, including the collection of Student Data directly from students under 13, as permitted under COPPA.\nWe recommend that you provide a copy of the Desmos Student Data Privacy Statement to Parents.\nYou

Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing our rights under these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the School\u2019s or the User\u2019s consent.\n<strong>Desmos shall not use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Use of Anonymized Student Data</em>.\nYou agree that we may collect and use data derived from Student Data for our own

specific individual.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Use of Personal Information for Marketing</em>.\nYou agree that Desmos may provide customized content, advertising, and commercial messaging to school or district administrative users and teachers from time to time, provided that such advertisements shall not be based on Student Data.\nFor emphasis, and without limitation, Desmos shall never use Student Data to

delete content a Student shared to public areas of the Service.\nWe shall respond to the deletion request as soon as possible, but in most instances within 45 days, other than for data stored on backup tapes which shall be deleted in the ordinary course of business.\nFor inactive accounts, we delete or de-identify Student Data in our possession after a period of dormancy or at the request of a Parent.\nA Parent seeking to modify, correct, or delete personal information in a Student Account that is connected to an active School account will be instructed to contact the School to discuss data deletion or modification.\nWe are not required to delete data that has been derived from Student Data so long as it has been anonymized such that it does not reasonably identify an individual.\nSimilarly, we are not required to delete information which a Student or parent has saved or transferred to a personal account.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Data Breach Notification</em>.\nWe have implemented administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to secure Personal Information, including Student Data, from unauthorized access, disclosure and use.\nIn the event we have a reasonable, good faith belief that an unauthorized party has gained access to or been disclosed Student Data (a \u201c<strong>Security Event</strong>\u201d), that we have collected or received through the Service, we will promptly notify the School.\nIf, due to a Security Event which is caused by the acts or omissions of Desmos or its agents, a notification to an individual, organization or government agency is required under applicable privacy laws, the School shall be responsible for the timing, content, and method of any such legally-required notice and compliance with such laws and Desmos shall indemnify the School for costs related to legally-required notifications.\nWith respect to any Security Event which is not caused by the acts or omissions of Desmos or its agents, Desmos shall reasonably cooperate with School\u2019s investigation of the Security Event, as School requests, at School\u2019s reasonable expense.\nDesmos shall be responsible for the timing, content, cost

through Desmos Services are governed by federal and state law and by our contract with Schools, if one exists.\nThis Desmos Student Data Privacy Statement explains how we use and share Student Data we may collect through Desmos Services.\nIf you have questions about specific practices relating to Student Data provided to Desmos by a School, please direct your questions to your School.</p>\nThe Desmos Pledge\n<p>The privacy of personally identifiable student information is very important to us.\nWe are honored that our School customers choose Desmos as a trusted educational service provider and we strive to live by high data privacy and security standards.\nWhen we have access to the personal information of students, we commit to the following data privacy principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Desmos collects, stores, processes, and shares Student Data only for the purposes of providing our Service, or as authorized by a school or a parent.</li>\n<li>Desmos does

support@desmos.com</p>\nWhat Student Data do we collect?\n<p>Desmos provides the Service to Schools to improve classroom instruction and student learning outcomes.\nThrough the provision of this Service to a School, we may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the School or by the student.\nThe type of information we collect will depend on how the School uses the Service, but could include the student\u2019s first and last name, email address, class assignment data, and other classroom content.\nOnly students who have been provided an access code and authorized to use the Service by a School can be associated with a School account.\nStudents may continue to access class content using the School code.\nTo save content on the Service, the Student will need to register for a Desmos account by providing some personal information or by logging in through a Google account.</p>\n<p>Please note that only accounts set up with a School code and accounts set up on student.desmos.com are considered to be Student accounts.\nIf you are a teacher, administrator, or other individual using the Service on behalf of a School, please do not instruct students to sign up for Desmos without providing a class code and/or instructing students to sign up through student.desmos.com or similar address created for School users.\nSchools must sign up for a School account to use the Service in the classroom setting so that student\u2019s information is known to be Student Data.</p>\n<p>We consider Student Data to be highly confidential and use this data solely to provide our Services to the School, and in limited ways, for our internal purposes in accordance with our Terms of Service or specific agreements with Schools.\nOur collection, use, and disclosure of Student Data is governed by our Terms of Service and/or any other agreement with the School, in the U.S.\nby the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and applicable privacy laws relating to the collection and use of personal information of students.\nIf you have any questions about our collection and use of Student Data, please contact us at support@desmos.com.\nIf you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting the personal information of a student, please contact your School directly.</p>\nHow do we use Student Data?\n<p>We use Student Data to provide the Desmos Services to the School and for other limited purposes permitted by our agreements with the Schools, such as to evaluate, improve, and develop our products, applications, and services.\nAll Student Data that we collect or have access to is owned and controlled by the Schools.\nWe do not use Student Data for marketing purposes or to engage in targeted advertising.</p>\nDo we share Student Data with third parties?\n<p>Desmos only shares Student Data in a few limited circumstances, as described below.</p>\n<p>We may share Student Data in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As needed to perform the Desmos Services and/or at the direction of a School and as authorized by our contract with the School.\nFor example, information including Student Data, will be shared between and among authorized School users, such as teachers and administrators.Schools may also be able to facilitate data sharing with other authorized third parties.\nThis sharing will depend on the settings and functionality selected by the School.</li>\n<li>With our trusted vendors, third party service providers and other individuals who perform services on our behalf, but only if such providers have a need to access such information for the purpose of carrying out their work for us and do so under strict confidentiality and data security terms.</li>\n<li>We may share aggregate or anonymized data (including personal data that has been stripped of personally identifying characteristics) with third parties, but will do so only in such a way that no individual may reasonably be identified.</li>\n<li>We may be required to share information with law enforcement or other third parties when compelled to do so by court order or other legal process, to comply with statutes or regulations, to enforce our Terms of Use, or if we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or personal safety of our visitors.</li>\n<li>In the event of a change of control: If we sell, divest or transfer the business or a portion of our business, we will not transfer Student personal information without first giving you the ability to opt-out of the transfer by deleting your account, unless the new owner intends to maintain and provide the Service as a going concern, and provided that the new owner has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own.\nWe may also transfer personal information \u2013 under the same conditions \u2013 in the course of mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of our business</li>\n</ul>\nHow do we use anonymized data?\n<p>We may use data which has been de-identified and/or aggregated for product development, research analytics, and other purposes, including for the purpose of analyzing, improving, or marketing the Applications and Desmos Services.\nIf Desmos publicly discloses or shares with third parties (e.g., in marketing materials, published research, analytics, or in application development) information that is derived from Student Data, such data will be aggregated and/or anonymized to reasonably avoid identification of a specific School or individual.</p>\nQuestions about access or deletion of data\n<p>You may access, update, or correct Student Data by logging into your account.\nParents may request to access, correct, and update a student\u2019s personal information, but these requests may require the School\u2019s authorization to update or delete information contained in active School accounts.\nIf you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting personal information of a student, please contact your School directly.</p>\nChildren's Data\n<p>Our Service is not directed to children under 13 unless and until a School has provided appropriate consent and authorization for a student under 13 to use the Services and for Desmos to collect information from such student.\nDesmos relies on each School to obtain and provide appropriate consent and disclosures, if necessary, to collect any student information directly from students, as permitted by the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>\nPrivacy Policy Changes with respect to Student Data\n<p>Because we continue to develop the Desmos Service and take advantage of technologies to improve the Services we provide, our policies will change over time.\nWe will note the effective date of the policy at the bottom of this page, and you should review this page periodically for any changes.\nWe will use our best efforts to provide each School at least 30 days-notice of a Privacy Policy change that may involve collecting, using, storing, or sharing Student Data in a materially different manner than was disclosed in our previous Privacy Policy, so that the School has sufficient time to evaluate the change in practice.\nIf you do not choose to accept the changes, you may opt-out by deleting your account before the changes take effect.</p>\n<p>This document was last modified on May 9, 2017.</p> ",
