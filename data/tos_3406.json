participate in a Promotion, we may collect your personal information, such as your name, address, age, birthdate, credit card number, telephone number, name of your cable provider, email address or other information.\nParticipation in certain Promotions may be subject to specific official rules governing such Promotions, which may be announced in connection therewith.\nRegardless of whether or not specific rules are announced separately, all Promotions will be controlled by the Terms.\nAs a condition to receiving any award or prize in connection with a Promotion, you may be required to provide additional personal information (such as, your social security number) and to sign a release, affidavit or waiver.\nDecisions of Crown Media shall be final in all matters relating to the Promotions.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Winner(s) will be selected in a random drawing taking place on or about the date publicized by us from among all eligible entries received during the entry period.\n</b>Prize award is subject to verification of eligibility and compliance with the Terms.\nPotential winner will be confirmed via email and/or phone and may be required to sign and return, within a specified period of notification, Affidavit of Eligibility, IRS Form W-9, Liability Waiver, and where allowable, a Publicity Release (collectively, \u201cthe Releases\u201d).\nFailure to return any of the Releases required by us could result in forfeiture of the prize.\nIf (1) prize notification is returned as undeliverable, (2) potential winner cannot be contacted, (3) potential winner is found to be ineligible or not in compliance with these rules, and/or (4) potential winner cannot or unwilling to accept or receive the prize (or any part thereof) for any reason, such potential winner may be disqualified and the prize may be awarded to an alternate winner.\nWinner will be solely responsible for all expenses associated with using the prize, unless otherwise specified in specific official rules.\nWinner must accept the prize as stated and \u201cas-is\u201d or prize may be forfeited and may be awarded to an alternate prize winner.\nAny difference between the stated ARV of a prize (if ARV is required to be specified) and the actual value of a prize will not be awarded to the prize winner.\nPrizes are non-transferable in whole or in part except at the discretion of us.\nNo substitution or cash redemption will be awarded except at the discretion of us.\nWe reserve the right to substitute a prize (or component thereof) in the event a prize is unavailable for any reason whatsoever.\nWinner shall bear all risk of loss or damage to prize upon being awarded to winner and we do not have any obligation or responsibility to replace prize if lost, damaged or stolen.\nWe have not made nor in any manner are responsible or liable for any warranty, representation, or guarantee, express or implied, in fact or in law, relative to any prize thereof, including, but not limited to, its quality, condition, appearance, safety, performance.\nWe are not responsible for any fees, costs, or additional charges resulting from you entering and participating in a Promotion and/or being awarded and/or receiving and/or using a prize.\nNon-winning entrants will not be notified.\nOdds of winning a prize depend on the number of eligible entries received.<br>1.\nBy participating, entrants (and his/her parents/legal guardian if winner is a minor) agree to hold Crown Media, its agencies, its prize providers, affiliates, cable providers, social network (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) and their respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and advertising and promotion agencies, prize suppliers and all of their respective directors, officers, employees, assigns and agents (collectively, \u201cReleased Parties\u201d) harmless from and against any claim or cause of action, including, but not limited to, personal injury, death, or damage to or loss of property, arising out of participation in a Promotion or receipt or use<b>\n</b>or misuse of any prize.\nAcceptance of prize constitutes granting permission to Crown Media and its designees to use winner\u2019s name, likeness (and biographical information) for advertising, marketing and other purposes in any and all media, now or hereafter devised, in any manner, worldwide in perpetuity, without further compensation, notification or right of approval, unless prohibited by law.\nThe Released Parties are not responsible for (1) any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by entrant, printing errors or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Promotions, (2) technical failures of any kind, including, but not limited to, malfunctions, interruptions, or disconnections in phone lines or network hardware or software, (3) unauthorized human intervention in any part of the entry process or the Promotions, (4) technical or human error which may occur in the administration of the Promotions or the processing of entries, (5) late, lost, undeliverable, damaged or stolen mail or (6) any injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant\u2019s participation in the Promotions or receipt or use<b>\n</b>or misuse of any prize.\nReleased Parties are not responsible for misdirected or undeliverable entries or for any technical problems, malfunctions of computer systems, servers, providers, hardware/software, lost or unavailable network connections or failed, incomplete, garbled or delayed computer transmission or any combination thereof.\nReleased Parties are not responsible for any typographical, clerical, logistical or other error in entries, selection announcement or for any liability for damage to any computer system resulting from participation in, accessing or downloading information in connection with a Promotion.\nIf for any reason an entrant's Promotion entry is confirmed to have been erroneously deleted, lost, or otherwise destroyed or corrupted, entrant\u2019s sole remedy is another entry in such Promotion, provided that, if it is not possible to award another entry due to discontinuance of such Promotion, or any part of it, for any reason, Released Parties, in their sole discretion, may elect to hold a random drawing from among all eligible entries received up to the date of discontinuance for any or all of the prizes offered herein.\nNo more than the stated number of prizes will be awarded.\nIn the event that production, technical, seeding, programming or any other reasons cause more than the stated number of prizes to be available and/or claimed, Released Parties reserve the right to award only the stated number of prizes by a random drawing among all legitimate, un-awarded, eligible prize claims.\nWe reserve the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a Promotion, or any part of it, if any fraud, technical failures or any other factor beyond our reasonable control impairs the integrity or proper functioning of the Promotion or for any other reason, as determined by us in our sole discretion.\nWe, in our sole discretion, reserve the right to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the entry process or the operation of the Promotion or to be acting in violation of the Terms or any other promotion or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner.\nIf disqualified, no prize may be awarded or prizes may be awarded in a random drawing using all non-suspect, eligible entries received as of the date of termination.\nWe may demand the winner of a Promotion to immediately return any prize (or the value of the prize) which has been or may be awarded if any statement made by such winner to us is false or if such winner is disqualified for any reason.\nAny attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, we reserve the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nOur failure to enforce any term of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.\nIn the event a dispute arises as to the identity of a potentially winning online entrant, entries made by internet will be declared name on the online entry form.\nNo Promotion conducted on a social network (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) is in any way sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with such relevant social network.\nAll applicable federal and state laws apply.\nAny federal, state and local taxes resulting from acceptance and use of prize are the responsibility of the winner.\nUnless otherwise set forth in specific rules for a particular Promotion, Promotions are only open to persons who are as of the date of entry 21 years of age and legal residents of and physically located within the 48 contiguous United States.\nAny prize awarded as part of a Promotion will be shipped only within the United States.</p>\n<p>\n<b>LINKED THIRD PARTY WEBSITES AND ADVERTISERS</b>\n<br>The Websites may

information about yourself, we only share that information with our partners, like the businesses which help process your orders, service providers (like delivery companies), and contractors.\nWe give them this information to help fulfill your orders, offer you products and services, and other consumer service-based needs.\nLikewise, these companies provide information to us so we can provide you with product or service suggestions we think you might be interested in.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hallmark allows certain companies to place tracking technologies like cookies and pixels on our sites, which allow these companies to receive information about your activity on our websites.\nThose companies may use that data to show you more relevant advertisements and promotions.\nLearn

using your mobile device ID for targeted advertising.\nYou can also use preferences or settings on your device(s) to manage your privacy controls.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Any non-Hallmark

it.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Security </b>\n<b>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>To protect your information, we use the same

words, the parties to whom we provide your information are people that help us help you.\nAnd we require them to join us in keeping your information safe.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>While we are careful with how your information is treated and are selective when choosing other companies and websites with which we interact, any site Hallmark links to is out of our control.\nSo when

information (name, phone number, etc.) is not shared with them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Under the CCPA, sharing data for online advertising like this may be considered a

marketing efforts, you can take action by opting out of cookies and device ID tracking.\nPlease read the \u201cHow We Use Your Information\u201d section of the policy for more information on how you

us:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Shipping addresses</li>\n<li>Mailing address</li>\n<li>Phone number</li>\n<li>Date of birth</li>\n<li>Account information, including

including device model, operating system version, device date and time, unique device identifiers, mobile network information</li>\n<li>Geolocation of your device</li>\n<li>How you use our sites and mobile applications, including search terms and pages you visit</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Information from third parties:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Information we receive from business partners, including online advertising networks</li>\n<li>Social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest and Instagram.</li>\n</ul> How We Use Your Information\n<p>At Hallmark, we are committed to the security and privacy of your information.\nWhen you provide us with information about yourself, we only share that information with our partners, like the businesses which help process your orders, service providers (like delivery companies), and contractors.\nWe give them this information to help fulfill your orders, offer you products and services, and other consumer service-based needs.\nLikewise, these companies provide information to us so we can provide you with product or service suggestions we think you might be interested in.</p>\n<p>Hallmark allows certain companies to place tracking technologies like cookies and pixels on our sites, which allow these companies to receive information about your activity on our websites.\nThose companies may use that data to show you more relevant advertisements and promotions.\nLearn more about your ability to control privacy settings at the companies we work with, which include but are not limited to, Adobe, Facebook/Instagram, Verizon, LiveRamp, Pinterest and Google/YouTube.</p>\n<p>You always have control over whether these technologies work on your devices.\nYou can disable them entirely by opting-out of third-party cookies or using your mobile device ID for targeted advertising.\nYou can also use preferences or settings on your device(s) to manage your privacy controls.</p>\n<p>Any non-Hallmark company we work with is contractually not allowed to use this information in any other way.\nWe value the trust you place in us, and this is one way we strive to preserve it.</p> Security\n<p>To protect your information, we use the same technology your bank uses to protect your information.\nFor added security, we also use a digital secure server ID to protect you when you use our sites.\nIn other words, the parties to whom we provide your information are people that help us help you.\nAnd we require them to join us in keeping your information safe.</p>\n<p>While we are careful with how your information is treated and are selective when choosing other companies and websites with which we interact, any site Hallmark links to is out of our control.\nSo when interacting with sites outside of Hallmark, please make sure to read their Privacy Policy before sharing your information with them.</p> California Consumer Privacy Act\n<p>Effective January 1, 2020, if you are a California resident, you have expanded rights regarding the collection and disclosure of information about yourself as part of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA).</p>\n<p>Only you or your authorized representative may make these requests.\nYou may make requests for data disclosure or portability no more than twice in a 12-month period.\nIn your request, you must provide enough information to allow us to verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information, or their authorized representative.\nYou must also describe your request with enough detail so that we can understand, evaluate and respond to it.\nWe can\u2019t respond to your request if we can\u2019t verify your identity.\nMaking such a request does not require you to create an account with us, and we will only use the information you provide in a request to verify your identity.\nAuthorized representatives must provide a signed, written permission to make such requests or power of attorney.\nYou may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about any of these rights, please call us at 1-877-203-2262.</p>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.</p>\n<strong>Information We Collect</strong>\n<p>Below are the categories and examples of information we collect, along with how we use that information.\nUnless otherwise noted, we collect this information from our users, customers and service providers.\nUnless otherwise noted, we use this information to enable use of our sites, services and products.\nto communicate with you.\nto understand how users interact with our site.\nand to improve our products and services.\nUnless otherwise noted, we may share this information with our service providers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiers such as name, mailing address, IP address, email address or account name.\nWe may generate these identifiers internally, such as a Crown Rewards membership number.</li>\n<li>Personal information categories such as name, signature, address or phone number.\n(Information in this category may overlap with other categories.)</li>\n<li>Protected classification characteristics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, religion, marital status, and veteran/military status.</li>\n<li>Internet/network activity, such as browsing history, search history, banners you click, and pages you visit on our site.</li>\n<li>Commercial information such as what you purchase or consider purchasing from us and other requests you make.\nThis information allows us to complete those transactions and deliver your orders in a timely manner.</li>\n<li>Geolocation data, such as the location of your computer or mobile device.\nThis helps us show you the nearest stores to your location.</li>\n<li>Sensory data such as audio, electronic, visual or similar information.</li>\n<li>Inferences drawn from other personal information may be generated internally.\nThese inferences may include preferences, characteristics, predispositions and behaviors, and are used to help us provide you more relevant products and services and provide a better experience on our website and apps.\nWe do not share this information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use it in materially different purposes without providing you notice.\nYour personal information may be shared with third parties for business purpose (\u201cservice providers\u201d).\nService providers are required to keep the personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose other than what is specified in what is outlined in our contract with them.</p>\n<strong>Right to Know</strong>\n<p>In accordance with the CCPA, you have the right to know what information we have collected about you.\nYou can request us to disclose this personal information no more than twice in a 12-month period.\nThis information will be provided in an accessible format that allows you to transmit your data from one entity to another.\nIf you would like a list of the information we maintain, we will email it to you within 45 days of your request.\nIf we require more time (up to 90 days) we\u2019ll let you know this, and the reason why, in writing.\nVisit Customer Care or call 1-877-203-2262 to proceed with this request.</p>\n<strong>Right to Delete</strong>\n<p>In accordance with the CCPA, you have the right to request that we delete the information we have about you.\nHallmark offers several services that require certain information in order to work.\nDeleting your information can affect your ability to: \u2022 Earn exclusive offers and coupons \u2022 Maintain membership to Crown Rewards and Keepsake Ornament Club \u2022 Access services like Hallmark Movies Now and Hallmark eCards \u2022 Get the inside scoop on the exciting new surprises Hallmark is working on We will attempt to complete your

information we need to validate your request.</p>\n<strong>Do Not Sell</strong>\n<p>In accordance with the CCPA, if you are 16 years or older, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.\nConsumers who we know are under 16 are already opted-out of this sale of information, unless they have specifically exercised their right to opt-in.\nA parent or guardian must provide an opt-in for consumers less than 13.</p>\n<p>Hallmark does not now, nor have we in the past, sell consumer information to third parties for financial gain.\nWhat we sometimes do is to track your device by sending non-identifying information to partners, who then use it to provide you relevant marketing messages.\nWhen we do this, your personal information (name, phone number, etc.) is not shared with them.</p>\n<p>Under the CCPA, sharing data for online advertising like this may be considered a \u201csale\u201d of information, and we are required to allow you to opt out of selling your information.\nTo help you manage the tracking of your information, including browsing history and targeted marketing efforts, you can take action by opting out of cookies and device ID tracking.\nPlease read the \u201cHow We Use Your Information\u201d section of the policy for more information on how you can manage your privacy via third parties.\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance offers tools for California consumers to send requests under the CCPA to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of the participating companies.\nYou can also manage privacy options directly in your device preferences or settings.</p>\n<strong>Other California Privacy Rights</strong>\n<p>California\u2019s \u201cShine the Light\u201d law (Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B.\n27) allows customers to opt out of having your personal information shared for direct marketing purposes.\nTo make this request, you may write us at Hallmark Cards Consumer Care.\nP.O.\nBox
