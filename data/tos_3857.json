does NationStates collect from people who visit our website?\n<p>We may collect:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Your IP address.</b> This happens automatically when you connect to the site.\nAn\nIP address does not uniquely identify you, but usually indicates your general geographic area,\nand could be used in conjunction with other information to identify you more specifically.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Your browser's UserAgent.</b> This is a short summary of the make and model of your\nbrowser and device operating system, which is automatically transmitted to sites unless you disable\nit in your browser's settings.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Cookies.</b> Cookies are used to track returning visitors to the site, so that when you\ncome back, we can connect that session to your previous activity.\nWithout cookies, you can't stay\nlogged in, as we can't tell whether you've already authenticated.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Your e-mail address.</b> NationStates players may optionally supply an e-mail address.\nThis is treated as personally identifying information and therefore private data.\nYou are not required to supply an e-mail address to browse the site or create an account (a nation),\nbut you can do so for password recovery and if you wish to join the in-game World Assembly organization.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nWhen does NationStates collect information?\n<p>Your IP address is recorded whenever you visit any page.\n</p>\n<p>Your UserAgent is recorded when you log in.\n</p>\n<p>Your e-mail address is collected if you choose to supply one during registration (i.e.\nnation creation) or if you enter one later via your Settings.\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are used when a registered user logs into the site.\n</p>Why does NationStates collect this information and how is it used? <p>We use this information:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>To provide basic site functionality</b>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are essential to maintaining a login session.\nThey must be enabled so the site can\nremember that you are logged in.\nOur cookies don't contain any private information\nand only store the name and/or session key of nations you have logged in.\nThey also support\n\"autologin\" / \"Remember me\" functionality, which is an optional setting that allows you to\nskip entering a password each time you visit the site.\n</p>\n<p>If you provide an e-mail address, this is used to verify that address, to support password\nrecovery (\"Forgot my password\"), and (optionally) to send you a reminder if your account\nis scheduled to be deleted for inactivity.\n</p>\n<p>Beyond this, site moderators may use the information to unravel disputes over account\nownership, or to help verify the legitimacy of a request to reactivate an old account.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>To protect the community</b>\n</p>\n<p>Site moderators frequently block or ban people for violating site rules, such as attempting\nto spam, harass players, or post obscene content.\nFor such bans to work, we must be able to identify\nthose people as they attempt to return to the site.\nWe do this by comparing information such as IP\naddresses to that which we have recorded as belonging to banned users.\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, moderators may use this information to identify the source of problems when a person\nuses multiple accounts to conceal their activity.\n</p>\n<p>In these cases, we retain relevant information as long as we believe the problem user represents\na danger to the community, as indicated by the severity of the behavior and the frequency with which\nthe person attempts to circumvent our bans.\nWe will remove the information within eight years of the\nmost recent contact.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>To uphold a \"one player, one World Assembly nation\" rule</b>\n</p>\n<p>The World Assembly is an optional organization within the site that relies on a principle of\none vote per member.\nIn order to enforce this, we use collected information to perform algorithmic\nmatching in order to detect when one person appears to be cheating by operating multiple World Assembly\nnation accounts.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>To manage Store disputes</b>\n</p>\n<p>We don't retain any personal information associated with store transactions.\nBut if you make\na purchase using PayPal or Stripe, those organizations will record data.\nYou can find the\nprivacy policy of PayPal here and Stripe here.\nA NationStates super-admin can use those sites to look up details of NS transactions,\nwhich may include some personal information such as your name, location, and purchase method.\nIf you ask those organizations to delete your personal information, we can no longer see it.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>To perform basic analytics</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use aggregated data to generate internal and Google Analytics reports on the numbers of people using the site,\ntheir geographic spread, the relative popularity of different browsers, devices, and operating systems,\nand so on.\nMore on Google Analytics.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>To serve advertising</b>\n</p>\n<p>We are ad-supported and allow third-party ad networks such as Google AdSense to place advertisements\non the site.\nWe do not share any of your information with these networks.\nHowever, they are\ncapable of independently recording your IP Address and using cookies to track how often you\nview their ads.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>To allow account recovery</b>\n</p>\n<p>NationStates was founded in 2002 and has a rich community history.\nTo allow users to return to the site\nand revive their nations even years later, and for this purpose only, we retain e-mail addresses for up\nto eight years.\nAfter this, all information is scrubbed, and the account can only be reactivated by\npassword.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>To provide backups</b>\n</p>\n<p>Our systems are regularly backed up against data loss, and these backups may include information\nsuch as e-mails and IP addresses associated with nations.\nBackups aren't accessed at all under normal\ncircumstances, and cannot be viewed by moderators.\nThey are purged after three years.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\nWho can see my information?\n<p>Site moderators can view IP Addresses, UserAgents, and e-mail addresses associated with an\naccount.\nWhen they view such information, their actions are logged.\n</p>How does NationStates protect visitor information?\n<p>NationStates employs SSL (aka HTTPS) so that all communication between your device and our\nservers are encrypted.\n</p>\n<p>User passwords are encrypted and never stored in plain text.\n</p>\n<p>Moderators and administrators are trained in dealing with personal information, and whenever\na moderator accesses such information, this access is logged in a way that is visible to all other\nmoderators and administrators.\n</p>Does NationStates use cookies?\n<p>Yes.\nCookies are small files that a site or service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your\nbrowser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and\nremember certain information.\n</p>\n<p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn\noff all cookies.\nYou do this through your browser settings.\nEach browser is a little different, so look at your\nbrowser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.\n</p>\n<p>If you disable cookies, it is impossible to remain logged in.\nYou can only browse the site anonymously.\n</p>Right to Erasure\n<p>You may request that we erase from your account all information we have collected from you: your IP\naddresses, e-mail addresses, and UserAgents.\nYou can also request to view all the information we have collected\nwithout erasing it.\nIn either case, please use the Private Info page.\nIf you\nhave questions, you can also file a Getting Help Request.\n</p>\n<p>If you operate multiple accounts, you must make one request per nation.\n</p>\n<p>It may take a few days to erase all your information.\n</p>\n<p>We may refuse requests in special cases where information must be retained for essential operation of the\nsite.\nfor example, if a person who is banned from the site wants their identifying information erased.\n</p>Third Party Disclosure\n<p>Under normal circumstances, NationStates doesn't sell or transfer any of your information to outside parties.\nHowever, we may do so when we believe it is necessary in order to comply with the law,\nrespond to a real-world threat or personal emergency,\nor protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety.\n</p>\n<p>In the event that ownership of NationStates transfers to a third party\nin the future, said party will be bound by these same conditions, and be required to notify users in advance\nshould they wish to alter them.\n</p>In-Site Disclosure\n<p>We don't disclose your personally identifiable information via forum post or\nany other kind of in-site communication to other users.\nFor example, moderators are not\npermitted to inform users of another user's IP address or e-mail address.\n</p>\n<p>A user may sometimes post their own information (IP address or e-mail address) in order\nto seek technical help.\nThis is not recommended, and we instruct users to use a private\nchannel instead (the Getting Help page).\n</p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information\n<p>We may disclose non-personally identifiable information we collect.\nin particular, under\nsome circumstances we may disclose publicly that particular nations are connected\u2014operated\nby the same person\u2014while not personally identifying the owner.\n</p>\n<p>This is done in order to enforce site rules and etiquette,\ne.g.\nto combat \"puppet wanking,\" when a person posts from multiple accounts\nin order to promote the false impression that many people agree with them.\n</p>Submitted Content\n<p>Users can voluntarily post content to NationStates in a variety of ways, such as:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sending a telegram to another nation.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Posting on a regional message board (RMB).\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Posting in the forums.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Writing a factbook or dispatch.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Uploading an image to use as a national flag.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Voting in a poll or World Assembly motion.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customizing their nation via fields such as its name, national slogan, currency, and animal.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Writing a World Assembly proposal.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Submitting an Issue.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All such content can be viewed by moderators and/or administrators.\n</p>\n<p>With particular reference to <b>telegrams</b>, NationStates assumes a <em>high but\nincomplete</em> level of privacy.\nOur policy:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Moderators may only view the content of telegrams of another nation when they have <em>cause</em>.\nA moderator has cause to inspect telegrams when they have reasonable grounds to believe a violation\nof site rules has occurred or is likely to occur in the near future (e.g.\nin response to a user\ncomplaint about harassment), or\nwhen the nation in question is being considered for elevation to the site staff.\nWhen investigating telegrams, moderators are permitted to view both sides of a conversation,\neven when only one party is being investigated.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Our system requires moderators to enter a reason/reference to view a telegram,\nwhich is permanently logged.\nThis enables administrators and other moderators to verify who viewed\nwhich telegram, when, and for what reason, in order to ensure compliance\nwith site policy.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>NationStates does not disclose which telegrams have been viewed by moderators,\nbut does investigate internally any query as to whether site policy was followed.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nGoogle AdSense\n<p>NationStates uses Google AdSense to display ads to most visitors.\nYou can view\nGoogle's main Privacy Policy\nand their more specific\nAdvertising Privacy Policy.\nGoogle lets you change your ad preferences via\nGoogle Ad Settings.\n</p>\n<p>NationStates has implemented the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Google Display Network Impression Reporting\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Demographics and Interests Reporting\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>DoubleClick Platform Integration\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should know that:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on your visits to this website (for example to distinguish between a new and returning visitor, and track which ads you have clicked on before).\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit not only to NationStates but other sites using the DoubleClick network across the Internet.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting Google Ad Settings.\nYou can opt out of third-party vendors' use of cookies for interest based advertising at aboutads.info.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A list of approved ad exchange vendors, which may serve ads on NationStates via Google DoubleClick, is available here.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n<p>We support the GDPR.\nIn particular, as of May 25, 2018, you can request a list\nof the information we have collected about you, and request that this information\nbe erased (see: Right to Erasure).\n</p>California Online Privacy Protection Act\n<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the US to require commercial websites\nand online services to post a privacy policy.\nThe law aims to reach beyond\nCalifornia to require any person or company\nthat operates websites collecting personally identifiable information\nfrom California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website\nstating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom\nit is being shared, and to comply with this policy.\nMore information is available\nhere.\n</p>\n<p>In accordance with CalOPPA, NationStates agrees that:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A link to this Privacy Policy will be maintained on the NationStates home page.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Privacy Policy link includes the word \"Privacy\" and can be easily be found on the page specified above.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When privacy policy changes, this fact will be posted and timestamped at the top of this Privacy Policy page.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Users are usually able to change some of their personal information by logging in to their account.\nSpecifically, users with active accounts can change their current e-mail address.\nUsers with deleted nations can restore their account and log in.\nHowever, users of accounts that are perma-deleted by moderators, banned from the site,\nor otherwise permanently barred from the public site are thereafter not able to log in and change their personal\ninformation.\nUsers are never able to change their IP address, which is not publicly displayed but is\nlogged.\nAll information may be archived in periodic private system backups.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nCOPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)\n<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13,\nthe Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, the US consumer protection agency, enforces\nthe COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services\nmust do to protect children's privacy and safety online.\n</p>\n<p>NationStates does not specifically market to children under 13.\n</p>Fair Information Practices\n<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law\nin the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant\nrole in the development of data protection laws around the globe.\nUnderstanding\nthe Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented\nis critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.\n</p>\n<p>In line with Fair Information Practices, NationStates will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: users will be notified via a message posted on the site within seven business days.\n</p>\n<p>NationStates also agrees to the individual redress principle, which requires that\nindividuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data\ncollectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.\nThis principle requires\nnot only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also\nthat individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate\nand/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\n</p>CAN SPAM Act\n<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial e-mail, establishes\nrequirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have e-mails\nstopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>NationStates does not send any advertising or promotional e-mail messages.\nIf you supply your e-mail address, it may be used:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To help enforce a site rule limiting players to one World Assembly member nation per person\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To help identify when a site visitor is banned from the site for rule violations by moderators.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To send you an e-mail notification when your account is about to be deleted for lack of activity.\n(You may disable this in your Settings.)\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To send you topic update notification e-mails for any forum topics to which you manually subscribe to receive such updates.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To respond to inquiries and/or other requests or questions.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<br>If at any time you would like to
