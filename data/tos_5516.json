4, 2021Privacy Notice <p>\n</p>\n<p>This is the Privacy Notice for Moodle Pty Ltd (or \u201cwe\u201d), the company at the heart of the Moodle\u2122 community.\nThe Moodle LMS\u2122 software is free and open source, and may be hosted by us, but also by anyone who wishes to manage an installation.\nThis Privacy Notice tells you how we will collect and use your personal data to provide our products and services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have the wellbeing of the community and the users of Moodle\u2122 services at the heart of everything we do.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Importantly, this Privacy Notice outlines how we manage your personal data.\nIf the website you are using is not hosted by us, then the hosting IT administrator of your website will have separate Privacy Law obligations to you.\nIn such circumstances you will need to check directly with your hosting IT administrator as to how your personal data is being managed by them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We hope this Privacy Notice outlines how we manage any of your personal data in its control in a clear and straightforward way.&nbsp;</p>\nWho are we? The Data Controller and Data Protection Officer\n<ul>\n<li>The <b>Data Controller</b> for data processed under this Notice is:<br>\n<b>Moodle Pty Ltd.</b> (ABN 55 116 513 363)<br>\nPO Box 303,<br>\nWest Perth WA 6872<br>\nAustraliaSubmit your enquiry here</li>\n<li>Our independent <b>Data Protection Officer</b> is:<br>\n<b>Data Compliance Europe Ltd.<br>\n</b>Lower Bridge Street<br>\nDublin 8 (Ireland)<br>\nemail: dpo@moodle.com</li>\n</ul>\nWhat is covered by this Privacy Notice?\n<p>Your privacy protection is central to us.\nThis is why we have adopted the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d) as our global standard.\nIt is the most advanced and protective Privacy Law globally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Under GDPR personal data is defined as:&nbsp;\u201cany information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018Data Subject\u201d) and a Data Controller determines the purpose and means of processing personal data., whereas a Data Processor is responsible for processing data on behalf of the Data Controller.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice relates to everyone whose personal data is processed by us.</p>\n<p>Because the Moodle\u2122 software is open source, anyone can install it on their own equipment or device.\nSo, please note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>where Moodle Pty Ltd hosts a website on its own behalf it is the Data Controller for all the personal data collected.\nWhere Moodle Pty Ltd hosts someone else\u2019s installation of the Moodle Platform (as with MoodleCloud) it is the Data Processor for the website administrator of that particular installation.<br>\n</li>\n<li>where Moodle Pty Ltd does not host an installation of the software&nbsp;platform, it is neither the Data Controller nor the Data Processor and those duties fall on the people or&nbsp;organisation(s) who have installed and host those installations.</li>\n</ul>\nWhy does the Moodle <b>Mobile application not need to collect and store any personal data?</b>\n<p>Simply, we do not need your personal data to provide you with our Moodle Mobile application.</p>\n<p>If we provide you with separate additional services through external installations hosted or not by us, we will&nbsp;always seek confirmation from you that it\u2019s ok to do that.</p>\n<p>Additional services provided by us are completely separate from the Moodle Mobile application and in case it is needed we will submit for your consent the relevant Privacy Notice and explain how personal data related to you for specific purposes are collected and what is the nature of the data&nbsp;collected depending on your interaction with us.\nWe are committed to transparency in&nbsp;this and we will provide a very detailed breakdown of these processes in the applicable Privacy Notice submitted.</p>\nWhy do we need to collect and store personal data?\n<p>In order for us to provide you with MoodleCloud and other Moodle-hosted websites we need to collect your personal data&nbsp;for correspondence purposes and/or to allow us to provide you our service(s).\nWe&nbsp;ensure that the information we collect and use is appropriate for this purpose.\nWe are a company which values&nbsp;its users\u2019 data protection and privacy rights and we have no interest in collecting any data beyond what we need to make&nbsp;our service(s) work for you.</p>\n<p>If you are going to be contacted by us for marketing purposes, we will not rely solely on this Privacy Notice, but will&nbsp;always seek additional confirmation from you that it\u2019s ok to do that.</p>\n<p>We always process your personal data for specific purposes, with the nature of the data&nbsp;collected depending on your interaction with us.\nWe are committed to transparency in&nbsp;this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our legal bases for the processing of personal data are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Article 6.1(a), GDPR, Consent</li>\n<li>Article 6.1(b), GDPR, Contract</li>\n<li>Article 6.1 (c), GDPR, Legal Obligation</li>\n<li>Article 6.1(f), GDPR, Legitimate Interest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like more details please refer to Annex 1.</p>\n<p>We only rely on \u2018legitimate interests\u2019 as the legal basis for processing by us, or third parties we use, for these purposes;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>recruitment and induction of new candidates</li>\n<li>emergency contacts for people who work with us, such as employees and contractors for health and safety purposes</li>\n<li>business development</li>\n<li>providing login systems to users via their existing social media

and other people who work with us</li>\n<li>any special categories of special personal data which any user volunteers while using the Moodle systems (for example in a forum or submission)</li>\n</ul>\nDo we share my personal data with anyone else?\n<p>We may pass your personal data on to third-party service providers contracted to Moodle Pty Ltd in the course of&nbsp;dealing with you.\nWe do this because there are some services, such as our video conferencing facility, which will&nbsp;not work unless we are able to make these transfers.\nAny third parties that we share your data with are obliged&nbsp;to keep your details securely, and to use them only to deliver the service they provide on our and of course, your behalf.\nWhen they no longer need your data to fulfil this service, they will dispose of the details in line with&nbsp;our procedures.</p>\n<p>We enter into Data Processing Agreements with our third-party service providers to ensure their commitment to these principles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If we need to pass your sensitive personal data onto a third party we will only do so once we have obtained your consent, or if it is necessary to comply with a contract, or we are legally required to do so.\nIf you would like an up-to-date register of all our third-party service providers, please contact us&nbsp;and we will be happy to provide it.</p>\nHow does Moodle Pty Ltd use my personal data?\n<p>We will process (collect, store and use) the information you provide in a manner compatible with the EU\u2019s&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d).\nWe will endeavour to keep your information accurate and up to date, and&nbsp;not keep it for longer than is necessary.\nWe maintain a register of personal data processes which include a&nbsp;record of the data retention policy for each type of data collected and we commit to only process&nbsp;the minimum amount of data needed.\nWe are required to retain certain information in accordance with the&nbsp;Law, such as information needed for income tax and audit purposes.\nHow long certain kinds of personal data should be&nbsp;kept may also be governed by specific business sector requirements and agreed practices.\nPersonal data may be held&nbsp;in addition to these periods depending on individual business needs.</p>\nCan I find out the personal data that the organisation holds about me?\n<p>We at your request, can confirm what information we hold about you and how it is processed.\nIf we hold personal data about you, you can request the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>identity and the contact details of the person or organisation that has determined how and why to process your&nbsp;data;</li>\n<li>contact details of our Data Protection Officer in the EU, where applicable;</li>\n<li>the purpose of the processing as well as the legal basis for processing;</li>\n<li>if the processing is based on our legitimate interests or a third party, information about&nbsp;those interests;</li>\n<li>the categories of personal data collected, stored and processed;</li>\n<li>recipient(s) or categories of recipients that the data is/will be disclosed to;</li>\n<li>If we intend to transfer the personal data to a third country or international organisation, information about&nbsp;how we ensure this is done securely.\nThe European Union has approved sending personal data to some countries because they&nbsp;meet a minimum standard of data protection.\nIn other cases, we will ensure there are specific measures in place&nbsp;to secure your information.\nThese will rely on measures approved by the EU Commission;</li>\n<li>how long the data will be stored;</li>\n<li>details of your rights to correct, erase, restrict or object to such processing;</li>\n<li>information about your right to withdraw consent at any time;</li>\n<li>how to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority;</li>\n<li>whether the provision of

possible&nbsp;consequences of failing to provide such data;</li>\n<li>the source of personal data if it wasn\u2019t collected directly from you;</li>\n<li>any details and information of automated decision making, such as profiling, and any meaningful information&nbsp;about the logic involved, as well as the significance and expected consequences of such processing.</li>\n</ul>\nHow can I access my personal data rights?\n<p>We accept a request made through your personal Moodle account while you are logged in.\nIn certain circumstances we could ask for additional information and the following forms of ID when information on your personal data is requested:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A colour copy of a Passport, driving licence or National ID Card</li>\n</ul>\nAgreement to these terms of service provides explicit consent for data processing\n<p>By consenting to this Privacy Notice you are giving us permission to process your personal data specifically for the purposes

will always tell you why and how the information will be used.\nAgreement with this Privacy Notice and its accompanying terms and conditions (as applicable) and any Data Processing Agreements, (if they apply to you) will be considered to be explicit consent and we will keep a copy of the records of that consent for audit purposes.</p>\n<p>You may withdraw consent at any time
