conditions:</p>\n<p>As a participant in the \u201cAffiliate Program\u201d, you agree that Company shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, the number of Views for which you shall be

CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN EACH PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND STREAMTAPE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p> Entire Agreement.\nSeverability <p>These Terms and any documents referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between you and Streamtape in connection with the Services.\nExcept as otherwise provided in these Terms, these Terms may only be modified in a writing signed by an authorized officer of Streamtape.\nIf any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and, in any event, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p> Assignment.\nWaiver <p>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Streamtape without restriction.</p>\n<p>Streamtape\u2019s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nNo waiver, express or implied, by either party of any breach of or default under these Terms will constitute a continuing waiver of such breach or default or be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.</p> Governing Law and Jurisdiction <p>These Terms are governed exclusively by the laws of the United Kingdom, without reference to its conflicts of law principles, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.\n</p>\n<p>YOU AGREE THAT
