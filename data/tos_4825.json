Information.</em>\n</strong> On the Service, we may ask you to provide us (and/or our vendors) with the following categories of information: (1) personally identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, including your first and last name, phone number, e-mail address, home address, credit card information (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d).\nand (2) demographic information, including your zip code, frequency of visits, purchase amounts, physical characteristics (to assist customers with reach restrictions and/or visual impairments), and items purchased (\u201cDemographic Information\u201d).\nWe can collect this information through various forms and in various places on the Service or when you interact with the Service.\nTo the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>b.\nInformation We Collect or Store As You Access and Use the Service Generally.<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that store or collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Service (\u201cUsage Information\u201d).\nThis Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a \u201cDevice\u201d) whenever you visit or interact with our Service.\nTo the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>\n<p>This Usage Information includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your IP address, UDID, advertising identifier, and device identifier (\u201cDevice Identifier\u201d).\nA Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;</li>\n<li>your Device functionality (browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);</li>\n<li>the URL that referred you to our Service;</li>\n<li>the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there;</li>\n<li>your Device location;</li>\n<li>your Device characteristics.\nand</li>\n<li>Device data and the time of day.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our App may access and read accounts, data and/or content on your Device, add content to your Device, and change settings of your Device, for the following reasons (i) allowing you to access and use the Service (or certain of its features and functions).\n(ii) showing you the closest Little Caesars to you.\n(iii) saving app images and sound files and writing usage logs to the Device.\n(iv) sending Facebook and Twitter messages you initiate.\n(v) sending and receiving data needed for App operations.\n(vi) to provide you notice when you are not connected to a network.\nand (vii) in connection with your Service usage.\nYou consent to these activities by installing the App or otherwise using the Service.\nYour Device settings may enable you to disable, change or limit some of these activities (See Section 6 for more information) and you can disable all of them associated with the App by uninstalling the App.</p>\n<p>We may use various now and later developed methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (\u201cTracking Technologies\u201d).\nTracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device.\nThe App may also receive signals from and otherwise interact with Tracking Technologies that exist in the physical world.\nTracking Technologies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Cookies.</em>\n</strong> A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service.\nA Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device.\nHTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage.\nUnlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Web Beacons.</em>\n</strong> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as \u201c1x1 GIFs\u201d or \u201cclear GIFs\u201d) may be included in our Service\u2019s pages and messages.\nWeb beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.\nWeb beacons or similar technologies can be used to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Embedded Scripts.</em>\n</strong> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about the links you click on and other of your interactions with the Service.\nThe code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Browser Fingerprinting.</em>\n</strong> Collection and analysis of information from your Device, including your operating system, plug-ins, and system fonts, for purposes of identification.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>ETag, or Entity Tag.</em>\n</strong> A feature of the cache in browsers.\nIt is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.\nIf the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.\nUsed in this manner, ETags are a form of Device Identifier.\nETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Location-Identifying Technologies.</em>\n</strong> Additionally, the Services may use GPS (global positioning systems) software, RFID (radio frequency identification), cellular and Wi-Fi data, and other subsequent location-based technologies and methods later developed.\nThese can use geo-fencing and iBeacons to locate you so we may verify your location, provide directions to our nearest Little Caesars, coordinate the preparation of your order based on your distance from a Little Caesars, deliver you relevant content based on your location, as well as monitor via the Service the efficiency of the services we provide to you.\nUpon downloading the App, we provide location-based services to your approximate and/or exact location information.\nGeo-fencing utilizes GPS and RFID signals to create a virtual boundary around a geographic area of our choosing, thereby allowing us to determine when you are in proximity to a Little Caesars.\nIn addition to traditional GPS location-based services, some of the retailers and others we work with may install low power Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radio transmitters, or other devices in physical locations, which emit a signal that the App can detect to pinpoint your location or otherwise interact with the App (\u201ciBeacons\u201d).\nBecause iBeacons are more precise than GPS, we can improve the Services and send you more specific and relevant messages and offers.\nIn addition, we can track the efficiency of the service you receive from Little Caesars, by knowing when you enter or exit a Little Caesars or when you arrive in the parking lot for a carryout order.\nYou should consider the pros and cons involved in disclosing your location information to us and to other people.\nYour Device settings may enable you to disable, change or limit some of these activities (See Section 6 form more information).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Tracking Technologies Choices and Consent.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are giving you detailed notice of the Tracking Technologies and your limited choices regarding them so that your consent is meaningfully informed.\nWe may also provide you with a choice as to the level of data you share with us.\nThe Service may be limited and some features may not be available based on what data you elect and/or consent to share with us.\nFor more information on how to exercise preferences as to our features, functionality and communications, see Section 6, for choices regarding our service providers see Section 3(b),and for options regarding advertising and advertisers see Section 6(d).</p>\n<p>Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings.\nEach browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard.\nAlso, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies or other Tracking Technologies.\nFor information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe\u2019s website http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html.\nPlease be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of our Services may not work and that when you revisit our Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>\n<p>Tracking Technologies in connection with App usage outside of a browser can only be disabled by uninstalling the App.\nTo uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.</p>\n<p>For information on third party Tracking Technologies and browser Do Not Track signals, see the next section.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Third Party Tracking and Do Not Track.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Third parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service.\nThey may do so to enable the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.\nWe may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them.\nHowever, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking Technologies in connection with use of our Service and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy regarding our practices do not apply to the Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.\nFor more information on our vendors, and their Tracking Technologies, click here.</p>\n<p>Also, various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer\u2019s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services.\nCurrently, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these signals or other mechanisms.\nHowever, some of our vendors may.\nFor more information on their practices, click here.</p>c.\nInformation Third Parties Provide About You.<p>We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Service, when they submit content to us or post or interact with the Service.\nAdditionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties.\nTo the extent we combine information we receive from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Service, it will be treated as Personal Information and we will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise.\nFor persons outside of Canada, in no other circumstances do our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.</p>d.\nInteractions with Third-Party Services.<p>The Service has functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or application.\nThe use of this functionality can involve the third-party operator providing Personal Information, to us.\nYou may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account provided by a third-party site or application to interact with our Service.\nIf we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access or use our Service, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to us.\nIf so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service.\nIn addition, we may provide third-party sites\u2019 interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service.\nWe may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings.\nThese third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties\u2019 practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy.\nLCE may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.\nFurther, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices.\nYou should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Service.</p>e.\nInformation You Provide About a Third Party.<p>The Service may allow you to send someone else an invitation or other communication.\nIf so, the information you provide is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.\nYou must have the permission of your family member or friend to provide us with their personal information.\nYou may only provide email addresses of friends with whom you have had direct voluntary two-way communications, and with whom it is reasonable to conclude you have a personal relationship considering shared interests, experiences, opinions and other relevant factors.\nYou may only provide email addresses of family members with whom you are related by marriage, a common-law partnership, or parent-child relationship, and with whom you have had direct voluntary two-way communication.\nPlease be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Service, your contact information, name or user name and message may be included in the communication sent to your addressee(s), and the communication will indicate it was sent at your request and on your behalf.\nSome of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy policies as further detailed in Section 1(d) and Section 5.</p>\n<p>Return to policy summary and

of the Service, these Community Usage Rules (\u201c<strong>Rules</strong>\u201d) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the Service\u2019s online communities (\u201c<strong>Communities</strong>\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(i) Nature of Rules.</strong> Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Your User-Generated Content.</strong> All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms.\nYour User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.\nDo not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own.\nthis includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.\nIf anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the User-Generated Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to LCE.\n(For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to LCE as your User-Generated Content, then you must obtain your friend\u2019s and the photographer\u2019s permission to do so.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Speaking of Photos: No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.</strong> If you choose to submit photos to the Service, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know \u2013 and only if you have their express permission to submit it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Act Appropriately.</strong> All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.\nBe respectful of others\u2019 opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.\nIf you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn't belong on the Service.\nCursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.\nYour User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap.\nYour User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes.</strong> Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes.</strong> Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User-Generated Content.</strong> Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Others Can See.</strong> We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members.\nHowever, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and User-Generated Content that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users.\nDo not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, e-mail address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when disclosing this type of information to others.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Don\u2019t Share Other Peoples\u2019 Personal Information.</strong> Your User-Generated Content should not reveal another person\u2019s address, phone number, e-mail

individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by LCE and with the consent of that other person.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Don\u2019t Damage the Service or Anyone\u2019s Computers or Other Devices.</strong> Your User-Generated Content must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you submit User-Generated Content that LCE reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.\nHowever, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law.\nWe may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.\nFailure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the User-Generated Content in question being removed from the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(ii) Your Interactions With Other Users.\nDisputes.</strong> You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline.\nWe are not responsible or liable for the conduct or

pursuant to the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act.\nYou and LCE agree that we intend that this Section 12 satisfies the \u201cwriting\u201d requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nThis Section 12 can only be amended by mutual agreement.\nAll matters arising under or related to this Section 12 shall be conducted exclusively in the English language.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nFirst \u2013 Try To Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.</strong> If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Content, your User-Generated Content, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, \u201c<strong>Dispute</strong>\u201d), or to any of LCE\u2019s actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an \u201c<strong>Excluded Dispute</strong>\u201d, which includes those actions set forth in Section 12.D, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.\nOur notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.\nBut if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 12.A.\nYour notice to us must be sent to: Little Caesar Enterprises, Inc.\n(Attn: Legal Notices), 2211 Woodward Ave, Detroit, MI 48201.\nFor a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, LCE and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or LCE to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and LCE, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nForums For Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(i) Arbitration.</strong> If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 12.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 12.B.\nIf we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 12.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and LCE consent, in a writing signed by you and an Officer or legal representative of LCE, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration.\nIn such a case, (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a \u201cDispute\u201d for the remainder of this Section 12.B.\n</p>\n<p> Upon expiration of the applicable sixty-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d).\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years\u2019 experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nIf the Dispute has acclaimed value of more than $250,000, or if LCE elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules.\nThe arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.\nIf you and LCE do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 12.B(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 12.B will not apply to the Excluded Dispute.</p>\n<p> If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a \u201cdemand for arbitration,\u201d then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.\n(\u201c<strong>JAMS</strong>\u201d) using JAMS\u2019 streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of LCE consent to in writing.\nThe substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for a the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration service.</p>\n<p> You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:</p>\n<p> AAA: 800.778.7879 &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nJAMS: 949.224.1810<br>\nhttp://www.adr.org/ &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nhttp://www.jamsadr.com/</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(ii) Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution.</strong> In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys\u2019 fees).\nHowever, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.\nAll parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.\nIf an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the \u201cmetropolitan statistical area\u201d (as defined by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau) where you are a resident, or nearest to your place of residence at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.\nYou and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator\u2019s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.\nbut if applicable arbitration rules or laws require LCE to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 12 to be enforceable, then LCE will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration, or to decline to do so and have the matter resolved through the courts.\nDiscovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.\nJudgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nLimited Time To File Claims.</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 12.A) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES \u2013 OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D.\nInjunctive Relief.</strong> The foregoing provisions of this Section 12 will not apply to any legal action taken by LCE to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Service, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or LCE\u2019s intellectual property rights (including such LCE may claim that may be in dispute), LCE\u2019s operations, and/or LCE\u2019s products or services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E.\nSmall Claims Matters Are Excluded From Arbitration Requirement.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 12.G.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>F.\nNo Class Action Matters.</strong> Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.\nBut if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 12.B(i) holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 12.B to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 12.G.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>G.\nFederal and State Courts in Detroit.</strong> For users of the Services who are not individuals resident in Quebec, except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 12.B, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal
