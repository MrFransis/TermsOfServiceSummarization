policy, we do not sell, rent, or share any of your Personal Information, including your email address, to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.\nHowever, the following describes some of the ways that your Personal Information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services and products to customers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Purpose</u>: We may disclose your Personal Information to fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Legal Requests</u>: Company cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you, other users, and Company from bad actors.\nTherefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, username history, and fraud complaints without a subpoena.\nWithout limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or report suspected illegal activity.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Other Disclosures</u>: We may also disclose your Personal Information if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our customers, or others.\nThis includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other Personal Information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Statement.\nBy way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose Personal Information, including your email address, to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your Personal Information that they collect from Company.\nTherefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should neither rely upon nor expect, that your Personal Information or private communications will always remain private.</p>\n<p>We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nCookies and Related Technologies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you use the Site, we collect certain information by automated electronic means, in accordance with our Cookie Statement, available at www.dash.org.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nManage Your Security Settings</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may manage how your browser handles cookies and

your mobile browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting your mobile device privacy and security settings.\nPlease refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.</p>\n<p>If you wish to opt out of receiving offers directly from any third party service providers, you can follow the opt-out instructions in the emails that they send you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nRights to Access and Control Your Personal Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any personal data that we collect is based upon your

to, or Limit or Restrict, Use of Data:</strong>&nbsp;You may request that we do not use your Personal Information, but keep in mind that this will terminate our ability to provide any Service(s) to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Access and/or Take Your Data:</strong>&nbsp;You can ask&nbsp;us for a copy of your Personal Information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may send us an email at contact@dash.org

address, if applicable), (ii) your contact information, and (iii) information about the specific changes, deletions, or other action(s) you are requesting.\nWe require this information so we can

are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\nTo make such a request, please send an email to contact@dash.org.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nSecurity</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect Personal Information, including your email address, submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\nHowever, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.\nTherefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.&nbsp.\nAny transmission of personal information is at your own risk.\nWe are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site.</p>\n<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you.\nWhere we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.\nWe ask you not to share your password with anyone.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nChildren Under the Age of 13</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13.\nIf you believe that a child has provided us with Personal Information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please contact us at contact@dash.org.\nIf we become aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u00a9 2019 Dash Core Group, Inc.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-02-06 19:59:34.508812", "updated_at": "2021-02-06 19:59:43.050262"}, {"id":
