language information in order to better offer services like showing available tutoring times in your local time zone and offering translations in your native language.\n</li>\n<li> LingQ allows you to sign up and log in to the Services using accounts you create with third-party products and services, such as Facebook or Google (collectively, \u201cThird-Party Accounts\u201d).\nIf you access the Services with <strong>Third-Party Accounts</strong> we will collect information that you have agreed to make available such as your name, email address, profile information and preferences with the applicable Third-Party Account.\nThis information is collected by the Third-Party Account provider and is provided to LingQ under their privacy policies.\nYou can generally control the information

collect information from your browser, computer, or mobile device, which provide us with <strong>technical information</strong> when you access or use the Services.\nThis technical information includes device and network information, cookies, log files and analytics information.\n</li>\n</ul> Cookies and Similar Technologies <p> When you visit the Services, a cookie will be stored on your computer.\nGenerally, cookies and similar technologies work by assigning to your browser or device a unique number that has no meaning outside of LingQ.\nLingQ uses these technologies to personalize your experience and to assist in delivering content specific to your interests.\nAdditionally, after you\u2019ve entered your member ID and password during a session on the Services, LingQ saves that information so you don\u2019t have to re-enter it repeatedly during that session.\n</p>\n<p> Most browsers automatically accept cookies.\nTo manage the collection of information through cookies or other equivalent technology you can use the settings on your browser or mobile device.\nLingQ is committed to providing you choices to manage your privacy and sharing.\nHowever, LingQ does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the internet industry has not fully developed Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.\nTo learn more about Do Not Track signals, you can visit https://allaboutdnt.com.\nNot accepting cookies may make certain features of the Services unavailable to you.\nLingQ may also use your IP address to identify you, to administer the Services and to assist in diagnosing problems with LingQ\u2019s servers.\n</p> Log Files <p> The Services use log files.\nStored information includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.\nThis information is used to analyze trends, administer, protect and secure the Services, track member movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.\nIP addresses, etc., may be linked to session IDs, user IDs and device identifiers.\n</p> How LingQ Uses Information <p> LingQ uses the information we collect and receive to administer and operate the Services and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.\nFor example, we use your learning information to provide you with statistics and visualizations representing key data points like known words.\nYour information, including your profile, username, photos, members you follow and who follow you, groups you belong to, your activities, and likes and comments you give and receive will be shared on LingQ to participate in the Services, for example to show your place in the rankings.\n</p>\n<p> We also use your information to analyze, develop and improve the Services.\nTo do this, LingQ may use third party analytics providers to gain insights into how our Services are used and to help us improve the Services.\nWe may also use your information to market the Services, credit or accept payments, provide support related to the Services, protect members and enforce our Terms of Service, promote safety, and communicate with you.\nAdditionally, your information may be shared with third parties, as set forth below.\n</p>\n<p> LingQ may de-identify or aggregate the content you make available in connection with the Services, in ways that do not personally identify you.\nExamples of such aggregated information or statistical data include information about equipment, usage, demographics, languages and performance.\nLingQ may use, sell, license, and share this information with third parties for research, business or other purposes such as to improve language acquisition.\nPlease visit your privacy settings if you object to LingQ using your information for these purposes.\n</p>\n<p> We use your information to communicate with you about the Services, send you marketing communications (where you have agreed to receive such messages), or let you know about new features or updates to our Terms of Service.\nWe also use your information to respond to you when you contact us.\nLingQ will use your information to communicate with you, for example by sending you notifications.\n</p> How Information is Shared Service Providers <p> We may share your information with third parties who provide services to LingQ such as supporting and improving the Services, promoting the Services, processing payments, or fulfilling orders.\nThese service providers will only have access to the information necessary to perform these limited functions on our behalf and are required to protect and secure your information.\nWe may also engage service providers to collect information about your use of the Services over time on our behalf so that we or they may promote LingQ or display information that may be relevant to your interests on the Services or other websites or services.\n</p> Publicly Available Information <p> Subject to your privacy settings, your information and content may be publicly accessible.\n</p> Third Party Business via API or Other Integrations <p> When you choose to use third party apps, plug-ins, or websites that integrate with the Services, they may receive your information and content, including your personal information, photos, and your activity data (including private activities).\nInformation collected by these third parties is subject to their terms and policies.\nLingQ is not responsible for the terms or policies of third parties.\n</p> Affiliates and Acquirors of our Business or Assets <p> We may share your information with affiliates under common control with us, who are required to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with regard to your information.\nIf LingQ becomes involved in a business combination, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution or other similar transaction, we may share or transfer your information in connection with such transaction.\n</p> Legal Requirements <p> We may preserve and share your information with third parties, including law enforcement, public or governmental agencies, or private litigants, within or outside your country of residence, if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, including to respond to court orders, warrants, subpoenas, or other legal or regulatory process.\nWe may also retain, preserve or disclose your information if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate to prevent any person from death or serious bodily injury, to address issues of national security or other issues of public importance, to prevent or detect violations of our Terms of Service or fraud or abuse of LingQ or its members, or to protect our operations or our property or other legal rights, including by disclosure to our legal counsel and other consultants and third parties in connection with actual or potential litigation.\n</p> DMCA Notices <p> We may share your information with third parties when we forward Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notifications, which will be forwarded as submitted to us without any deletions.\n</p> How We Protect Information <p> We take several measures to safeguard the collection, transmission and storage of the data we collect.\nAlthough we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content.\nNo system is 100% secure.\nThe Services uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information and credit card numbers.\nLingQ engages a company that is an industry leader in online security and Services verification to strengthen the security of LingQ\u2019s Services.\nThe Services are registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can confirm LingQ\u2019s identity before any personally identifiable information is sent.\nIn addition, LingQ\u2019s secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall technology.\n</p>\n<p> To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorized access to your private information, you should be aware of the security features available to you through your browser.\nYou should use a security-enabled browser to submit your credit card information and other personal information at the Services.\nPlease note that if you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data intercepted.\n</p>\n<p> Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between secure and insecure communications, receive invalid services identification information for the Services you are communicating with, or send information over an unsecured connection.\nLingQ recommends that you enable these browser functions to help ensure that your communications are secure.\nYou can also monitor the URL of the services you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than http://), along with the security symbol of your browser to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server.\nYou can also view the details of the security certificate of the services to which you are connected.\nPlease check the validity of any Services you connect to using secure communications.\n</p> Disclaimer <p> While LingQ continues to work hard to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and LingQ cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to LingQ.\nTransmitting personal information is done at your own risk.\n</p> Managing Your Settings Adjust Notification and Email Preferences <p> LingQ offers various ways to manage the notifications you receive.\nYou can choose to stop receiving certain emails and notifications by indicating your preference at https://www.lingq.com/en/settings/#notifications-email.\nYou may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained at the bottom of each type of email.\nAny administrative or service-related emails (to confirm a purchase, or an update to this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service, etc.) generally do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the Services you requested.\n</p> Updating Account Information <p> You may correct, amend or update profile or account information that is inaccurate at any time by adjusting that information in your account settings.\nIf you need further assistance, please contact LingQ at support@LingQ.com.\nLingQ will generally respond to your request within 7-10 business days.\n</p> Deleting Information and Accounts <p> You may request that your account is deleted by visiting https://www.lingq.com/settings/#account.\nOnce deleted, your data, including your account, activities and place on leaderboards cannot be reinstated.\n</p>\n<p> Note that content you have shared with others (for example, through lessons) or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have deleted your account or deleted the information from your own profile.\nYour public profile may be displayed in search engine results until the search engine refreshes its cache.\n</p> EU Members\u2019 Rights <p> If you are habitually located in the European Union, you have the right to access, rectify, download or erase your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information.\nWhile some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited circumstances.\nWe describe these rights below: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Access and Porting You can access much of your information by logging into your account.\nIf you require additional access or if you are not a LingQ member, contact us at support@lingq.com.\nTo download a copy of your data,

legitimate interests explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances.\nIn such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons.\n</li>\n<li> Revoke consent Where you have previously provided your consent, such as to permit us to process language related data about you, you have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your information at any time.\nFor example, you can withdraw your consent by emailing support@lingq.com.\nIn certain cases, we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn consent if we have a legal basis to do so or if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.\n</li>\n<li> Complain Should you wish to raise a concern about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.\n</li>\n</ul> Transfers <p> The Services are operated from the United States.\nIf you are located outside of the United States and choose to use the Services or provide information to us, you acknowledge and understand that your information will be transferred, processed and stored in the United States, as it is necessary to provide the Services and perform the Terms of Service.\nUnited States privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.\n</p> Retention of Information <p> We retain information as long as it is necessary to provide the Services to you and others, subject to any legal obligations to further retain such information.\nInformation associated with your account will generally be kept until it is no longer necessary to provide the Services or until you ask us to delete it or your account is deleted whichever comes first.\nFor example, where you withdraw your consent to LingQ processing your language learning information, LingQ will delete all language learning related information you uploaded.\nFollowing your deletion of your account, it may take up to 30 days to fully delete your personal information and system logs from our systems.\nAdditionally, we may retain information from deleted accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce the Terms of Service and take other actions permitted by law.\nThe information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p> Information about you that is no longer necessary and relevant to provide our Services may be de-identified and aggregated with other non-personal data to provide insights which are commercially valuable to LingQ, such as statistics of the use of the Services.\nFor example, we may retain popular lesson usage information, topic information and other depersonalized preference information to continue to improve the Services and to improve the Lesson Feed and provision of suitable content.\nThis information will be de-associated with your name and other identifiers.\n</p> Other LingQ Sites <p> LingQ maintains certain websites that can be accessed outside of https://www.LingQ.com, such as https://www.LingQ.com/blog, https://www.thelinguist.com, https://blog.thelinguist.com (the \u201cOther Sites\u201d).\nThe Other Sites maintain the look and feel of the Services, but are hosted by outside service providers with their own terms and privacy policies.\nIf you interact with the Other Sites, your information may be stored, processed, or shared outside of the Services.\nIf you interact with the Other Sites, you acknowledge that you may be subject to the terms and conditions and policies applicable to such Other Site.\nPlease be aware that any personal information you submit to the Other Sites may be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums indefinitely, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.\nLingQ is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit via the Other Sites.\n</p> Privacy Policy Information <p> LingQ reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.\nPlease review it occasionally.\nIf LingQ makes changes to this Privacy Policy, the updated Privacy Policy will be posted on the Services in a timely manner and, if we make material changes, we will provide a prominent notice.\nIf you object to any of the changes to this Privacy Policy, you should stop using the Services and delete your account.\n</p>\n<p> \u00a9 2018 LingQ </p> ", "created_at": "2021-12-19 21:40:21.733557", "updated_at": "2021-12-19 20:40:52.030223"}], "points": [], "urls":
