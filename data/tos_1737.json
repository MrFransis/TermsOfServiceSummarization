applies and disputes will be settled by English\ncourts) are between you and Monzo Bank Limited (Monzo/us/we) and you agree to\nthem by using the Monzo app.\nYour Monzo account is a personal UK current account\nand you mustn't use it for business purposes.</p>\n<p>You should read this document along with our\nData Privacy Notice.</p>\nHow to contact us \ud83d\udcac\n<p>You can contact us through the Monzo app.</p>\n<p>Email us at help@monzo.com.</p>\n<p>Phone us on 0800 8021281.</p>\n<p>Or send a letter to: Monzo, Broadwalk House, 5 Appold St, London, EC2A 2AG.</p>\nHow we'll contact you and send documents \ud83d\udc4b\n<p>Using the Monzo app, email, phone or mail to your home address, we'll:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>contact you in English \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 and Emoji\ud83d\ude03</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>send you any agreements, statements and other notices.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any of your contact details change, you must let us know as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>We also send you instant notifications when you spend or receive money.</p>\nMaking payments \ud83d\udcb8\nYou need enough money in your account to make payments\n<p>But some transactions that would take your balance below zero\nmay still go through.\nIf that\nhappens, we'll let you know the amount you'll need to repay before the\nend of the day and you'll need to pay us back as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>If you agree to pay for products like Monzo Plus or Monzo Premium,\nyou must have enough money in your account to make the monthly payments.\nIf you don't, those fees may still go through and take you into an arranged\nor unarranged overdraft as explained in the product's separate terms and conditions.</p>\nIf you go into an unarranged overdraft\n<p>If you go over your arranged overdraft limit, or we haven't agreed an overdraft\nlimit with you and your balance goes below zero, we call this an \u2018unarranged'\noverdraft.\nWe'll charge an interest rate of 33.4% per year (variable) which is\nequivalent to a rate of 39% EAR (variable).\nIf you have an arranged overdraft\nwith us with a lower rate than this, that lower rate will apply instead.\nThe\nmonthly cap on unarranged overdraft charges for your current account is \u00a315.50.</p>\n<p>We'll calculate any interest based on how much you're overdrawn by at midnight Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)\neach day, and charge your account on the first day of each month.</p>\n<p>When we calculate the amount you're overdrawn by, we'll exclude any money you've\nagreed to put aside in \u2018Pots'.\nMoney in Pots isn't part of your available\nbalance, so you can still go overdrawn even if you have money in Pots.\nWe'll decline any payments (including standing orders and Direct Debits) that would take\nyou over your available balance, unless you have an overdraft.</p>\nWe may block your payments if:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>your instructions are unclear</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>we suspect criminal activity on your account</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>we're not legally allowed to make the transfer</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>it goes over your payment limits (you'll find these in your app.\nthey'll change over time).</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we block a payment, we'll let you know as soon as possible, using one of\nour usual channels.</p>\n<p>You can find information on all your transactions in your feed and your regular\nbank statements in the app.</p>\nWe can take money you owe us from your available credit balance\n<p>You might miss loan or overdraft repayments, break your credit agreement or\nnot repay when we ask you to.\nIf this happens, we have the right to reduce\nor pay off debt you owe us using any available credit balance in your account.</p>\nPayment types\n<p>There are lots of ways you can send money with Monzo.\nThey each work differently,\nand we need different information from you to make them.</p>\nBank transfer\n<p>To make a bank transfer we need the name, account number and sort code, and account type\n(personal or business) of who you're sending money to.\nYou'll need to enter your PIN or prove it's you using your fingerprint or\nfacial recognition to consent to the transfer.\nIf you schedule a future payment,\nwe'll treat it as you giving consent on the payment date.\nOnce you've given your consent you can't cancel the transfer.\nTransfers sent using Faster Payments usually go through instantly, but can take up to 2 hours.\nOther bank transfers can take up to 1 working day.</p>\nPaying or moving money between Monzo accounts\n<p>To pay someone with a Monzo account they need to be a contact in your phone.\nYou'll need to input the account you wish to make the payment to/from.\nYou'll need to enter your PIN or prove it's you using your fingerprint or facial recognition\nto consent to the payment or movement of money.\nOnce you've given your consent you can't cancel the payment.\nPayments usually go through instantly, but can take up to 1 working day.</p>\nStanding order\n<p>For standing orders we need a name, account number, sort code, account type (personal or business),\npayment date and whether it's a one-off or recurring payment.\nYou'll need to enter your PIN\nor prove it's you using your fingerprint or facial recognition to consent to creating the standing order.\nYou can set up and cancel standing orders instantly in the app.\nOnes to other Monzo accounts\nwill normally arrive immediately.\nStanding orders to other banks will normally arrive on the same day,\nbut some organisations may take longer to credit their customers' accounts.\nFuture payments will go out at 2:00am (UTC) on the day you schedule them for.\nTo stop a scheduled payment going out you'll need to cancel the standing order before 2:00am on the day the payment's due.</p>\nDirect Debit\n<p>For Direct Debits we need to know the account number and sort code of the person or business you're paying.\nTo consent to a Direct Debit you need to contact the person or business and\ngive them your sort code and account number.\nWe only support making Direct Debit payments, not receiving them.</p>\n<p>In terms of timings, we get the payment order the working day before we take the money from your account.\nYou'll see it in your account as a scheduled payment.\nWe'll collect the money at 2:00am (UTC) the day after we get the order.</p>\n<p>Cancelling a Direct Debit takes a working day to process.\nTo stop a payment going out, you need to cancel 2 working days before a payment's due.</p>\nCheque\n<p>To pay a cheque into your Monzo account you'll need your account number and sort code.\nWrite them on the back of the cheque in the top left corner and post it to us.</p>\n<p>Once we've got your cheque we'll let you know in the app.\nWe usually process your cheque\nwithin 4 working days, unless we're stopped for technical, regulatory or legal reasons.</p>\nPaying with your card abroad \ud83c\udfdd\n<p>Spending with your Monzo card is free anywhere around the world, and should work anywhere that accepts Mastercard.</p>\n<p>When you make a payment in a foreign currency or take out cash abroad, we use Mastercard's exchange rate with a 0.0% fee.</p>\nTaking out cash \ud83d\udcb3\n<p>We won't charge you for withdrawing money from an ATM in the UK or in the\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA) if you meet the Fee Criteria listed in our \u2018Fees and charges' section at the time you make the withdrawal.</p>\n<p>If you don't meet the Fee Criteria at the time you make the withdrawal, you can withdraw up to \u00a3250 from an ATM in the UK or the EEA in any rolling 30-day period without any fees.\nAfter that, we charge 3% of the total amount you withdraw over \u00a3250.</p>\n<p>You can withdraw up to \u00a3200 from ATMs outside the EEA in any rolling 30-day period without any fees.\nAfter that, we charge 3% of the total amount you withdraw above \u00a3200.\nFor some ATMs you may need to turn on the \u2018magnetic stripe' rather than using chip and PIN.\nYou can do this in the app.</p>\n<p>If you have both a Monzo personal and Monzo joint account, you have one fee-free ATM allowance across both.</p>\nYour money is protected by the FSCS \ud83d\udcb0\n<p>Any money in your Monzo account is fully protected up to \u00a385,000 by the\nFinancial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).</p>\n16-17 year olds \ud83d\udc66\n<p>If you're under 18 you won't be able to apply for an arranged overdraft or loan and we\nwon't charge any fees if you go into an unarranged overdraft.\nYou also won't be\nable to make some payments for things like gambling.\nFrom the age of 18, we'll\ncharge you at the current rate if you use an unarranged overdraft.</p>\nYou agree to us using your information \ud83e\udd1d\n<p>By accepting these terms, you agree to us using your information to make and\nreceive payments on your account.\nIf you're no longer happy for us to use your\ninformation, we'll have to close your account.\nBut we may keep your personal\ndata and use it where we have lawful grounds to do so.\nFor example, any records\nwe need to keep for regulatory reasons (see our\nData Privacy Notice).</p>\nFees and Charges \ud83d\udcb5\n<p>Here are our fees for using the main services on your current account.\nYou may have to pay other costs, taxes or charges in relation to your Monzo account, which are outside of our control and not charged by us.\nFor example, other banks may charge you for sending money to your Monzo account.</p>\n<p>You won't pay some of our fees if you meet any of the criteria below (our \u2018Fee Criteria'):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>At least \u00a3500 was paid into a Monzo account in your name over the last rolling 35-day period, and you have at least one active Direct Debit on the same account in the same period.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You've received a Department for Work and Pensions or a Department for Communities payment into a Monzo account in your name over the last rolling 35-day period.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You've received a student loan payment into a Monzo account in your name over the last rolling 8-month period.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You're sharing a Monzo Joint Account with someone who has done at least one of the above.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We'll tell you in these terms and conditions where fees won't apply if you meet the Fee Criteria.</p>\nReplacement cards\n<p>We'll never charge you for replacements where your card expires, is faulty, has been stolen, has been swallowed by an ATM or if we've cancelled your card because we're concerned about fraud.</p>\n<p>But we do charge a \u00a35 fee for replacement cards for other reasons (including if you lose your card).\nYou'll get up to two replacement Monzo cards per account per year for any reason without paying the \u00a35 fee if you meet the Fee Criteria when you order a replacement card.</p>\n<p>If you need us to post your replacement card to somewhere outside the UK, we'll charge you the international card fee of \u00a330 in all circumstances.</p>\nWhen we offer rewards \ud83c\udf81\n<p>Sometimes we'll offer rewards for things like inviting friends to join Monzo or\nswitching to Monzo using the Current Account Switching Service (CASS).\nWe can withdraw or change these offers any time, without letting you know in advance.</p>\n<p>You'll only get financial awards once per action (for\nexample you'll only get a bonus for CASS switching once, or once per friend you\ninvite).\nYou might have to pay income tax on money you get as part of these\nrewards.\nContact HMRC if you're unsure.</p>\nIf something goes wrong \ud83d\ude31\n<p>Please keep your phone, card and PIN safe at all times.\nIf we find any\nsecurity issues affecting your account, we'll contact you as soon as possible in\nthe most secure way, using one of our usual channels.</p>\n<p>If you lose your card or see transactions in the app that look wrong,\nyou must freeze your card and tell\nus as soon as possible.\nIf you don't let us know within 13 months from the date\nthe money leaves your account you might not be able to get the money back.</p>\n<p>If someone pays money into your account by mistake you give us permission to return it.</p>\n<p>If you've used your card to make a payment which didn't specify the exact amount (for example when hiring a car),\nand the final amount is higher than you could reasonably have expected, we'll give you a refund.\nYou'll need to tell us within 8 weeks of the transaction, and give us any information we reasonably ask for to investigate.</p>\n<p>Errors with Direct Debits are covered by the\nDirect Debit guarantee scheme.</p>\nOur responsibility to you \ud83e\udd1d\n<p>Since you're only allowed to use your account for personal use, we're not responsible\nto you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.\nThis applies to you using your account for personal use, as well as if you wrongly use it for\ncommercial or business purposes.</p>\n<p>None of these terms affect your legal rights as a consumer.\nYou can find more information on the\nCompetition and Markets Authority\u2019s\nor Financial Ombudsman Service\u2019s websites.\nThese terms don't exclude or limit our liability to you where it\u2019s against the law for us to do so.</p>\n<p>We're responsible to you for any foreseeable loss and damage which we cause.\nWhen we say \u2018foreseeable',\nthis means we could or should have expected those losses.\nThis includes if we breach the terms of\nthis contract or fail to use reasonable care or skill providing services to you.</p>\n<p>For example, we\u2019ll usually refund your money if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>it was taken after you froze your card in the app, unless you acted fraudulently</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>we should've applied strong customer authentication but we didn't, unless you acted fraudulently</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>someone makes a payment without your permission.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We'll also refund any money you lose if we make mistakes with your payments.\nWe can help by speaking to other banks to make sure they treat any payment\nwe send late as if it was sent on time.</p>\n<p>Examples of when you won't be able to claim back money you\u2019ve lost may include if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>you gave us incorrect instructions or we can prove that the bank we sent your payment to received it (although we'll still try to help you recover your money)</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>you purposefully didn't keep your phone, card or PIN safe, you were very negligent in not keeping them safe, you gave them to someone else, or if your account is in overdraft</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>you acted fraudulently.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We're not responsible for any loss or damage (direct or indirect) caused by something\nbeyond our reasonable control.\nWe\u2019re also not responsible for any loss or damage (direct and indirect)\nif something was unavoidable despite us using reasonable care and skill to avoid it.</p>\n<p>This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>hardware breakdowns</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>actions or decisions taken to comply with legal or regulatory requirements</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>delays or failures caused by third party industrial action</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>problems with a third party system or network (including power outages)</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>data-processing failures.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So you won\u2019t be able to claim back money you lost if your losses resulted from\ncircumstances that we couldn\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t have been expected to know about.</p>\nClosing your account\n<p>Once this agreement has started it won't end until you or we end it.\nYou can cancel\nyour account within the first 14 days of opening it, or close it\nat any other time.\nIf you'd like to, please get in touch with us.\nYou'll need to\nrepay any money you owe us before we can close your account.\nOnce we've closed\nit, your card won't work and you won't be able to access your account.</p>\n<p>We can close your account by giving you at least two months' notice.\nWe may\nclose your account or stop you using your card and app immediately if we believe\nyou've:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>broken the terms of this agreement</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>put us in a position where we might break the law</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>broken the law or attempted to break the law</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>given us false information at any time</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>been abusive to anyone at Monzo or a member of our community.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\nHow to make a complaint\n<p>If you have a complaint, please contact us and we'll do our best to fix the\nproblem.</p>\n<p>If you're still not happy, you can refer your complaint to the Financial\nOmbudsman Service.</p>\nMaking changes \ud83d\udcdd\n<p>This agreement will always be available in the app and on our website.</p>\n<p>We can make changes from time to time to our charges, interest rates, or the terms of this\nagreement or the terms of any other agreement which these terms apply to.\nThis includes introducing new charges or rates and charging in a different way.\nWe may make these changes, including fees we charge, because of changes to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>law, regulation, industry codes or Financial Ombudsman, court or regulator decisions</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>the way we run our business</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>the cost of providing your account and running our business, for example a change in our cost of funding, technology (including our systems) and service costs</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>the banking or financial services system.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can make favourable changes to these terms and charges for any reason.\nWe\ncan also make proportionate changes for any other balanced and valid reason that\nimpacts us or your account.</p>\n<p>If we make changes to it that are clearly in your favour, we'll tell you once\nwe've made them.\nOtherwise we'll give you two months' notice and tell you our\nreasons in the most secure way, using one of our usual channels.</p>\n<p>If you don't agree to these changes, you can let us know and we'll close your\naccount fee-free.\nWe'll transfer any money in the account to another account\nof yours, and you'll need to pay back any money you owe us.\nIf we don't hear\nfrom you before the changes come into effect, we'll assume that you're happy and\naccept the changes we've made.</p>\n<p>\n<small>Monzo Bank Limited, authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the

data.\nThis is information that can reveal a person\u2019s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership, as well as genetic or biometric data (if used for identification purposes) and information concerning a person\u2019s health, sex life or sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>Data protection laws say we need a second lawful basis to use special category data.\nThis can be: explicit consent, exercising legal rights in the field of employment, protecting vital interests, establishing, defending or exercising legal claims or reasons of substantial public interest.\nIn this section we explain which lawful basis we rely on to use your special category data in a certain way.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>It\u2019s necessary for reasons of substantial public interest</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use facial recognition technology to identify people who use our services in the Monzo app.\nWe do this because it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest to prevent or detect unlawful acts</li>\n<li>record information about your health if it\u2019s necessary to protect your economic well-being if you\u2019re at risk, and seeking consent would be unreasonable or negatively impact our ability to help you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>It's necessary to protect your or another person\u2019s vital

name).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>companies that make our Monzo cards</li>\n<li>card producers and networks, like MasterCard</li>\n<li>Know Your Customer (KYC) service providers that help us with identity

agencies (CRAs) give lenders information about borrowers to help them make responsible lending decisions.\nBanks share details about their customers to help CRAs maintain up-to-date information about people\u2019s financial status.\nWe work with TransUnion, Experian and Equifax.</p>\n<p>When you sign up and for as long as you\u2019re a customer, we\u2019ll exchange details about you with CRAs.\nThis includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your name, address and date of birth</li>\n<li>accounts you have, including when you opened them and money going into them (if you owe us money, we\u2019ll also share your balance)</li>\n<li>credit applications you\u2019ve made and limits you\u2019ve turned on</li>\n<li>if you\u2019ve borrowed, details of your loan and repayments (like whether you repay in full and on time)</li>\n<li>fraud prevention information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll use this information to to comply with our legal duties and when it\u2019s in our \u2018legitimate interest\u2019

repayments if you borrow</li>\n<li>manage your account with us</li>\n<li>trace and recover debts</li>\n<li>make sure our offers are relevant for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you apply for a joint account with someone else, we and CRAs will link your records with theirs.</p>\n<p>For more information about how the CRAs we work with use your data, read TransUnion, Equifax and Experian\u2019s Credit Reference Agency Information Notices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fraud prevention agencies</strong>.\nWhen you apply for an account, we check your record with fraud prevention agencies (FPAs) like Cifas.\nDuring the application process and after you become a customer, we may share information about you with them to help prevent fraud and money laundering when it\u2019s in our \u2018legitimate interest\u2019.\nIf we detect fraud, we may stop activity on your account or block access.\nOther organisations may use information we share with FPAs about fraud to refuse their services, finance or employment.\nFor more information about the details we collect from and share with Cifas and how they\u2019ll use your data, see Cifas\u2019 Fair Processing Notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Anyone you give

reasons</li>\n<li>the police, courts or dispute resolution bodies if we have to</li>\n<li>other banks to help trace money if you\u2019re a victim of fraud or other crimes or if there\u2019s a dispute about a payment</li>\n<li>any other third parties where necessary to meet our legal obligations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also share your details with people or companies if there\u2019s a corporate

with Monzo Inc for other lawful reasons if you open a US Monzo account (this is only available to US residents).</p>\nMonzo Plus and Monzo Premium\n<p>If you sign up for Monzo Premium, we\u2019ll share your name and contact details with our insurance and airport lounge partners so they can provide the services you get through Monzo Premium.\nWe also share your account details, so insurance partners can pay you if you make a successful insurance claim, and we share your payment details so we can collect payments you owe us for using lounge access benefits.\nOur legal basis for sharing your information for these reasons is \u2018contractual necessity\u2019: we need to use your data for a contract we have with you.\nTo learn how our partners will use your information, please

this information with the Google company that manages your account until you pause exports or remove access.\nWe\u2019ll have access to your spreadsheet, but won\u2019t collect the information in it.</p>\nWhen we make automated decisions \ud83d\udcf2\n<p>We sometimes use computers to make decisions.\nWe do this for deciding if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>we can give you a Monzo account based on your age, residency, nationality, financial position and other circumstances, like the results of anti-money laundering and sanctions checks</li>\n<li>we can give you an arranged overdraft or loan based on information we hold about you, and information we get from credit reference agencies.\nThis includes details on whether you\u2019ve kept up to date with payments on any credit accounts, and if you\u2019ve been to court</li>\n<li>we need to take action, like freeze a transaction or account, because we suspect fraud or money-laundering against Monzo or a customer.\nOur computers decide this based on patterns in our data, like an account or policy being used in a way that fraudsters work</li>\n<li>our services and products, or those of companies we work with, are suitable for you so that we can tailor our marketing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can ask for a member of the team to review a decision via Monzo Chat.\nIf your application for a Monzo account was rejected, you can ask us to check this decision by emailing review@monzo.com.</p>\nHow long we keep your information \ud83d\udcc1\n<p>We keep most of your data as long as you\u2019re using Monzo, and for 6 years after that to comply with the law and if we face a legal challenge.\nIn some circumstances, like cases of anti-money laundering or fraud, we may keep data longer if we need to (that\u2019s in our legitimate interest) and/or the law says we have to.</p>\n<p>To work out how long we keep different categories of data, we consider why we hold it, how sensitive it is, how long the law says we need to keep it for, and what the risks are.</p>\nYour rights \u2705\n<p>You have a right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>access the personal data we hold about you, or to get a copy of it</li>\n<li>ask for a copy of your personal data in

might not always be able to do it</li>\n<li>say no to us using your data for direct marketing and in certain other \u2018legitimate interest\u2019 circumstances</li>\n<li>withdraw any consent you\u2019ve given us</li>\n<li>ask a member of staff to review a computer-made (automated) decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To do any of these things, please contact us through the app or by emailing
