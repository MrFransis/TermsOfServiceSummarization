that significantly disrupt our hCaptcha business.\nSince the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur.\nWith that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.<br>\n<br>\u200d<strong>Contacting Us</strong> \u2013 If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at support@hcaptcha.com, you should go to our website at hcaptcha.com or imachines.com, or hcaptchastatus.com.<br>\n<br>\u200d<strong>Our Business Continuity Plan</strong> \u2013 We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm\u2019s books and records, and allowing our customers and their end users to transact online.\nIn short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business continuity plan addresses: data backup and recovery.\nall mission critical systems.\nfinancial and operational assessments.\nalternative communications with customers, employees, and oversight bodies.\nalternate physical location of employees.\ncritical supplier and customer impact.\nregulatory reporting.\nand giving our customers prompt notice if we are unable to continue our business.&nbsp;Our core supplier pool backs up our important records in a geographically separate area.\nWhile every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by this supplier pool that their objective is to restore their own operations and be able to resume services rapidly.\nAlthough we have worked to reduce risk by using a diverse set of suppliers, your services could be modified or interrupted during this period.<br>\n<strong>\n<br>Varying Disruptions </strong>\u2013 Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the neighborhood where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region.\nWithin each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe.\nIn a disruption to our firm, our business district, city, or region or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when needed and expect no material disruption to business operations.\nIn either situation, we plan to continue in business, transfer operations to alternative suppliers if necessary, and notify you through our website at hcaptcha.com and our status page at hcaptchastatus.com as to how to contact us.\nIf the significant business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in business, we will notify you expeditiously.<br>\u200d<br>\n<strong>For more information</strong> \u2013 If you have questions about our business continuity planning, you can contact us at
