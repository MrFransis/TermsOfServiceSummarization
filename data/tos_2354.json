the accuracy of your personal data, we will restrict processing it for a period enabling us to verify its accuracy.</li>\n<li>The processing is unlawful and you oppose its erasure and request instead the restriction of its use.</li>\n<li>We no longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require us to restrict processing for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li>\n<li>You have objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether our legitimate grounds override yours.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Right to data portability.</em> Upon request, we will provide you your personal data in our possession, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable

information, you may modify, update or delete such information by sending us an email at support@wemod.com.\nYou should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify
