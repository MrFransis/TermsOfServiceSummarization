e-mail to anyone in this domain from other accounts in this domain or from over the Internet, it is our policy to take appropriate action to see that such solicitations are not sent though this system again.</p>\n<p>It is a violation of our terms of service to send unsolicited advertising and promotional material through our system, or to give a return address of this domain or system.</p>\n<p>It

be unlawful for any person within the United States to use any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine.\u201d A \u201ctelephone facsimile machine\u201d is defined in Sec.227(a)(2)(B) as: \u201cequipment which has the capacity to transcribe text or images (or both) from an electronic signal received over a regular telephone line onto paper.\u201d Under this definition, an e-mail account, modem, computer and printer together constitute a fax machine.</p>\n<p>Our company specifically does not authorize the use of its proprietary computers, servers, routers and computer network (the \u201cnetwork\u201d) to accept, transmit or distribute unsolicited bulk e-mail sent from the Internet to our members.\nIt is also a violation of policy, and the law, to send or cause to be sent to, or through, the network Internet email that makes use of or contains invalid or forged headers, invalid or non-existent domain names or other means of deceptive addressing.\nWe consider such email to be counterfeit, and any attempt to send or cause such counterfeit email to be sent to, or through, our network is unauthorized.\nMoreover, any email relayed from a third party\u2019s mail servers without the permission of that third party, or any email that hides or obscures, or attempts to hide or obscure, the source of an email also constitutes an unauthorized use of our network.\nEmail sent or caused to be sent to our network that violates our Terms of Service is also unauthorized.\nNor do we authorize the harvesting or collection of screen or account names from the our network for the purpose of sending unsolicited email.</p>\n<p>Our customers may send a single e-mail message to a maximum of 100 recipients in one mailing, not to exceed 500 recipients within a one hour period.\nAll single e-mails sent to over 100 addressees will not be delivered.\nNo notice will be given to you in this

available to prevent unsolicited bulk email or other unauthorized email from entering, utilizing or remaining within our network.\nSuch action may include, without limitation, the use of filters or other network devices, immediate termination of service, and prosecution of offenders through criminal or civil proceedings.\nNothing in this policy shall be construed to grant any right to transmit or send email to, or through, our network, and in no event shall any failure by us to enforce this policy constitute a waiver of our rights.</p>\n<p>Unauthorized use of our network in connection with the transmission of unsolicited bulk email, including the transmission of counterfeit email, may result in civil and criminal penalties against the sender, including those provided by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1030 et seq.).\nand various state laws, including the Virginia Computer Crimes Act (Va.\nCode Ann.\n\u00a7 18.2-152.2 et seq.) (amended effective July 1, 1999.)</p>\n<p>VIRTBIZ, in its sole discretion, may terminate service without warning for any customer who is found to send unsolicited commercial email.\nIn no case shall

Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) in addition to the United States of America \u201cCan Spam Act of 2003\u201d which states in part (b) \u201cISP HELD HARMLESS FOR GOOD FAITH PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT- An ISP is not liable, under any Federal or State civil or criminal law, for any action it takes in good faith to block the transmission or receipt of unsolicited commercial e-mail.\u201d</p>\nDATA

strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nVIRTBIZ may be able to offer support for customer backups, both on-site and off-site.&nbsp.\nDedicated hosting customers can contact their account representative for assistance and consultation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Colocation</strong>:&nbsp.\nDue to the nature of varied colocation use cases, no backup solution is provided for colocation users.&nbsp.\nIt is expected that the customer has a working competency with regard to data integrity and it is the customer responsibility to maintain a backup strategy.&nbsp.\nIRTBIZ may be able to offer support for customer backups, both on-site and off-site.&nbsp.\nColocation hosting customers can contact their account representative for assistance and consultation.</p>\nINDEMNIFICATION:\n<p>Upon our request, you agree to
