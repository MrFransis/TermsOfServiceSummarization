Platform .\nWebsites, mobile apps and publishers of other internet-connected digital media properties such as internet-connected TVs (each a \u201c<strong>Digital Property</strong>\u201d and collectively \u201c<strong>Digital Properties</strong>\u201d) use the Platform to sell ad space on those properties.\nAdvertisers or companies on the advertiser\u2019s behalf, use the Platform to purchase that ad space in the most efficient way possible.\nThe Platform also allows Digital Properties and advertisers to do other things, like measure the effectiveness of their ads, to help prevent malware or other bad activity, and similar functions designed to make the buying and selling of ad space seamless, efficient, and effective.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Information Xandr Collects</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you (an internet user) visit a Digital Property that has integrated our Platform or that uses technology that integrates with our Platform, we collect certain

Property, we assign a random unique identifier (an \u201cAppNexus ID\u201d, or \u201cXandr ID\u201d) to your browser or device, which allows the Platform to automatically recognize your browser or device the next time it visits another Digital Property that has integrated our technology.&nbsp.\nThis allows our clients and partners to sync their own unique identifiers against this ID so that they can use their own data on the Platform that they may have associated with you (collectively \u201cDigital Identifiers\u201d).</p>\n<p>The Platform uses cookies, beacons, pixels, tags, mobile SDKs, and similar technologies to collect this information.\nFor a detailed description of cookies and similar technologies set by the Platform, see&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>Xandr Digital Platform Cookie

Advertising</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Web Browsers</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>You can visit privacycenter.xandr.com to opt out of having the Platform used to select ads for your browser based on your online web browsing behavior.\nWhen you opt out, an opt out cookie (from adnxs.com) will be stored in your web browser.\nThe Platform will know the choice you have made when it sees your opt out cookie, and will apply your choice to all companies using the Platform.\nIf you block or delete the opt out cookie, you will not be opted out and will need to allow cookies from Xandr and renew your opt out choice.</p>\n<p>To review your opt in status or learn more about interest-based advertising, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;opt out page, the DAA\u2019s&nbsp;WebChoice tool&nbsp;or the DAAC\u2019s&nbsp;WebChoices tool.</p>\n<p>Important things to note about the web browser opt out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Blocked cookies</u>\n</strong>: The opt out cookie may not work if your browser is configured to block third-party cookies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Deleting or protecting opt outs</u>\n</strong>: If you delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again.\nThere are browser plugins to help you preserve your opt out cookies.\nFor more information, please visit&nbsp;http://www.aboutads.info/PMC.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Only this browser</u>\n</strong>: The opt out only applies to the browser profile in which you set it.\nFor example, if you set the opt out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt out will not be active in Chrome.\nTo opt out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt out process.\nThis is because the cookies cannot be read between different browsers or browser profiles.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>The opt out does not block or delete cookies</u>\n</strong>: It also does not prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior.\nIf you opt out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising.\nAds may be selected, for example, based on the content of the web page in which they are shown.\nIf you wish to block or delete cookies altogether, you can use web browser settings to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Mobile Apps</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Mobile device system software such as Apple iOS or Google Play Services provide mechanisms that allow users to opt out of the use of information about their usage of mobile apps to deliver targeted ads to their mobile device.\nFor more information, or to opt out using these mechanisms, consult your device settings (\u201cOpt out of Personalized Ads\u201d on Android devices and \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d on iOS devices).\nWhen Xandr\u2019s technology encounters \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d signals they are respected.\nDevices vary in where they include the setting to adjust, you can use the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s mobile optout guide&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Location Data</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Most mobile devices offer you the ability to stop the collection of location information at any time by changing the preferences on your device.&nbsp.\nYou may also be able to stop the collection of location information by particular apps by adjusting the settings for individual apps or following the standard uninstall process to remove specific mobile apps from your device.&nbsp.\nNote when location services have not been enabled in any of your apps, we will still infer data about your location based on your IP address.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Televisions</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Your internet connected device (e.g.\na smart TV or a set- top box) may give you the ability to opt-out of the use of information for advertising purposes.&nbsp.\nTo determine if your Internet connected device has these options, please visit your device\u2019s settings menu.\nXandr reads and applies industry opt out signals for connected televisions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access Rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you reside in certain jurisdictions, you may have the right to access the data we hold about your devices.\nIf you are interested in exercising any of these rights, please click&nbsp;here.\nNote that because we do not collect information that directly identifies an individual (and prohibit clients from storing this information) on the Platform, it is generally not feasible for us to verify individuals\u2019 identities to provide information that is tied to their identities, so we facilitate access rights on a browser or device level basis.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Deletion Rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you reside in certain jurisdictions, you may have the right to delete the data we hold about your devices.\nIf you are interested in exercising any of these rights, please click&nbsp;here.\nNote that you can delete your cookies at any time by using your browser settings.\nYou can also reset the advertising identifier in your mobile device at any time by using your platform setting referenced in Mobile Apps above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Industry Self-Regulation</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Xandr supports industry self-regulation, and endorses best practices and self-regulatory requirements that apply to the Platform.\nXandr/AppNexus is a member in good standing of the Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d) and adheres to the NAI Code of Conduct.\nXandr/AppNexus also follows the industry self-regulatory guidelines of the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) and the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (\u201cDAAC\u201d).\nThe following links are lists of the Xandr-provided

countries (including in Singapore, Japan, Australia and Brazil where our global affiliates have offices) and by those third parties with whom we may share your information.</p>\n<p>These countries
