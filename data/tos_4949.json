information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person.\nThis includes, for example, information such as your name, age, address, phone number, date of birth, e-mail address, IP address, or user behavior.\nInformation that we can not relate to your person (or only with disproportionate effort), e.g.\nby anonymizing the information, are not personal information.\nThe processing of personal data (eg.\ncollecting, querying, using, storing or transmitting) always requires a legal basis or your consent.\nProcessed personal data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing has been achieved and no legally required retention requirements have to be maintained.</p>\n<p>If we process your personal data for the purpose of providing certain offers, we will subsequently inform you of the specific transactions, the scope and purpose of the data processing, the legal basis for the processing and the respective retention period.</p>Use of our websites<p>When using our websites, we may create web server logs that contain the date and time, the retrieved URL path, the referrer (if applicable) and the browser used.\nHowever, we anonymise your IP address using IP masking, so that we do not collect any personal data.</p>Use of our hosting service<p>When registering you choose yourself a suitable username (pseudonym).\nWe use your e-mail address exclusively for the immediate purpose of the contract (password recovery, charging reminder, receipt of payment, abuse notifications, contract amendments, notifications due to legal regulations).</p>\n<p>If you have previously registered domains through us (which we no longer offer), your personal data will be processed either by InterNetX GmbH, Johanna-Dachs-Str.\n55, 93055 Regensburg or by http.net Internet GmbH, Franzstr.\n51, 52064 Aachen.\nWe have carefully selected all the domain registrars that we use to provide domain registrations, also based on their privacy policies, and have signed a data processing agreement with all vendors.\nOur data protection officer has checked both the data processing agreements as well as the technical and organizational measures before the conclusion of the contracts.\nAccording to our instructions, your data will only be used for the technical processing of your domain registration.</p>Payments<p>Our hosting service is paid through a prepaid account that you can charge by bank transfer or cash by post.</p>\n<p>When charging prepaid account via bank transfer, we will know your name and bank details through our bank.\nHowever, we process this information completely separate from our account database, to which we only provide the date, the username extracted from the purpose, the amount and the country code derived from the IBAN code, but neither your name nor your bank account.</p>\n<p>In the case of bank transfers that we can not match with a hosting account (eg if the purpose does not mention a username or a wrong one), we will also submit the last four digits of your IBAN and your name, abbreviated to two letters for each part of the name, to allow you to assign them manually.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you have the option of charging your prepaid account with cash by mail.\nIn this case, we will not receive any personal data beyond the country code of the postmark.</p>\n<p>The country code alone does not represent personal data, since the country itself can not be traced back to a specific person.\nHowever, we need to store the country in our systems to determine the applicable VAT rate for proper invoicing.</p>\n<p>In the process of creating a receipt you can personalize them with your billing address.\nThe specification of a billing address is not required by our side.\nPlease note that we have to keep invoices according to the legally prescribed period (10 years according to \u00a7 14b Value Added Tax Act).\nIf you provide a billing address, it is subject to the retention obligation.</p>Disclosure of data<p>Regarding our hosting service, we do not share personal information with third parties.\nExceptions to this rule are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have expressed consent in accordance with Art.\n6 para.\n1 sentence 1 lit.\na GDPR</li>\n<li>The transfer is permitted by law and according to Art.\n6 para.\n1 p.\n1 lit.\nb GDPR required to fulfill the contractual relationship with you</li>\n<li>There is a legal obligation for disclosure pursuant to Art.\n6 para.\n1 sentence 1 lit.\nc GDPR</li>\n<li>Sharing personal information is required according to Art.\n6 para.\n1 sentence 1 lit.\nf GDPR for the protection of legitimate corporate interests, as well as for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims required, and there is no reason to assume that you have a predominant legitimate interest in the non-disclosure of your data</li>\n</ul>External data processing<p>The data you upload to your Uberspace will only be processed by us.</p>\n<p>However, if you consult our support team, we make use of external companies that will process your data for us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To process support requests made via contact form, e-mail or Twitter we use a support platform of Zammad GmbH, Marienstra\u00dfe 11, 10117 Berlin, which gains knowledge of your personal data in so far as these result from your request.</li>\n<li>If you leave us a message on our telephone number, then sipgate GmbH, Gladbacher Stra\u00dfe 74, 40219 D\u00fcsseldorf will automatically transcribe it and send the transcript as well as the voice recording to us by e-mail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have carefully selected all companies backing our support efforts, also based on their privacy policies, and have signed a data processing agreement with all vendors.\nOur data protection officer has checked both the data processing agreements as well as the technical and organizational measures before the conclusion of the contracts.\nAccording to our instructions, your data will only be used for the technical processing of your support requests.</p>Use of cookies<p>We do not use any cookies on the public parts of our websites.</p>\n<p>When you register or log in, we set a cookie that carries a session ID.\nThis is technically mandatory to maintain your login status, and therefore requires no separate consent.\nThe cookie is not stored persistently, but is automatically deleted when the browser window is closed.</p>Tracking and analysis tools<p>We do not use any external tracking and analysis tools.</p>\n<p>On some of our websites we use Umami, an open source software for statistical analysis of accesses by visitors.\nIn this process, the data is processed and stored exclusively by ourselves.\nUmami does not collect personally identifiable information and anonymizes all data collected.\nUsers cannot be identified and are never tracked across websites.</p>Social network plugins<p>We do not use any plugins of social networks.</p>Links<p>You may occasionally find links to other websites on our website.\nBy activating these links you will be redirected to the website of another operator, which you can recognize by the changed URL in the browser.\nWe have no control over their content and therefore do not have any responsibility for how those other websites handle your personal information.\nWe have not checked if the operators of those websites comply with the GDPR.\nPlease inform yourself about it.\n(Hopefully that\u2019s obvious, because that\u2019s how the Internet works, but our lawyers thought we should write it down.)</p>Data subject rights<p>As a person affected by the processing of personal data you have the following rights under GDPR, and we are obliged to point this out to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pursuant to Art.\n15 GDPR, you may request information about your personal data processed by us.\nIn particular, you may request information about the

personal data if the accuracy of the data is disputed by you, the processing is unlawful, we no longer require the data and you refuse its deletion because you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.\nYou may also exercise the right under Art.\n18 GDPR if you have objected to the processing.\n(Art.\n21 GDPR)</li>\n<li>Pursuant to Art.\n20 GDPR, you can request to receive your

data on grounds that arise from your particular situation.\nAlternatively, if the objection is directed against direct marketing, you have a general right of objection, which is followed by us without you having to state a particular reason.</p>Data security and security measures<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and keeping your personal information confidential.\nIn order to avoid manipulation, loss or misuse of your data stored by us, we take extensive technical and organizational security precautions, which are regularly checked and adapted to technological progress.\nThis includes, among other things, the use of recognized encryption procedures.\nHowever, we would like to point out that, due to the nature of the Internet, it is possible that the rules of data protection and the above-mentioned security measures may not be followed by other persons or institutions outside our area of responsibility.\nIn particular, unencrypted data can be read by third parties - e.g.\nif sent via e-mail.\nWe have no technical influence on this.\nIt is your responsibility to protect the data provided by you against misuse, e.\ng.\nby utilizing encryption technology.</p>", "created_at": "2021-09-02 01:09:15.399236", "updated_at": "2021-09-01 23:09:43.698876"}], "points": [], "urls": ["uberspace.de"]}}
