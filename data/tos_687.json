personal information\nmay be processed outside of the European Union, in countries such as the\nUnited States of America, Australia, India, that are subject to\ndifferent standards of data protection.</p>\n<p>We will take appropriate steps to ensure that transfers of personal information\nare in accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to protect your\nprivacy rights and interests and transfers are limited to countries which\nare recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where\nwe can be satisfied that alternative arrangement are in place to protect\nyour privacy rights.\nTo this end:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>where we transfer your personal information outside of Fastmail or to third parties who help provide our services, we obtain contractual commitments from those third parties to protect your personal information.\nSome of these assurances are well-recognised certification schemes like the EU US Privacy Shield for the protection of personal information transferred from within the EU to the United States and/or the use of EU approached Standard Contractual Clauses (<strong>\u201cEU Model Clauses\u201d</strong>) for controller to controller and /or controller to processor transfers from the EU/UK to jurisdictions, such as Australia who do not have an adequacy finding from the EU Commission.\nor</li>\n<li>where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any personal information is disclosed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You have a right to contact us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal information when this is transferred as mentioned above.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nHow we protect and store your information\nSecurity\n<p>We store most of your personal information electronically.\nWe implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, misuse or interference or the unauthorised disclosure, access or modification to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned.</p>\n<p>The security of your information is paramount and a critical consideration for Fastmail in the provision of its services to you.\nPlease see further information on the security measures we engage on our websites and platform and when you use any of our services.</p>\n<p>We work hard to protect you and Fastmail from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold.\nMeasures we take include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>placing confidentiality requirements and restricted access protocols on our staff members and service providers who need access to your information in order to process it to provide our services to you;</li>\n<li>destroying your personal information if it is no longer needed to provide you with our service;</li>\n<li>destroying logging or other transactional information that may incidentally contain personal information in accordance with our schedules to clear such information;</li>\n<li>following strict security procedures in the access, storage and disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorised access to it.\nand</li>\n<li>using secure communication transmission software (known as \"secure sockets layer\" or \"SSL\") that encrypts all information you input on our website before it is sent to us.\nSSL is an industry standard encryption protocol and this ensure that the information is reasonably protected against unauthorised interception.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the security of information depends in part on the security of

periods\nof time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal,\nregulatory, tax, accounting requirements.\nWhere we log information related to\nyour IP address, we retain this information for approximately 90 days.\nThis is for the purposes of fraud watch, as often users don\u2019t check in with us in a timely fashion over whether their account is compromised.\nBeing able to look at some amount of recent history and know what activity was taken by a legitimate user vs a malicious one is useful.</p>\n<p>We proscribe your primary email address, if it\u2019s at one of our domains, for up\nto 6 six months after your account is closed, to reduce the risk of\nimpersonation, should someone try to use the same email address as you in order\nto impersonate you.</p>\n<p>Where you request that we delete your account from our system, we will\nimmediately lock the account and archive the information, then delete it from\nour severs within approximately 7 days from the date of your request.\nThis\narchive window allows you to recover your information in the event of an\naccident or malicious deletion request.</p>\n<p>However, in specific limited circumstances we may store your personal\ninformation for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of\nyour dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we\nreasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal\ninformation or dealings.</p>\nChildren's data\n<p>When a Fastmail product collects age, and there is an age in your jurisdiction under which parental

Powerful features Privacy and security Our values Great for business Our company Pricing News Get Support Log in Sign up Using two-step verification (2FA) <p>Two-step verification increases the security of your account by requiring two steps - your password plus an additional security step - in order to log in to your account.\nWe support two-step verification with either an app on your phone, a dedicated security device that plugs into your computer, or a code sent by SMS.</p>\n<p>You might have heard of two-step verification being called \"two-factor authentication\" or \"2FA\".</p>\n<p>It is not required to be set up on your account, but it is recommended if you want additional security.</p> Why should I use two-step verification? <p>In an ideal world, all passwords would be a secret.\nBut the more a password is used, the more exposed it becomes to malicious attackers.\nThey might try to steal it (through phishing or malware/spyware), or guess it (through brute force repeated dictionary attacks).</p>\n<p>With two-step verification, if someone does manage to steal your password, they still can't use it to log in to your account without your verification device.</p> How to set up two-step verification General Setup Instructions <ol>\n<li>Open the Settings \u2192 Password &amp.\nSecurity screen.</li>\n<li>If this is your first time enabling two-step verification for this account, you must add a recovery phone to your account (see \"Account Recovery Credentials\" below).</li>\n<li>If you have a recovery phone on your account, go to the Two-Step Verification section and click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Set Up Two-Step Verification</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select which kind of verification device you're adding to your account.\nSkip to the \"Authenticator App\" or \"U2F or YubiKey OTP\" instructions below for instructions on adding your verification device.</li>\n</ol> Account Recovery Credentials <p>To help make sure that you are not locked out of your own account, before you can enable two-step verification, you must add a recovery phone to your account.\nIf you ever lose access to your primary form of two-step verification, your recovery phone can be used to prevent you from being locked out of your account.\nYou get a code sent to your phone instead to complete your second step when you log in.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the Settings \u2192 Password &amp.\nSecurity screen, go to the Account Recovery section and click <strong>Add</strong>.\nEnter your password in the yellow box and click <strong>Unlock</strong> to allow changes on this page.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>Add Recovery Phone</strong> to add a recovery phone number to your account.</li>\n<li>Enter your phone number and click <strong>Send Verification Code</strong>.\nClicking this button will send a verification code to your recovery phone.</li>\n<li>Once you've received your verification code, enter the code and click <strong>Verify</strong>.\nThis will add your recovery phone to your account.</li>\n<li>A confirmation screen will appear.\nClick <strong>Done</strong> to return to the Password &amp.\nSecurity screen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On the Account Recovery screen, you can also see your recovery code, which is randomly generated for your account.\nIf you forget your password or lose your security device, you can use the recovery code as part of the recovery process to reset your password and restore access to your account.\nWe <strong>strongly recommend</strong> writing down or printing out your recovery code and keeping it somewhere safe.</p> Authenticator app <ol>\n<li>Once you've installed the authenticator app on your phone or tablet, select to <strong>add a new

page, then:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enter your username and your password.\nClick <strong>Log In</strong>.</li>\n<li>Enter the current <strong>verification code</strong> from your authenticator app or OTP device, or plug in your security key and touch the button if it has one.\nIf you have more than one two-step method on your account, you can switch method using the links under the login box.</li>\n<li>You can also declare this computer as trusted which means you don't need to use two-step verification again when logging in on that computer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you're using an authenticator app on a phone or through the website, and you use 1Password to manage your passwords, we have detailed instructions on using them together.\n(Fastmail iOS/Android apps, Fastmail web client).</p>\n<p>If you'd like to revoke a computer's trusted status, you can also do that on the Password &amp.\nSecurity screen: the next time you log in on that device, you will need to re-authenticate using your 2FA.</p> How to set up a client when using two-step verification <p>Mail and calendaring computer programs and phone/tablet apps don't support two-step verification, other than the Fastmail apps.</p>\n<p>You'll need to set up app passwords for each device instead.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Why do I have to add a recovery phone number to set up two-step verification? <p>Keeping your account safe from attackers is very important, but so is making sure you don't get locked out of your own account.\nRequiring a phone as a backup option balances security (no one else can read your data) and availability (you can read your data).\nFor most users, the risk of losing their two-step verification device is far greater than the risk of someone hacking their SMS.\nIf you lose your phone, the TOTP key is lost, but normally you can get a new SIM card with the same number from your carrier.</p>\n<p>Please note, if two-step verification is enabled, access to the phone number itself is not sufficient to gain access to an account: you still need two factors (your password AND the SMS).</p>\n<p>Users who accept the risk of being locked out of their account may remove the recovery phone number from their account after two-step verification has been enabled.\n<strong>Once the phone number is removed from the account, SMS is no longer an option as the second factor for verification.</strong> If you choose to do this, we <strong>strongly recommend</strong> you write down or print your recovery code and store it in a safe location, and that you set up at least two security keys or authenticator devices.\nShould you lose access to all two-step verification devices and not have your recovery code, <strong>you may be permanently locked out of your own account.</strong>\n</p> Which one is right for me? <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Authenticator app</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>An app is installed on your phone and randomly generates codes for you.</li>\n<li>The code

or security device.</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can have more than one two-step verification device on your account.</p> Authenticator apps <p>Not sure which authenticator app to use? We recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone: Google Authenticator, Authy or Duo Mobile</li>\n<li>Android: Google Authenticator, Authy or Duo Mobile</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a different phone, you may still be able to use TOTP.\nAny app supporting Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) from the Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH) as specified in RFC 6238 should work.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note</strong>: Neither the Google Authenticator app nor our server implementation is specific to Google in any way, nor does it ever communicate with Google systems as part of its operation (or with any other system).\n\"Google Authenticator\" is the name of Google's TOTP app, which has become synonymous with the authentication method itself.</p> U2F and YubiKey OTP security keys <p>We have tested with a variety of different security keys, and any key that supports U2F should work.\nWe do recommend YubiKey, as in our experience these have the best build quality, a slim profile, and are reliable.\nYou can buy one from the Yubico store or via Amazon.</p> OTP devices <p>Many manufacturers are now selling standalone OTP devices, often in a credit card or key fob form-factor.\nWe've tested with Feitian c200 devices, but any device implementing the TOTP standard should work.\nWe support devices with HEX or BASE32-encoded keys with a 30- or 60-second time step.\nIf your particular device doesn't work, please let us know the make and model of the device and we'll look into adding support for it.</p>\n<p>When adding these devices to your account, use the <strong>\"Authenticator App\"</strong> option.\nThis is because OTP devices use the same mechanism (TOTP) as authenticator apps described above.</p> How do authenticator apps and security keys work? <p>Interested in what's happening under the hood to keep you safe? Learn more about how TOTP works, how U2F works, or how YubiKey OTP works.</p> Fastmail security principles <p>We take security seriously at Fastmail and design our systems to improve the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our customers' data.\nThe user login process and account recovery process are a particularly important part of our security.\n</p>\n<p>When you turn on two-step verification, we understand that you value the confidentiality of your account more highly and take extra steps to ensure that.\nIf you lose access to your account when you have two-step verification enabled, the recovery process still requires two independent factors.\nIf a recovery attempt is successful, we delay the final recovery step for 24 hours.\nIn this time, we notify the account owner via email and give them the opportunity to cancel the recovery if they weren't the person who requested it.\n</p>\n<p>For more information on how we designed our security system, see our blog post about the design and thought process.</p> Help &amp.\nSupport Security <b>Two-step verification</b> Fastmail Why Fastmail <ul>\n<li>Powerful features</li>\n<li>Privacy and security</li>\n<li>Our values</li>\n<li>Great for business</li>\n<li>Pricing</li>\n</ul> Company <ul>\n<li>About us</li>\n<li>Media</li>\n<li>News</li>\n<li>Jobs</li>\n</ul> Get Support <ul>\n<li>Help center</li>\n<li>Contact us</li>\n<li>System status</li>\n<li>Download the app</li>\n<li>Referral program</li>\n<li>Report a security issue</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Download the app on the App Store </li>\n<li>Download the app on Google Play </li>\n</ul> Privacy policy Terms of service Facebook Twitter Linkedin ", "created_at": "2020-06-23 07:47:29.636256", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 23:56:16.538668"}, {"id": 2632, "name": "Help and Support", "url": "https://www.fastmail.com/help/", "xpath": "", "text": " Fastmail Email on your side Why Fastmail?

Powerful features Privacy and security Our values Great for business Our company Pricing News Get Support Log in Sign up How Fastmail provides a secure service <p>We have a great responsibility at Fastmail to keep your email secure.\nWe continually review our code and processes for potential vulnerabilities and we take new measures wherever possible to further secure your data.\nOn this page we list some of the core things we do to maintain security.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer data</li>\n<li>Secure access to mail</li>\n<li>Encrypted sending/receiving</li>\n<li>Content security policy</li>\n<li>Necessary communications</li>\n<li>Software updates</li>\n<li>Software system security</li>\n<li>Image loading privacy</li>\n<li>Bug bounty</li>\n<li>Physical location

data</li>\n<li>Limitations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Customer data <p>We know that email is free-form, and could contain all kinds of information about our customers and other people they correspond with, including data of the most confidential sort.\nDue to the nature of our business (hosting and forwarding free-form emails), our systems process large amounts of potentially highly confidential data.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we treat all personal data belonging to our customers as Customer Confidential (<strong>\u201cyour data</strong>\u201d), which is the highest level of protection within our data modeling.</p>\n<p>To provide the services we offer, it is necessary for our computer systems to process unencrypted and unobfuscated data (for example: to build the search indexes which allow fast message retrieval, or to push alarm notifications for calendar events).</p>\n<p>\n</p> Secure access to mail <p>We mandate all connections to our servers use Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, for all connections including webmail, the Fastmail official app, and IMAP/POP/SMTP email client access.\nThis prevents eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery on any communication between your computer or phone and our servers.</p>\n<p>We have full support for Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) with our encrypted connections, which ensures that even if we were somehow compromised in the future, no previous communication could be decrypted.\nAll connections in supporting browsers have been protected by PFS since July 2012.</p>\n<p>A Strict Transport Security header is sent with all of our webpages.\nThis tells all modern browsers to <strong>only</strong> connect to us over an encrypted connection, even if you have a bookmark, click a link or type a URL to an insecure page at our site.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Encrypted sending/receiving <p>Whenever you send a message to someone outside of Fastmail we have to send it across the open internet.\nSince January 2010 we have fully encrypted all connections between us and the receiving server whenever the other server supports it, preventing passive eavesdropping, tampering or forgery.\nSimilarly, we have accepted encrypted connections for mail delivery <strong>\n<em>to</em>\n</strong> our servers since April 2009, and we encourage all servers connecting to us to use it.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Content security policy <p>Within our web interface we set a Content Security Policy header, which ensures that only scripts we've written can be run.\nThis means that a potentially-malicious email that somehow managed to slip through our filters would still not be able to do anything dangerous.</p>\n<p>We use isolated domains to separate out untrusted content from the pages we generate.\nFor example, when you open an attachment, it opens at <code>fastmailusercontent.com</code> rather than <code>fastmail.com</code>.\nThanks to browser cross-origin security restrictions, this means that a rogue attachment can never access any of your data.</p>\n<p>Similarly, user websites are hosted on subdomains of <code>user.fm</code>, keeping them isolated from our site as well.</p>\n<p>\n</p> We only allow necessary communications <p>Many unexpected forms of attack come from failing to close potential vulnerabilities, including database port access, SSH port access, and so forth.\nWe use kernel-level firewalling to only allow connections to the services provided by each machine.</p>\n<p>\n</p> We keep track of software updates <p>Software contains bugs.\nWe track the software we use and any security vulnerabilities, and upgrade as soon as an issue is reported.</p>\n<p>\n</p> We use software systems that take security seriously <p>We use Debian and Joyent SmartOS as our operating systems, because they both take their security responsibilities and updates seriously.\nIn most cases, an update for a security problem will be available within hours of the original report.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Privacy: Image loading <p>When accessing your email through our web interface, we protect your privacy by fetching all referenced images through our servers.\nThis prevents the owner of the image from being sent additional information about you such as your internet address (which reveals your rough location), browser information and sometimes even tracking cookies.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Bug bounty <p>We run a tight ship, but we're only human and humans can make mistakes.\nThat's why we run a bug bounty program to encourage responsible disclosure of security issues and to reward security researchers who take the time to help us keep Fastmail safe.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Physical location security <p>Our main servers are located at New York Internet (NYI) in Bridgewater, New Jersey, USA.\nTheir facility is a high security, video monitored location.\nwith backup power, air conditioning, fire systems, 24x7x365 monitoring, and onsite technical support.\nAs their website notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Data Center security is a top priority for NYI.\nWe have taken extreme care to install the utmost security so that our customers know that their data is safe.\nOur Data Centers are located at heavily protected buildings where the security personnel are on guard 24x7.\nOther security features include biometric fingerprint readers on door locks, strategically placed cameras and motion detection, [and] doors equipped with alarm systems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>NYI does a whole lot more to ensure security, including their hardware, best-practices, and routines.\nYou can read all about them on their homepage.</p>\n<p>Our secondary sites at NYI's Seattle location has equivalent physical security.</p>\n<p>We use \u201cremote hands\u201d staff from the datacentres to perform routine maintenance on our servers (e.g.\nreplacing hard disks or installing new machines), however they do not have logins or the ability to access your data.</p>\n<p>Our datacentre vendors provide us with power, cooling and network links (public internet) but do not manage or have permitted access to our internal network between servers.\nAll public internet facing machines have a firewall.</p>\n<p>All data transfer between our datacentres is over an encrypted VPN (virtual private network) managed by us.</p>\n<p>\n</p> On-disk encryption <p>All your data is stored on encrypted disk volumes, including backups.\nWe believe this level of protection strikes the correct balance between confidentiality and availability.</p>\n<p>At this stage, some system log data (which could contain personal information) is temporarily stored on un-encrypted disks on individual servers, however we have an ongoing project to bring encryption to all system logging as well.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Staff access to your data <p>We limit staff access to customer data as stringently as their roles allow.</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of their jobs, it is necessary for our operations staff to have access to the systems where customer data is processed.\nThe staff who do require access to production servers for their jobs are aware of their responsibility to protect the confidentiality of your data, and only access that data where it\u2019s required either to provide customer support or for operational necessity.</p>\n<p>Where possible, our systems are designed to allow our support and operational staff to perform their duties without being exposed to your data.\nWhere possible, obfuscated data is presented (like to debug display problems).\nWhere possible, your explicit consent is sought if viewing unobfuscated data is necessary.</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of their jobs, it may be necessary for our security and fraud staff to have access to deobfuscated customer data or other personal information.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we anonymize your information, for example creating a testcase that reproduces a bug found with your data, by making a case which will trigger the same bug without containing any confidential or personally identifying information.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Password encryption <p>Where you are using a password to access our systems, we store that password in a non-reversible encryption scheme using current best practices.</p>\n<p>Where we are storing a password used to access other systems on your behalf (for example, POP links and calendar links) the password is stored with reversible encryption using a key which is stored separately from the encrypted data.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Transfer of confidential data with third parties <p>Fastmail\u2019s value proposition is \u201cservice in exchange for money\u201d.\nWe don\u2019t ever sell or monetize confidential data or even \u201caggregate customer data\u201d.</p>\n<p>As part of our commitment to open source, we do sometimes share statistical data (for example the average size of emails, or the percentage of email traffic which is encrypted or in written particular languages) which is useful in the broader email community to help drive software design.</p>\n<p>We also share spam reports and spam intelligence with our partner organisations who provide us with spam feeds.</p>\n<p>We use third party hosted services for bug tracking, support, exception alerting and communications.\nWhile we don\u2019t send bulk data through any of these services, small pieces of your data may wind up in core dumps, in support ticket updates, inside bug descriptions (we obfuscate where possible, but sometimes the raw data is needed) or in chat messages where colleagues share snapshots of what they\u2019re looking at.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Destruction of data <p>Some of the features of our products are designed specifically around <strong>not</strong> losing data, so while you want us to retain your data, it is replicated to multiple systems and backed up.</p>\n<p>When you request destruction of your data by deleting specific items, or closing your account, the data is removed in a time-delayed manner.\nThis both allows you to change your mind (undo, or restore from backup), and allows for the possibility that if your account is compromised and the attacker tries to delete everything, we can recover the data.</p>\n<p>We also collect some data which is personally identifiable as a side effect of the system monitoring and logging which we require for our operational stability.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Destruction of system logs</strong>\n</p>\n<p>System logs are retained for 180 days before being deleted.\nWe have a legitimate interest in having those logs available both to ensure the reliable operation of our systems, and to provide evidence of activity when users report unexpected states in their account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Destruction of deleted emails, contacts, and calendars</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Emails, contacts, calendars, and other personal data including notes that have been deleted in Fastmail or Pobox Mailstore are kept in backups for between 7 and 14 days after deletion.\n(They are wiped on Sunday the week after deletion.)</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Destruction of backup and search index data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The backup copies of email and search indexes are pruned on an \u201cas-needed\u201d basis based on the ratio of space that would saved by re-compacting them.\nAt the moment there is no guarantee that a particular message will be purged on a timeline, however our support can perform an immediate prune for a particular account on request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Destruction of data after account closure</strong>\n</p>\n<p>After an account is terminated, data and backups are purged within a timeframe of between 37 days to 1 year after closure depending on how long the account was active for, and whether the account was explicitly closed or lapsed due to lack of payment.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Limitations <p>While communication between your computer and our servers is encrypted, any email that you send to another server <em>may</em> have to pass over the internet in an unencrypted form (although we encrypt it wherever possible).</p>\n<p>The <em>only</em> way to ensure end-to-end security with email is to use email encryption software such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) or Secure/Multipurpose Internet mail Extensions (S/MIME).\nBoth of these systems require the creation of certificates, run on your computer, and are attached to your email client to encrypt/decrypt messages.</p>\n<p>Providing secure end-to-end encryption via webmail is impossible.\nThere are basically two options, both flawed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Keep a private key on the server and encrypt email on the server</p>\n<p>Although all traffic between the server and client may be encrypted via TLS, and then the email itself is encrypted on the server before being sent to the world, the unencrypted email is still available on the server between the TLS and encryption stages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use Java or JavaScript to encrypt email in the browser</p>\n<p>Because the script has to run on the user's browser, you could look at the code to see it's secure.\nIn reality, no one would ever do that.\nIn addition, this method can't prevent someone using malicious scripts to send encrypted messages back to the server, as well as the encryption key, for the server to decrypt.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Famously, Hushmail, which allows you to use both of these options, admitted that the U.S.\ngovernment compelled them to turn over the unencrypted emails of a number of users.</p>\n<p>Their contention on how secure they are then relates to what it requires to get a court order.\nIn a Wired article, Hushmail stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All Hushmail users agree to our terms of service, which state that Hushmail is not to be used for illegal activity.\nHowever, when using Hushmail, users can be assured that no access to data, including server logs, etc., will be granted without a specific court order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar requirement applies to Fastmail, as our Privacy Policy states.\nWe won't release any data without the required legal authorisation from an Australian court.\nAs an Australian company, we do not respond to US court orders.</p> Help &amp.\nSupport The Fastmail Service <b>Security</b> Fastmail Why Fastmail
