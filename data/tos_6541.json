following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Personal Information voluntarily provided by you if and when you contact us, which may include your name and email address, provided that such information will be used

identification number, which is a random number we generate to keep track of the data sets we collect and if required, enable us to execute your data rights requests as further detailed below.\nAlthough the unique ID does not reveal the identity of a user and is not generated based on any user personal information, it may be considered Personal Information in some jurisdictions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We make sure that the Extension Usage Data is cleaned and scrubbed on your device prior to being sent to our servers, for the purpose of removing and filtering any information that could be used to identify you and transferring solely Non-Personal Information to our servers.\nYou can opt-out of the collection of the Extension Usage Data by

or provided by you with our subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively \u201c<b>Affiliated Companies</b>\u201c) in the event of a corporate transaction (e.g.\nsale of a substantial part of our business, merger, consolidation or asset sale).\nIn the event of the above, our Affiliated Companies or acquiring company will assume the rights and
