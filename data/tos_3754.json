to the information we collect on the LiveRamp.com website.\nThe purpose of the notice is to ensure visitors to the LiveRamp.com website understand what data we collect, and why.\nMore information on privacy considerations regarding LiveRamp\u2019s services can be found here.</p>\n<p>If you are visiting this site from outside of the United States, where applicable we invite you to visit the website specific to your region, as that content may better fit LiveRamp\u2019s local offerings.\nThe privacy notice of those websites may also differ from the policy governing LiveRamp.com.\nPlease use the following links for visiting our Australian, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and UK sites.</p>\nLiveRamp overview\n<p>LiveRamp is a data connectivity platform.\nOur technology sits between consumers and brands that advertise online: our services ensure any data connected across the internet for the purpose of digital advertising prioritizes consumer privacy at all times.\nLike an armored car for data, we keep information safe and secure, allowing for companies and consumers alike to enjoy the benefits of more relevant online advertising while maintaining privacy and the trust our industry and the public has placed in us.\n</p>\n<p>Our service allows websites which rely on digital advertising to keep your experience free of charge and personalized, versus disrupting your browsing experience with ads irrelevant to your interests.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe information you provide to companies as you shop and interact online is used to provide you with free experiences across the internet, from the searches you perform to articles you read.\nExamples of these companies include social networks like Facebook and Twitter, online retailers, news websites, etc.\nMany of these companies are LiveRamp customers that use our platform as part of their data connectivity and privacy strategy.\nLiveRamp uses a number of techniques, including hashing and encryption, to protect the data which flows through our platform and ensure information using our products is not stored in a personally identifiable form in our system.</p>\nPurposes of the LiveRamp.com website\n<p>LiveRamp.com provides several broad services, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Education and communication about our products, services, recent company news, and general information about LiveRamp and its culture, as well as educational resources about the industry in which we operate.\nThis includes the opportunity for you to learn more about our offerings, such as by downloading white papers and e-books, signing up for our events, and reading the content on our marketing blog.\nIn some cases, you may choose to provide LiveRamp with personally identifiable information (PII) \u2013 for example, when registering for an event or joining our mailing list.\nLiveRamp\u2019s products are developed for use by businesses rather than consumers, and our website content generally assumes an audience familiar with our industry.\nHowever, we put people first when developing products to ensure any movement of data across the Internet for the purpose of digital advertising considers consumer privacy a priority at all times.\n</li>\n<li>Response to consumer comments or concerns, as well as receipt of Opt Out requests and data Subject Access Requests as provided for under US laws or regulations.</li>\n<li>Advertisement of career opportunities at LiveRamp, through our Careers page.</li>\n<li>Communication of information pertinent to LiveRamp investors, through our Investor Relations page.</li>\n</ul>\nWhat information LiveRamp.com collects\nInformation collected automatically\nCookies\n<p>Cookies are small, unique text files that a website sends to your computer (or another internet-connected device) to identify the device visiting the site.\nThe cookie is stored on your browser.\nCookies contain information that allows us to improve site functionality and security.</p>\n<p>We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete

cookies include information that allows LiveRamp to provide a more customized LiveRamp.com experience.\nThey may be used to tailor ad content on our site, on sites you may visit in the future, and to understand aggregate-level information such as traffic patterns to LiveRamp\u2019s website or engagement metrics, such as open rates, with email marketing campaigns.\nIf you choose to provide personally identifiable information in the course of your interaction with LiveRamp.com, or if you visit the website from a link in an email LiveRamp has sent you, your interactions with the website,

our services privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Additionally, emails we send to you may contain a bit of code known as a \u201cweb beacon.\u201d This code helps us understand the time and date that you have opened an email and when you have used a link within the email to visit a website, allowing us to collect analytics about our traffic, customize our services, and send you ads about our services.\nYou can disable our web beacons by turning images \u201coff\u201d in your email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express).\nPlease see your email client for more information.\nTo Opt Out of LiveRamp

you.</p>\n<p>Your browser may permit you to reject or delete cookies, but this may prevent proper working of our website.\nDifferent browsers handle cookies in different ways.\nFor instance, to

things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When was the cookie first seen? When was it last seen?</li>\n<li>What IP address is associated with the cookie? Based on the IP address, in which country is the device located?</li>\n<li>What is the type of browser the cookie is placed on?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As mentioned above, along with cookies and web beacons

information to gauge interest in LiveRamp from certain industries or certain firms at an aggregate (non-personally identifiable) level.</p>\nPersonally identifiable information (PII) you provide to us\n<p>PII includes information that directly identifies a specific, known individual \u2013 for example, your name, phone number, email, or postal address.\nWhen you interact with LiveRamp, you may identify yourself using PII \u2013 for example, when verifying your identity for a Subject Access Request under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) applicable to California residents, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applicable within the EU, and other nations with equivalent regulation, or other regulatory framework, emailing us with general questions about our business, or asking for more information on how LiveRamp\u2019s services can assist you.\nThe only PII collected on this website is what you choose to provide to us.</p>\n<p>PII collected for the purposes of Opting Out of LiveRamp or performing Subject Access Requests will only be used to honor those requests.\nLiveRamp may share or store this information with trusted service providers, solely contracted to assist in these requests.</p>\n<p>If you reach out to us at consumercare@liveramp.com, your email address and the content of your email will be accessible to our Consumer Care team.\nDepending on your comment or request, the Consumer Care team may also ask for the jurisdiction in which you reside to determine whether certain laws and regulations apply to your situation.\nIf necessary, the content of your email may be shared with additional individuals within LiveRamp in order to best answer your questions or concerns.\nVery rarely, your email address itself may be shared with the appropriate LiveRamp personnel if answering your request to LiveRamp depends on doing so.</p>\n<p>Where PII is provided in a commercial inquiry to LiveRamp, we may share that information with vendors with whom LiveRamp has contracted to assist with customer relationship management, marketing, and related uses.\nYou may Opt Out of any marketing communications you receive from us.\nin such cases, we may maintain your contact information in order to remain aware of, and honor, your previous Opt Out request.</p>\nHow LiveRamp shares information collected from LiveRamp.com\nSharing with service providers\n<p>We may use third party service providers for network, security, email, hosting, and other services.\nSuppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on our behalf, and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.</p>\nSharing for legal purposes\n<p>Under certain circumstances personal data may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.\nDisclosure may also occur when we believe in good faith that it is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request or to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.\nIf we are ever legally compelled to disclose your personal data to a third party, we will notify you with the contact information we have unless doing so would violate the law or a court order.</p>\nSharing with our insurance provider\n<p>We may disclose your personal data to our insurers and/or professional advisers insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes of obtaining or maintaining insurance coverage, managing risks, obtaining professional advice, or the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.</p>\nSharing in the event of a corporate/enterprise transition\n<p>If we ever go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal data and non-personal data will likely be among the assets transferred.\nYou will be notified in advance by email where possible, and we will post a prominent notice on our website.\nWe will require an acquiring company or merger agreement to uphold the material terms of this privacy statement, including honoring requests for account deletion.</p>\nSharing aggregate information, and sharing with partners\n<p>We may share with partners, prospects, clients, or our industry certain aggregate information which does not pertain to specific individuals (e.g., the number of attendees at our events).\nIn circumstances related to event marketing, with your explicit consent, we may share personally identifiable information such as your name, postal address, and email address with sponsorship partners.\nFor instance, if LiveRamp holds an event sponsored by one of our partners, our terms governing event attendance may allow us to share signup information with the sponsor.</p>\nOther important information\nChildren\u2019s privacy\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal data about children.\nOur websites and systems are not designed for use by individuals under the age of 18, and in particular are not designed for children under the age of 13.\nIf we learn we have collected or obtained personal data of someone under 13, we will delete that information from our database.\nIf you believe that this has occurred, please contact us at consumercare@liveramp.com.</p>\nSecurity\n<p>We take the security of our data and clients\u2019 information seriously.\nWe always take what we believe are reasonable precautions to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and to prevent data from being disclosed to unauthorized parties.\nWe, and service providers operating on our behalf who may use data collected on this site, follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\nHowever, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.\nTherefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>\nData transfers\n<p>Where business needs exist, LiveRamp intends to transfer, process, and/or store personal data outside the U.S.\nand EU.\nHowever, your personal data will not be transferred unless a valid transfer mechanism is in place legitimizing such a transfer.\nIn the case referred to in Article 46,47, or the second paragraph of Article 49(1), this will typically involve EU model clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.\nRead about the safeguards afforded by the EU model clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Update:</b> The European Court of Justice invalidated Privacy Shield on July 16, 2020 as a transfer mechanism between the EU and US companies.\nLiveRamp is utilizing EU model clauses, also known as standard contractual clauses, as our current method of transfer until new guidance becomes available, as recommended by the ICO and FDPIC \u2013 UK and Switzerland data protection authorities, respectively.</p>\nLinks to third-party sites\n<p>Our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of LiveRamp.\nIf you submit personal data to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies.\nWe encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>\nBlog and live chat\n<p>Our website offers publicly accessible blogs, which may be shared on certain social media entities including Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn using embedded functionality of those entities on LiveRamp.com.\nSocial media entities\u2019 collection and treatment of data, including the potential placement of 3rd-party cookies or the visibility of LiveRamp blog content you choose to share, is governed by those entities\u2019 respective privacy policies.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in our webinars or other events we may choose to offer live chat or question &amp.\nanswer features.\nYou should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.</p>\nChanges to this policy\n<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on November 9, 2020.\nWe will provide notice for 30 days whenever this Privacy Policy is changed in a material way.\nWe encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>\nOpt Out choices\n<p>LiveRamp distinguishes between data collected to facilitate its services, and data collected while visiting our website.\nOpt Out functionality for the former may be found here.\nGiven a lack of industry consensus and standardization, LiveRamp.com does not respond to browser \u2018Do Not

effectiveness of their TV/video campaigns.&nbsp.\nIn providing the Platform to our Customers, we may collect information from visitors to our Customers\u2019 websites and applications and recipients of our Customers\u2019 advertisements.\nWhen you visit a website or application, or view an advertisement, of one of our Customers through which we are collecting information, you are interacting with our Platform.&nbsp.\nThis Privacy Policy relates to information collected online by Data Plus Math Corporation (\u201cData Plus Math\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) from visitors to our Customers\u2019 websites and mobile applications and recipients of our Customers\u2019 advertisements (each a \u201cVisitor\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d) in order to provide the Platform to our Customers.\nData Plus Math also has a Website Privacy Policy that applies to information collected on the Data Plus Math website at www.dataplusmath.com and any subdomains.</p>\n<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms \u201cusing\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy serves to notify you of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What information about me is collected?</li>\n<li>Where and when is information collected (including through the use of cookies and action tags)?</li>\n<li>Does Data Plus Math collect information from children under 13 years of age?</li>\n<li>What does Data Plus Math do with the information it collects?</li>\n<li>How long does Data Plus Math retain the information it collects?</li>\n<li>When does Data Plus Math disclose information to third parties?</li>\n<li>Does this Privacy Policy apply when I link to other websites or services?</li>\n<li>Is the information collected through the Platform secure?</li>\n<li>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</li>\n<li>What choices do I have regarding the collection, disclosure and distribution of&nbsp.\ninformation?</li>\n<li>How will I know if there are any changes to this Privacy Policy?</li>\n<li>Who do I contact if I have any privacy questions?</li>\n</ul>\nWhat information about me is collected?\n<p>With respect to Visitors interacting with the Platform, we collect device-identifiable information only.\nWe also may receive device-identifiable and/or pseudonymous information about you from third parties.\nNevertheless, it is helpful to describe the differences between personally-identifiable information on the one hand and device-identifiable information on the other.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personally-Identifiable Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Personally identifiable information (PII) is information that identifies an individual or can be used to identify or contact an individual.\nSuch information may include a name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, financial account number, billing information, and government-issued identifier.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Device-Identifiable Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Device-Identifiable Information (DII) is any data that is linked to a particular browser or device if that data is not used, or intended to be used, to identify a particular individual.\nDII may include, but is not limited to, unique identifiers associated with browsers or devices, such as cookie identifiers or advertising identifiers, and IP addresses, where such data is not linked or intended to be linked to Personally-Identifiable Information (PII).\nDII includes data that is linked to a series of browsers or devices linked through Cross-Device Linking (the practice of linking two or more devices or browsers used or likely used by the same user), if that data is not used, or intended to be used, to identify a particular individual.</p>\nWhere and when is information collected (including through the use of cookies and action tags)?\n<p>We may receive Device-Identifiable Information about you through use of cookies, action tags and log files as part of your interaction with the Platform, provided that such interaction originates from an identifiable geography within the United States of America or one of its territories.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and action tags</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Through the Platform, we may collect Device-Identifiable Information passively using \u201ccookies\u201d and \u201caction tags,\u201d including when you interact with our Platform (such as by visiting the website or application, or viewing an advertisement, of one of our Customers).\n\u201cCookies\u201d are small text files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer as it interacts with the Platform and other websites.</p>\n<p>\u201cAction tags,\u201d also known as web beacons, pixel gifs or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed.\nAction tags are invisible to you.\nWhen you disable cookies, action tags still detect a unique website visit.</p>\n<p>By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to provide the Platform and other services to our Customers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising device identifiers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Through the Platform, we may collect Device-Identifiable Information passively using \u201cadvertising device identifiers,\u201d including when you interact with our Platform (such as by visiting the application, or viewing an advertisement, of one of our Customers on a device application).\n\u201cAdvertising device identifiers\u201d are unique identifiers generated by your device operating system for the purpose of providing a consistent device identifier for advertising purposes, also known as \u201cIdentifiers For Advertising (IDFA),\u201d \u201cGoogle AdID,\u201d or other such similar names.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Collection of information through your interaction with the Platform on other websites</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In providing services (including our Platform) to our Customers, we use cookies, action tags (including pixels), and scripts to

type, operating system, Internet provider, IP Address, domain name, pages visited on Customer websites or applications, actions take on Customer websites or applications or in response to Customer advertisements, and date and time of visits to Customer websites or applications or viewing of Customer advertisements.\nAdditionally, we combine the information we collect with other information we receive from third parties about Visitors to our Customers\u2019 websites and applications and Visitors who receive our Customers\u2019 advertisements, including by synchronizing behavioral information with the behavioral information of third parties via server to server cookie synchronizing technologies.\nWe also may use cross-device and cross-app technologies to establish deterministic or statistical connections among related devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers, SmartTVs, etc.</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, our cookies, action tags (including pixels), and scripts operate on third-party websites, applications, and advertisements.\nThis Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by us on the websites, applications, or advertisements of our Customers through the Platform.&nbsp.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected about you from third parties or third-party websites.\nIn addition, the placement of our cookies, actions tags (including pixels) on the websites, applications, or advertisements of our Customers does not imply that Data Plus Math endorses or has reviewed the websites, applications, or advertisements of our Customers.&nbsp.\nWe suggest contacting those websites, applications, services, entities or persons directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Log Files</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We also collect Device-Identifiable Information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving interaction with the Platform.\nThis information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Platform, to monitor interactions with the Platform, and to gather general demographic information.</p>\nDoes Data Plus Math collect information from children under 13 years of age?\n<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children.\nThe Platform is not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13.\nWe do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13.</p>\nWhat does Data Plus Math do with the information it collects?\n<p>In general, we use the information collected to provide the Platform and other services to our Customers, to help us understand who interacts with the Platform and for internal operations such as operating and improving the Platform.&nbsp.\nWe may also use the information gathered to perform statistical analysis of Visitor behavior in providing the Platform or to evaluate and improve the Platform.\nAs indicated above, we may also combine your information with other information we receive about you from third parties.</p>\nHow long does Data Plus Math retain the information it collects?\n<p>In general, we retain the information collected for a period of three (3) years, before it is aggregated for reporting purposes.\nSpecific Customer or Third-Party requirements, or applicable law, may reduce or extend this retention period.</p>\nWhen does Data Plus Math disclose information to third parties?\n<p>We generally disclose information we gather from you through the Platform to the following types of third parties and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically authorized by you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may share your information that we collect on a Customer\u2019s website, application, or advertisement with the applicable Customer, and such Customer\u2019s service providers, vendors, consultants, and other partners, as requested by such Customer.&nbsp.\nIn addition, we may share information that we collect about Visitors through the Platform with our Customers.\nAs noted above, we may combine your information with other information we receive about you from third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Laws and legal rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process.\nWe may disclose information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any contractual terms with Data Plus Math, to detect fraud, for assistance with a delinquent account, or to protect our rights or property or the safety or security of our users, the Platform or the general public.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third parties generally</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may provide to third parties information, including where such information is combined with similar information of others who use or interact with the Platform.\nFor example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users interact with the Platform or the demographic breakdown of those who interact with the Platform.&nbsp.\nThe third parties to which we may provide information may include providers of products or services (including analytics service providers, vendors, consultants and website tracking services), Customers and partners, vendors, or consultants of Customers (as described above), or partners, merchants, affiliates and other actual or potential commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers and other similar parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Outside contractors</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, \u201cOutside Contractors\u201d) to provide specific services and products related to the Platform, such as hosting and maintaining the Platform, providing fraud screening, and developing applications for the Platform.\nIn the course of providing products or services to us, these Outside Contractors may have access to information collected through the Platform.\nWe use reasonable efforts to ensure that these Outside Contractors are capable of protecting the privacy of your information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sale of Business</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or

as of: January 22, 2018</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy relates to information collected online by Data Plus Math Corporation (\u201cData Plus Math\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) through your use of the Data Plus Math website at www.dataplusmath.com and any subdomains (the \u201cSite\u201d).</p>\n<p>You should carefully read this Privacy Policy.\nBy using the Site, you are signifying your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, you may not use the Site.</p>\n<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms \u201cusing\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy serves to notify you of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What information about me is collected?</li>\n<li>Where and when is information collected (including through the use of cookies and action tags)?</li>\n<li>Does Data Plus Math collect information from children under 13 years of age?</li>\n<li>What does Data Plus Math do with the information it collects?</li>\n<li>When does Data Plus Math disclose information to third parties?</li>\n<li>Does this Privacy Policy apply when I link to other websites or services?</li>\n<li>Is the information collected through the Site secure?</li>\n<li>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</li>\n<li>What choices do I have regarding the collection, disclosure and distribution of personally identifiable information?</li>\n<li>Can I update or correct my personally identifiable information?</li>\n<li>How will I know if there are any changes to this Privacy Policy?</li>\n<li>Who do I contact if I have any privacy questions?</li>\n</ul>\nWhat information about me is collected?\n<p>Depending on your use of the Site, we may collect two types of information: personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Personally identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you.\nSuch information may include your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and billing and credit card information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, including demographic information (such as age, profession, gender, current location, zip code, birth date, or year of birth), IP addresses, browser types, unique device identifiers, device types, requested URL, referring URL, browser language, the pages you view, the date and time of your visit, domain names, and statistical data involving the use of the Site.\nCertain non-personally identifiable information may be considered a part of your personally identifiable information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.\nHowever, the same pieces of information are considered non-personally identifiable information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-personally identifiable information (for example, your viewing preferences).</p>\nWhere and when is information collected (including through the use of cookies and action tags)?\n<p>We will collect personally identifiable information that you submit to us.\nWe may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing credit and debit card authorization and fraud screening services as part of your use of the Site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Registering to Use the Site and in the Course of Using the Site.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may be required to establish an account in order to take advantage of certain features of the Site.\nIf so, if you wish to establish an account you will be required to provide us with information (including personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information) such as name, postal address, e-mail address, birth date and credit card and billing information.\nWe may also receive personally identifiable information about you from third parties providing credit and debit card authorization and fraud screening services as part of the registration process.\nIn addition, we may obtain your personally identifiable information from you if you identify yourself to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or comments.\nAlso, we will have access to any personally identifiable information that you choose to share through the Site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and Action Tags.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may collect non-personally identifiable information passively using \u201ccookies\u201d and \u201caction tags.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cCookies\u201d are small text files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Site and other websites.\nCookies can be used to personalize your experience on the Site (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you), to assist you in using the Site (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name each time you use the Site), to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Site to help us improve our offerings, and to determine the popularity of certain content.</p>\n<p>You do not have to accept cookies to use the Site.\nAlthough most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally.\nMost browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the \u201cHelp\u201d section of the toolbar.\nHowever, if you reject cookies, certain features or resources of the Site may not work properly or at all and you may experience some loss of convenience.</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this Site uses third-party service platforms (including to help analyze how users use the Site).&nbsp.\nThese third-party service platforms may place cookies on your computer or mobile device.\nIf you would like to disable \u201cthird party\u201d cookies, you may be able to turn them off by going to the third party\u2019s website.</p>\n<p>Here is a link to the main third-party platform we use: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</p>\n<p>\u201cAction tags,\u201d also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed.\nAction tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Site, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain action tags.</p>\n<p>By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve the Site and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p>Finally, you should be aware that third parties may use their own cookies or action tags when you click on a link to their websites or services on or from the Site.\nThis Privacy Policy does not govern the use of cookies or action tags or the use of your information by such third-party websites or services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Log Files.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We also collect non-personally identifiable information through our Internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of the Site.\nThis information may be used to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to monitor the use of the Site, and to gather general demographic information.\nWe may link this information to personally identifiable information for these and other purposes such as personalizing your experience on the Site and evaluating the Site in general.</p>\nDoes Data Plus Math collect information from children under 13 years of age?\n<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children.\nThe Site is not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13.\nWe do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13.</p>\nWhat does Data Plus Math do with the information it collects?\n<p>In general, we use the information collected to provide the Site to you and process your transactions, to help us understand who uses the Site, for internal operations such as operating and improving the Site, to contact you for customer service and billing purposes, and, if you \u201copt in\u201d, so that we and third parties can contact you about products and services that may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>We may use your information to send you a welcoming e-mail that may confirm your user name and password.\nIf you opt in, we and third parties may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about the Site, products, services, information and news that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback.\nIf you no longer desire to receive these communications, we will provide you with the option to change your preferences.\nIf you identify yourself to us by sending us an e-mail with questions or comments, we may use your information (including personally identifiable information) to respond to your questions or comments, and we may file your questions or comments (with your information) for future reference.\nWe may also use the information collected to send announcements and updates regarding the Site or, if applicable, about your billing account status.\nYou will not be able to unsubscribe from these Site announcements and updates as they contain important information relevant to your use of the Site.</p>\n<p>We may also use the information gathered to perform statistical analysis of user behavior or to evaluate and improve the Site.\nWe may link some of this information to personally identifiable information for internal purposes or to improve your experience with the Site.</p>\nWhen does Data Plus Math disclose information to third parties?\n<p>Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically authorized by you, we will not disclose any information we gather from you through the Site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Laws and Legal Rights.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may disclose your information (including personally identifiable information) if we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process.\nWe may disclose personally identifiable information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any agreement with Data Plus Math, to detect fraud, for assistance with a delinquent account, or to protect the safety and/or security of our users, the Site or the general public.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Parties Generally.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may provide to third parties non-personally identifiable information, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of the Site.\nFor example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who use the Site, the demographic breakdown of our users of the Site, or the products and/or services purchased using the Site and the vendors of such products and services.\nIf you opt in, we may also provide to third parties personally identifiable information.\nFor example, we might share our users\u2019 responses to questionnaires and e-mail addresses with third parties in order for third parties to contact users about products and services that may be of interest.&nbsp.\nIn addition to the above, when users use our Site, third parties (including without limitation third-party analytics providers and commercial partners) may directly collect personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information about our users\u2019 online activities over time and across different websites.\nThe third parties to which we may provide or who may independently directly collect personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information may include providers of products or services (including analytics service providers, vendors, consultants and website tracking services), customers, customer partners and vendors or consultants of customers or customer partners, merchants,

Contractors\u201d) to provide specific services and products related to the Site, such as hosting and maintaining the Site, providing credit card processing and fraud screening, and developing applications for the Site.\nIn the course of providing products or services to us, these Outside Contractors may have access to information collected through the Site, including your personally identifiable information.\nWe use reasonable efforts to ensure that these Outside Contractors are capable of (1) protecting the privacy of your personally identifiable information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (2) not using or disclosing your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing us with the products or services for which we contracted or as required by law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sale of Business.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Data Plus Math&nbsp.\nor any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined below), or that portion of Data Plus Math or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Site relates, or in the event that we discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Affiliates</strong>.</p>\n<p>We may disclose information (including personally identifiable information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates.\nFor purposes of this Privacy Policy: \u201cCorporate Affiliate\u201d means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Data Plus Math, whether by ownership or otherwise.\nand \u201ccontrol\u201d means possessing, directly or indirectly, the power to direct or cause the direction of the management, policies or operations of an entity, whether through ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting securities, by contract or otherwise.\nAny information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>\nDoes this privacy policy apply when I link to other websites or services?\n<p>Our Site may provide you with access to other websites and services.\nThis may include providing you with the ability to automatically post updates on Facebook and Twitter.\nPlease be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of any websites or services other than the Site.\nWe encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every such website and service.\nThis Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Site.</p>\nIs the information collected through the site secure?\n<p>We want your information (including personally identifiable information) to remain secure.\nWe strive to provide transmission of your information from your computer or mobile device to our servers through techniques that are consistent with industry standards and to employ administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet.\nThere is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems.\nAs a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk</p>\nCould my information be transferred to other countries?\n<p>Personally identifiable information collected on the Site may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and the Site may be viewed and

of Massachusetts, USA, regardless of your location.</p>\nWhat choices do I have regarding the collection, disclosure and distribution of personally identifiable information?\n<p>Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only use personally identifiable information for the purposes described above or as otherwise disclosed at the time we request such information from you.\nYou

Service Privacy Policy <p>\n<strong>Revised: November 6, 2018</strong>\n</p>\n<p>LiveRamp&nbsp;provides Connectivity Services designed to enable our clients to reach consumers with greater efficiency and more relevant messages across various digital channels, including online, mobile, email, and addressable TV.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to help consumers, clients and partners understand how the LiveRamp Connectivity Services work, what data is involved in these services and what measures we take to respect the privacy of the data with which we have been entrusted.\nAdditionally, we have updated our privacy policy to comply with the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation.</p>\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n<p>The European Union has promulgated a new privacy and security framework called the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d).\nIt imposes a number of obligations on data controllers and data processors and affords data subjects a number of important rights.\nThis document is intended to provide transparency regarding LiveRamp operations in the United States (\u201cLiveRamp\u201d) as required under Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>LiveRamp acts as both a \u201cData Controller\u201d and a \u201cData Processor\u201d under the GDPR.\nLiveRamp acts as a data controller with respect to personal data about its employees in the EU (i.e., human resource data), personal data it collects from its clients and prospective clients (i.e., its own customer relationship management data), and personal data about EU citizens it licenses from others (i.e., EU personal data LiveRamp licenses to its clients).</p>\n<p>LiveRamp acts as a data processor under GDPR to the extent it processes personal data about EU citizens on behalf of its clients.\nIn this instance, our clients are considered data controllers.\nLiveRamp processes the personal data according to contract and written instructions from the data controller.</p>\n<p>This service privacy notice focuses on the personal data that LiveRamp collects and processes that is used for services.\nEmployees of LiveRamp subsidiaries in the European Union should refer to their employee handbook for information regarding LiveRamp\u2019s privacy policies.</p>\n<p>LiveRamp complies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Principles and Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.\nTo learn more about how we collect, use, and retain your personal information when you use our Services in the European Union or member countries, please&nbsp;read our Privacy Shield Policy.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you are a French resident and have queries in regards of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u2018GDPR\u2019) and/or wish to exercise any of your rights as granted by the GDPR, please contact cil@liveramp.com.\nif you are a resident of any other EEA country please visit our Your Rights page as found here:&nbsp;your-rights.liveramp.uk.</p>\nLiveRamp connectivity services\n<p>The LiveRamp Connectivity Services include data onboarding, linking, and distribution to many of the players in the digital advertising industry to enable smarter targeting with more relevant messages and more accurate measurement.\nOnboarding is a service that loads data collected offline into the digital ecosystem, so it can be used for digital advertising purposes.\nThe players include advertisers wishing to reach consumers, advertising supported websites, advertising supported apps, email marketing services, and addressable TV channels.</p>\n<p>Today consumers interact with advertisers and brands through a variety of channels \u2013 offline and digital.\nThis cross channel interaction is known as \u201comni channel.\u201d LiveRamp services are used to support these interactions for several types of entities in the digital advertising industry, including:</p>\n<p>Marketing Platform Partners: LiveRamp has established partnerships for distribution with hundreds of media and technology providers in the online, app, email, and addressable TV ecosystem.\nWith these partners, LiveRamp enables advertisers to display relevant ads to specific individuals through websites, mobile apps, email, and addressable TVs.</p>\n<p>Third Party Data Providers: LiveRamp also offers services that allow third-party data providers, to onboard their offline marketing data and sync their digital data in such a way that it can be used by advertisers to display more relevant ads and email marketing to consumers.</p>\n<p>Brands: LiveRamp offers connectivity services to digital marketers that advertise to consumers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Brands can onboard their proprietary offline and digital data for their own use to target advertising messages on their own website and/or their own mobile apps, and in email.</li>\n<li>Brands can use their own onboarded proprietary data along with third party onboarded data to offer more relevant ads and email marketing through LiveRamp partners.</li>\n<li>Brands can also connect performance information about their omni-channel ad and email marketing campaigns to understand how to improve the effectiveness of future campaigns.\nPerformance information includes data about who viewed the ad, who clicked on the ad, as well as who actually responded in some way to the offer.</li>\n</ul>\nOther Digital Partners:\n<p>There are other players in the digital advertising industry that LiveRamp partners with to enable our Connectivity Services.\nThese include cookie, mobile and addressable TV match partners that allow LiveRamp to recognize an individual across various channels.\nIn addition, LiveRamp sells Connectivity Services to other third party advertising service providers to help facilitate their offerings.</p>\nConnectivity services work across channels\n<p>Due to technical differences across the channels, LiveRamp uses different approaches tailored specifically to each channel to provide our Connectivity Services.\nThe common basis of these services is an ID that LiveRamp assigns to an individual.\nThe ID may be used in a personally identifiable state or in a manner that is not used to identify the individual, depending on the channel and the use.</p>\n<p>LiveRamp collects certain types of information in connection with our Connectivity Services.\nThis includes personal data such as name, postal address, email address, and phone number if permitted by our partners and clients through policy notices they have provided to consumers.\nWe also collect other data such as IP address, mobile device ID, and browser and operating system type and version.\nIn addition, we handle, process, and share this data with our marketing platform partners in the course of performing our services.\nhowever we do not retain or use this data for our own internal business purposes unless permitted by our clients.</p>\nLiveRamp Cookie-based Connectivity Services\n<p>Connectivity Services for cookie-based integrations are based on a LiveRamp ID and a LiveRamp cookie that together identify a browser.\nThe cookie containing the ID is set when a consumer visits the website of one of our cookie match partners as a registered user, or when a consumer opens certain emails from a cookie match partner.\nBecause match partners know the consumer, they enable LiveRamp to recognize the consumer as well and set the LiveRamp cookie containing the appropriate ID.</p>\n<p>For example, our match partners may enable us to place or recognize a cookie on your computer or device, and our match partners may share personal data with us, such as your name, postal address, or email address.\nLiveRamp uses the personal data to link an ID to information stored in your browser or device.\nWe also may collect information such as the device\u2019s IP address and browser or operating systems type and version.\nWe use this information to recognize consumers across different channels and platforms over time for the purposes of facilitating online advertising, analytics, attribution, fraud detection, and reporting purposes.</p>\n<p>For cookie-based integrations, three types of connections are maintained.\nThe first is the connection between LiveRamp cookies and marketing platform partner cookies, a sync that enables LiveRamp to distribute advertising data to partners on behalf of our clients.\nIn this case, the LiveRamp cookies containing LiveRamp IDs are synced with cookies set by our marketing platform partners.</p>\n<p>The second connection is between LiveRamp cookies and third-party data providers.\nIn this case, third party data providers onboard their data and LiveRamp matches it to the appropriate LiveRamp IDs, thereby connecting the data to the correct LiveRamp cookie.</p>\n<p>Finally, the third connection is between a brand\u2019s data and the LiveRamp cookie.\nWhen marketers onboard their data, LiveRamp associates the brand\u2019s data with the LiveRamp ID, thus connecting this data to the LiveRamp cookies.</p>\n<p>Once all these connections are made, a marketer can use them to understand how ad or email marketing campaigns perform and deliver ads or offline marketing to specific individuals when they visit a website with ad inventory.\nFor example, we may facilitate the delivery of an ad to an individual in his or her web browser based on a purchase he or she made in a physical retail store, or we may enable a brand to send a personalized marketing email to that individual based on the fact that he or she visited a particular website.</p>\n<p>LiveRamp cookies are set with an RLCDN.com name and expire from LiveRamp\u2019s system after 90 days unless they are renewed or refreshed.\nUnlike web \u201ctracking\u201d cookies, LiveRamp cookies do not \u201ctrack\u201d users\u2019 behavior across websites.\nInstead, LiveRamp cookies are used to recognize an individual so that relevant ads and email marketing can be delivered to the intended recipient.</p>\nLiveRamp Mobile Connectivity Services\n<p>Connectivity Services for mobile ID integrations are similar to cookie integrations except they use the mobile advertising ID assigned to the device instead of a cookie \u2013 namely the Apple ID for Advertising (IDFA) and the Android Advertising ID (AAID).\nWe associate the LiveRamp ID with the mobile ID just like we would associate the cookie.\nLiveRamp links marketing platform partners, third party data providers, and data from a brand to mobile devices through the LiveRamp ID.</p>\n<p>Mobile advertising IDs do not expire like cookies.\nInstead the device gives the user the ability to change the ID at any time, thus breaking the connection between the old ID and the device.\nConsistent with our online policy, LiveRamp IDs are used to recognize individuals so relevant ads and offline marketing can be delivered and campaigns can be measured.</p>\nLiveRamp Addressable TV Connectivity Services:\n<p>Connectivity Services for addressable TV integrations are similar to online and mobile services except they use the subscriber ID assigned by the carrier to the set-top box instead of a cookie or a mobile ID.\nWe associate the LiveRamp ID with the subscriber ID just like we would associate the cookie or mobile ID.\nLiveRamp links marketing platform partners, third party data providers, and data from a brand to subscriber IDs through the LiveRamp ID.</p>\n<p>Addressable TV subscriber IDs do not expire like cookies.\nInstead the carrier gives the user the ability to determine if they wish to see targeted advertising on their TV.\nConsistent with our online and mobile policy, LiveRamp IDs are used only to recognize individuals so relevant ads can be delivered and campaigns can be measured.</p>\nPersonal Data versus Anonymous Connectivity:\n<p>LiveRamp may recognize an online, mobile or addressable TV user in two ways.\nFirst when our match partner shares personal data with us, or second when they share other information with us that is not used to identify individuals.\nWhen they share personal data, we can recognize a consumer on an identifiable basis.\nHowever, to preserve user privacy, we create a unique LiveRamp ID when we combine it with other anonymous data.</p>\n<p>LiveRamp values the preservation of consumer privacy, designing its systems and services to treat personal data and other information that is not used to identify individuals with utmost care.\nLiveRamp chooses the appropriate LiveRamp ID, either personal data or de-identified, based on the services it has been asked to perform.\nit does not mingle the two in any way that compromises user protections or choice.</p>\nLegal Basis of Processing\n<p>In terms of how we work with our partners and clients under GDPR, our processing of personal data will be legitimized as follows:</p>\n<p>(i) Whenever we require consent for the processing of personal data such processing will be justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit.\n(a) of GDPR.\nThis article in the GDPR describes when processing can be done lawfully;<br>\n(ii) And where the processing is necessary for the purpose of LiveRamp\u2019s legitimate interest, such processing will be made in accordance with GDPR Article 6(1) lit.\n(f).</p>\nData Retention\n<p>The data we hold is non-sensitive personal data and not subject to any sector specific data retention requirements.\nWe retain data collected for our data products for as long as it is useful in our products, either as an actual variable or in order to derive other variables.\nPersonal data not used for any purpose is deleted.\nIf someone objects to us processing their data, we will remove it from our data products, and then from our environment in accordance with our data deletion cycle unless we have a valid justification to hold on to it such as to resolve disputes or comply with our legal obligations.</p>\n<p>Your choices and how to contact us about LiveRamp data connectivity services</p>\nOpting-out of LiveRamp connectivity services\n<p>LiveRamp gives consumers the opportunity to opt-out of all our Connectivity Services.\nClick&nbsp;here&nbsp;to learn about permanent email-based opt-out features and to access our cookie-based opt-out.\nWe also offer a mobile device ID opt-out&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>LiveRamp is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance Canada&nbsp;(DAAC) and adheres to the DAA Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising and Multi-Site Data, as well as related guidance.\nLiveRamp subscribes to the DAA\u2019s industry-wide cookie opt-out mechanism that can be found&nbsp;here&nbsp;and its mobile device ID opt out available through its AppChoices app.\nConsumers who choose to opt out through these DAA mechanisms do not need to opt out of the equivalent mechanism with LiveRamp.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that opting out of LiveRamp through our opt-out channels or through the DAA does not disable advertisements altogether.\nInstead, opting out means that LiveRamp services will no longer be used to facilitate targeted advertising to your browser, device, or email address.\nIn other words, you will still see advertisements and receive email marketing, but they will be less relevant to you.</p>\n<p>If you create a new email address, reset the mobile advertising ID on your device, or use a new browser, you will need to apply the appropriate opt out to that new email address, new device ID, and/or new browser as opt-outs are not necessarily transferred between email addresses, browsers, or devices.</p>\nOpting-out of LiveRamp connectivity services\n<p>LiveRamp requires that our partners meet the same high standards we have.\nWe contractually require that our match partners employ notice and choice mechanisms, and we work with other information service providers and our partners to assist them in following their respective industry standards.</p>\nData Transfers\n<p>Where business needs exist, LiveRamp intends to transfer personal data to entities outside the US and EU.\nHowever, your personal data will not be transferred unless a valid transfer mechanism is in place legitimizing such a transfer.\nIn the case referred to in Article 46,47, or the second paragraph of Article 49(1), this will typically involve EU model clauses or the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.\nSafeguards afforded by the EU model clauses may be accessed&nbsp;here.</p>\nHow to contact us\n<p>If you wish to contact our privacy team about LiveRamp Connectivity Services, please send an email to&nbsp;consumercare@liveramp.com.\nOur principle place of business is 225 Bush Street, 17th Floor, San Francisco, CA.\n94104.</p>\nSupervisory Authority\n<p>If you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection.\nYou may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Products<ul>\n<li>Our Platform</li>\n<li>Why Data
