example, if you signed up using a personal email address and invited a couple of friends to work on a new startup idea but haven\u2019t formed a company yet, you are the Customer.\nHowever if you sign up using a primary email address with a domain owned by your company, and you have the necessary authority to bind your company to these Terms, then your company is the Customer.</p>\n<p>An \u201cAuthorized User\u201d is a person who a Customer, or a person with admin access on a Customer\u2019s account, has invited to participate in a Customer account.</p>2.\nAcceptance of the Terms<p>By creating an account, or by entering into an agreement to purchase a Subscription (as defined below), you agree, as an individual or on behalf of the organization that you represent, as applicable, to be bound by these Terms as Customer.</p>\n<p>By accepting an invitation to join a team or organization account created by a Customer or otherwise indicating your assent to these Terms,
