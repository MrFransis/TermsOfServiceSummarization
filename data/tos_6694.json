but your decision to utilise these features and provide such data will always be voluntary.</p>\n<p>In other words,</p>\n<p>Data we're collecting helps us keep the site running and fix bugs.\nIf you

writing or written means to email.</p>\n<p>In other words,</p>\n<p>This mighty document is our legal terms.\nExciting stuff, but worth taking a few minutes to look through to understand what it means to you.</p>\n<p>We've tried to summarise the main points of each section, to make our terms a little more digestable.</p> 2.\n<strong>Our contract with you</strong> 2.1.\n<p>These Terms are a contract between you, the User, and JS Bin Limited (\u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), a company incorporated in England and Wales under company number 08998555 with its registered office at 44 Burstead Close, Brighton BN1 7HT (\u2018 <strong>JS Bin</strong>\u2019).</p> 2.2.\n<p>JS Bin operates jsbin.com which includes other domains from time to time which direct to jsbin.com via DNS aliases (the \u2018 <strong>JS Bin Site</strong>\u2019) and the JS Bin creation service contained therein.\nBy using the JS Bin Site and any services accessible from the JS Bin Site, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms.\nIf you do not agree to these Terms or any part thereof, your only remedy is to not use the JS Bin Site or any services or products offered on the JS Bin Site or on any other platform, including mobile applications, offered by JS Bin (collectively, the \u2018 <strong>Service</strong>\u2019 or \u2018 <strong>Services</strong>\u2019).</p> 2.3.\n<p>Breach of these Terms or any part thereof will entitle JS Bin to terminate your right to use the Service.\nAny account you may have created will be deleted.\nJS Bin reserves the right to refuse provision of the Service to anyone at their complete discretion.</p> 2.4.\n<p>You agree and accept that your use of the Service is entirely at your own risk.</p> 2.5.\n<p>These Terms will apply for as long as you use the JS Bin Site and/or the Services.\nAny part of these Terms that by necessity or implication are to continue after your use of the JS Bin Site or the Services ends (including the licence under clause 5.1) shall continue in force.</p>\n<p>In other words,</p>\n<p>There are a few rules which we need to play by.\nWe run jsbin.com and all the sites under that domain.</p>\n<p>If you break the rules by Being a Jerk\u2122 then we reserve the right to remove your user and your Bins from JS&nbsp;Bin.</p> 3.\n<strong>Your account</strong> 3.1.\n<p>In order to create an Account on the JS Bin Site you must agree to be bound by these Terms and you must provide such information as is reasonably requested by JS Bin during the registration process.\nYou warrant the accuracy and completeness of such information while you are using the Service.\nIf you operate as an Anonymous User and do not register and create an Account you will still be bound by these Terms by virtue of your use and the reasonable implication that such use of the Services and functionality provided by the JS Bin Site would require acceptance of reasonable Terms of Use such as these.</p> 3.2.\n<p>Your Account will feature the Services which you select from the packages available to Users from time to time (currently Anonymous User, Free User and Pro User) and your choice of Account will determine whether or not your Bins will be available for public dissemination or whether you can elect to keep them private.\nYou can upgrade your Account and similarly you can downgrade it at your discretion subject only to the payment terms for any paid for Account.</p> 3.3.\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password.\nYou agree that you shall be solely responsible for any loss or damage resulting from failure to comply with this obligation.</p> 3.4.\n<p>You shall use all reasonable endeavours to prevent any unauthorised access to, or use of, the Services and/or the Documentation and, in the event of any such unauthorised access or use, promptly notify JS Bin.</p> 3.5.\n<p>Accounts registered by \u2018bots\u2019 or other automated methods are not permitted.</p>\n<p>In other words,</p>\n<p>If you use JS Bin, you're bound by these terms.\nIf you create an account, please use your own email address.</p>\n<p>Pro (aka \"paid for accounts\") accounts let you create private Bins, otherwise all your Bins are public by default.</p>\n<p>You're responsible for your own account.\nAlso, if you're a robot: you're not allowed a JS Bin account.</p> 3.6.\n<p>You are responsible for all content, code, features, comments, graphics or text that you may post on the JS Bin Site (the \u2018 <strong>Content</strong>\u2019) and activity that occurs under

distribute Content you submit, post or display on the JS Bin Site in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).\nSuch Content shall be licensed upon the terms of the MIT licence.</p> 5.2.\n<p>If you specifically save a Bin as private on the JS Bin Site, and that Bin has never been public on the JS Bin Site or anywhere else, the code in that particular Bin is unlicensed.</p>\n<p>In other words,</p>\n<p>Public Bins you build on JS Bin are MIT licensed, meaning other people are free to use it for whatever they like as long as that is also MIT licensed.\nDon't put anything on JS Bin where that wouldn't be okay.\nPrivate Bins are un-licensed so that you may apply your own license and retain direct ownership.</p> 5.3.\n<p>You agree that the licence in clause 5.1 includes the right for JS Bin and other users of the Services to make your Content available to others for the publication, distribution, syndication, or broadcast of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use.\nSuch additional uses by JS Bin or others may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Services.</p>\n<p>In other words,</p>\n<p>People don't have to pay to see your Bins.</p> 5.4.\n<p>JS Bin may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.</p>\n<p>In other words,</p>\n<p>People can create clones of your Bins.</p> 5.5.\n<p>You warrant, represent and agree that you have the right to grant JS Bin the licence in clause 5.1.\nYou also represent, warrant and agree that you have not and will not contribute any Content that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>infringes or otherwise interferes with any copyright or trade mark of another party;</li>\n<li>reveals any confidential information or trade secret, unless the confidential information or trade secret belongs to you or you have the owner's permission to disclose it.\nor</li>\n<li>infringes any intellectual property right of another or the privacy or publicity rights of another.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In other words,</p>\n<p>Don't infringe on other people's copyright.</p> 5.6.\n<p>You are responsible for your use of the Service, for any Content you provide, and for any consequences thereof, including the use of your Content by other users and third party partners.\nYou understand that your Content may be republished and if you do not have the right to submit Content for such use, it may subject you to liability.\nJS Bin will not be responsible or liable for any use of your Content in accordance with these Terms.\n</p> 5.7.\n<p>JS Bin cannot monitor or control the Content posted via the Services.\nAny use of or reliance on the Content posted via the Services or obtained by your through the Services is at your own risk.\nWe do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the

Content, or any loss of damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of the Content made available via the Services.</p>\n<p>In other words,</p>\n<p>We don't monitor what you post on JS Bin, nor

Bin Site is billed in advance on a monthly basis in accordance with our pricing schedule and all payments are non-refundable.\nThere will be no refunds or credits for partial months of Service,

features.</p>\n<p>You're responsible for your taxes.</p> 7.\n<strong> JS Bin\u2019s obligations</strong> 7.1.\n<p>Subject to the other Terms, JS Bin undertakes to use its reasonable endeavours to provide that the Services will be available for use and in accordance with the Documentation.</p> 7.2.\n<p>The undertaking at clause 7.1 shall not apply to the extent of any non-conformance which is
