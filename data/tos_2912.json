pleased to grant you, an individual consumer, a personal, non-transferable, nonexclusive term-limited license to install and use any Software and Services for which you have purchased a subscription for personal use on the number of devices and for the number of users specified in your License Entitlement or Service Entitlement, as applicable, subject to the System Requirements .</p>\n<p>\"License Entitlement\" means the number and type of devices and users that are permitted to use the Software, as specified in the documents that accompanied your purchase or download, which (depending upon the channel from which you purchased the license) may include: the checkout payment page, a product description page on our website, the email confirmation that we send for the

Entitlement is for a single device and user.</p>\n<p>\"Service Entitlement\" means the scope and duration of the Services you purchased, as specified in documents made available to you when you

be made by you or us within the statute of limitations that is applicable to the Claim(s) upon which arbitration is sought or required.&nbsp.\nThese notice obligations do not modify the statute of limitations that is applicable to any Claim(s).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Administration of Arbitration.</b> If any dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation, any claim, dispute, or controversy will be, at the demand of either party, conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), and not state law.\nSubject only to the Small Claims Court Option for individual consumers described below,&nbsp;<b>YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR

written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nAll arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English, and the United States FAA will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the binding arbitration clause in this Agreement.\nThe award will be confidential and only disclosed as is necessary to obtain judgment or as otherwise required by law.\nYou and we further agree that a judgment may be entered upon the award by any court having jurisdiction.\nThe arbitration award will determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only, and only in respect to the claims in arbitration, and will not have any bearing on the rights and obligations of any other dispute.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Costs.\n</b>The party initiating the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee.\nIf you file the arbitration and an award is rendered in your favor, we will reimburse your filing fee.\nWe will pay the fees and costs for the first day of any hearing.\nAll other fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the arbitration rules.\nHowever, we will advance or reimburse filing and other fees if the arbitrator rules that you cannot afford to pay them or if you ask us and we determine there is a good reason for doing so.\nEach party will bear the expense of their respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses and other expenses, regardless of who prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Small Claims Court Option.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are an individual consumer, you may choose to sue us in small claims court in your county of residence or in Santa

appropriate jurisdiction.\nprovided, however, that we may elect to arbitrate any dispute related to such provisional remedies.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Conflicting Terms.</b> In the event of a conflict between the Arbitration Rules and this arbitration agreement, this arbitration agreement will govern.\nIf any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the other provisions of the arbitration agreement.\nprovided, however, that (a) if the prohibition on class-wide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration agreement will be null and void.\nand (b) if the prohibition on arbitration of representative claims brought in a private attorney general capacity is deemed invalid, then the arbitration agreement will be null and void as to such claims only.\nThis arbitration agreement will survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.\nIn the event of a conflict between this arbitration agreement and any other applicable arbitration provision, this arbitration agreement will control.</p>\n<p>\n<b>WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.\nIF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT

your data to another device or location.\nThat way, you have another copy of the data that the attacking software has deleted, modified, or destroyed.\nWhile we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove the attacking malware or virus, it is your sole and exclusive responsibility to back-up all data and files on your device so that they can be restored in the event of an attack on
