Agreement shall be treated as though it were executed and performed in the State of New York and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law principles).&nbsp;<strong>Should a dispute arise concerning the Surveys2Cash Offerings, the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties in New York, NY, in accordance with the then current commercial arbitration rules of a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties.\nand (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice which can be found&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>\n<u>here</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.\nWe may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice (\"Final Settlement Offer\").\nIf we provide you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, you can submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties, in your county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is also available on the Site&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>\n<u>here</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.\nFor claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.\nIf the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys' fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration.\nAny award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration.\nand/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration.\nAlthough we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against Surveys2Cash and/or its employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns.\nYou agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit.\nYou agree to pay the attorney's fees and court costs that Surveys2Cash incurs in seeking such relief.\nThis provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (A) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above.\nand (B) is an independent agreement.\nYou may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Site.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17 - MISCELLANEOUS.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Should any part of the Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\nTo the extent that anything in or associated with any Surveys2Cash Offerings is in conflict or inconsistent with the Agreement, the Agreement shall take precedence.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that there is any inconsistency between these Terms and Conditions.\nOur failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision.\nThe parties do not intend that any agency or partnership relationship be created through operation of the Agreement.\nSurveys2Cash may assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice to you.\nThe Agreement may not, however, be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under the Agreement.\nHeadings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18 - CALIFORNIA USER CONSUMER RIGHTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In accordance with Cal.\nCiv.\nCode Sec.\n1789.3, California State resident users may file
