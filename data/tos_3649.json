28, 2020</strong>\n</p>\nThe NoodleTools Platform \u2014 An Educational Service that is Truly Private\n<p>NoodleTools is designed as a private and secure teaching and learning space for schools and students.\nThis Privacy Policy describes our stringent policies for protecting personal information in clear language that you \u2013 as an administrator, teacher, parent or student \u2013 can understand.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under 13, other than for the specific requirement described in the \u201cThird-Party Authentication Systems\u201d section of this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>We do not collect, maintain, use or share personal information beyond what is necessary for authorized educational/school or legal purposes.</li>\n<li>We will never sell any personal information to any third party.</li>\n<li>There is no tracking of any personal information for third-party or marketing purposes on NoodleTools.</li>\n<li>We will never expose any student, teacher, or other user of NoodleTools to any third-party advertisements on our site.</li>\n<li>NoodleTools, Inc.\ncomplies with all applicable federal and state data privacy laws including the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) and the Family Educational and Privacy Rights Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d).</li>\n<li>For EU subscribers, NoodleTools, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework, the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the protection of personal data and digital privacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Scope of this Privacy Policy\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all parts of the NoodleTools service (\u201cService\u201d), as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cNoodleTools,\u201d our online research management platform for students and teachers.</li>\n<li>\u201cNoodleTools Companion,\u201d our iOS and Android mobile application for NoodleTools subscribers.</li>\n<li>Single-sign-on options available for authentication (currently Google, Microsoft 365, and Clever).</li>\n<li>\u201cHave a Question?\u201d our email-based expert help service for users with research questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By using the Service, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy.\nYou can see when it was last updated by looking at the last updated date at the top of this page.</p>\n<p>If we make any significant changes to our Privacy Policy, we\u2019ll post a notification prominently on the NoodleTools homepage.&nbsp;Individual subscribers and school account administrators will also be notified of any significant changes to this policy via email.&nbsp;Continued use of the website after a revision to the Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance and agreement to the current Privacy Policy.\nWe recommend that you periodically review the Privacy Policy to make sure you understand and are up-to-date on how we\u2019re keeping your information safe.</p>\nGuiding Principles for Student/User Privacy\n<p>For any Site subscribing to NoodleTools, we follow these guiding principles related to identifiable personal information and privacy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>NoodleTools, Inc.\nupholds COPPA, FERPA, EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework, Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and related regulations.</li>\n<li>For any student accessing NoodleTools from a K12 Site subscription, neither name nor email address nor other personally identifiable information is required for a student to create personal folders or otherwise use NoodleTools or NoodleTools Companion.\nOur commitment to COPPA and the protection of children under 13 thus extends beyond the COPPA requirement and to all K12 students at a Site, regardless of age.</li>\n<li>Within the NoodleTools classroom environment, a student is identifiable by a screen name or name of choice.\nFor children under 13, the prompt for this screen name specifically instructs them to supply only a first name and last initial.</li>\n<li>For group work, a teacher or classroom peers may not access any student\u2019s folder for purposes of viewing and providing feedback unless the student expressly provides that permission.\nOur guiding principle is that the student is the owner and author of his or her work, and thus must grant permission allowing a teacher or peer to gain a view into that work.</li>\n<li>Students and teachers can only provide access to their folders on a Project-by-Project basis with those within the private and limited scope of the Site, and not beyond.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For any Individual subscribing personally to NoodleTools (i.e.\nnot through a school or university Site subscription), we follow these guiding principles related to identifiable personal information and privacy.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your name and email address collected at registration are associated with your account, for purposes of password reset.</li>\n<li>Students under 13 are expressly requested to obtain parental permission before signing up for an Individual NoodleTools account.\n(Since Individual accounts are primarily subscribed by university students and scholars, it is infrequent that a young child under 13 would seek access to NoodleTools on an individual basis.)</li>\n<li>Projects created in Individual accounts are not shareable or viewable by any other person.</li>\n</ol>\nCollection and Processing of Personal Information (PII)\n<p>Any Personal Information collected and processed by NoodleTools will always be done so with the consent of its users and for the specific purposes outlined below, which are necessary for the operations of the Service.</p>\nInformation Necessary to Subscribe\n<p>There are two types of subscribers to our Service.\nA \u201cSite Subscriber\u201d is typically a school, school library, district, state, university, or consortium using the classroom version of NoodleTools.\nAn \u201cIndividual Subscriber\u201d is a single person \u2013 typically a scholar or a university or graduate student \u2013 who uses the non-classroom version of NoodleTools for independent research.</p>\n<p>When either a Site or Individual subscribes to NoodleTools, we collect only the minimal pieces of information that we need for subscription registration and billing purposes.\nUsernames, passwords, and IP addresses collected for the purpose of site-access authentication are held in the strictest confidence.</p>\n<p>NoodleTools, Inc.\nis the sole owner of any information collected for subscription purposes.\nWe will not sell, share, or distribute this information in any way, or use it for any other purpose than for site access authentication and subscription/renewal processes.\nSuch collected information may be provided to an entity that purchases all or substantially all of the business or assets of NoodleTools, Inc.\nthrough a merger, financing, acquisition, or bankruptcy transaction or proceeding (\u201cSuccessor Entity\u201d), assuming that the Successor Entity has data privacy principles that are consistent with the principles described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>For Site accounts, payment may be made by physical check, wire/ACH, or credit card.\nNo credit card or other payment information is stored in our database, nor kept in any electronic or paper version.</p>\n<p>For Individual accounts, payment is made through an external payment services and we do not see or handle the credit card or payment information.\nPursuant to COPPA, for children under 13 requesting an individual account, there is specific language on our submission form counseling the child to obtain parental permission, and have the parent complete the credit card payment.</p>\nOne-Time Use of Email\n<p>Under the \u201cLimited Exceptions to COPPA\u2019s Verifiable Parental Consent Requirement,\u201d when a student working in NoodleTools uses the function to email their work to themselves or another person, the email address is used in a one-time manner for that purpose.</p>\nWithholding Personal Information\n<p>In situations where Personal Information is collected, if you choose to withhold any personal data requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to certain parts of the site or for us to respond to your queries.</p>\nPassive Information Collection Technologies for Internal Operations\n<p>Some Privacy Frameworks like GDPR consider IP address logs to constitute personal information.\nThus, no identifiers are ever used except for to provide support for our internal operations, site and service.\nFurthermore, IP addresses are never shared with any third parties.\nIn order to compile usage statistics for subscribing organizations, we also record the date and time that users access the Service, and from what IP address they log in.</p>\nCookies\n<p>Certain information is stored by NoodleTools using session and persistent cookies.\nThose cookies are used for the express and limited purpose of maintaining the user\u2019s active session and login preferences, and to customize the user\u2019s experience within NoodleTools.</p>\n<p>You can control whether or not cookies are allowed through your browser.\nIf you choose to disable cookies, it may limit use of certain features or functions of the website and/or NoodleTools platform.</p>\nExternal Links and Third-Party Integrations\n<p>No ads are served from the NoodleTools website or Service, but many NoodleTools pages do contain links to other websites.\nThere is no exchange of personal information by NoodleTools to any external service or website.</p>\n<p>When a user asks a citation question via the \u201cHave a Question?\u201d link in NoodleTools or submits a ticket through our Help Desk, an email address is used on a one-time basis to respond to that query.\nBoth \u201cHave a Question?\u201d and the Help Desk are facilitated through FreshDesk.\nIn addition to FreshDesk\u2019s standard privacy policy, NoodleTools, Inc.\nhas entered into a separate stringent agreement with FreshDesk regarding data privacy and security of NoodleTools user data, guaranteeing that they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this privacy policy and implemented by NoodleTools.</p>\n<p>In addition to FreshDesk, NoodleTools utilizes the services of&nbsp;other companies to perform certain business-related services.\nWe may disclose personal information to certain types of third-party companies but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services.\nNoodleTools currently uses services such as Stripe for credit card processing, Sumo Logic for server monitoring, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) and related Amazon Cloud services for hosting, database management and backup.\nThese and all such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require they provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by this privacy policy and implemented by NoodleTools.</p>\n<p>NoodleTools can connect to Google Docs or Word Online through APIs, if a student wishes to export citations and notecards to those services.\nIf the user is not already authenticating through one of those services, NoodleTools prompts for the user\u2019s G Suite or Office 365 ID to facilitate this integration, and that ID is not used by NoodleTools for any other purpose.</p>\nThird-Party Authentication Systems (Google, Microsoft 365, Clever)\n<p>Third-party authentication systems may provide passive access to student personal information that NoodleTools, Inc.\ndoes not access or store due to our own stringent privacy policy.\nFor example, if a school shares data through Clever with NoodleTools, students\u2019 gender and date of birth are included, but that information is not used or stored in the NoodleTools database.\nThe only user information stored is name and email address, and those are used solely for authentication purposes.\nIf you decide to use Google, Microsoft 365, or Clever Authentication Services for access to NoodleTools, it shall be consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that NoodleTools, Inc.\nis not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of any other website or service.\nWe encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy policies and terms of service of all websites that they visit.\nThis Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by NoodleTools.\nThe use of all external services or websites are at your own risk, regardless of whether such services are linked or connected to NoodleTools, and NoodleTools, Inc.\nshall have no liability related to the use of any external service or website.</p>\nOur Security Practices\n<p>NoodleTools, Inc.\nmaintains a security program that is designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality and integrity of the student personal information against risks such as unauthorized access or use, or unintended or inappropriate disclosure.\nOur data is stored in the United States with robust digital and procedural safeguards in place to protect your personal information.\nAll passwords are securely encrypted within our database, which has daily backups and is protected by SSH and a firewall.\nAll actions that involve the digital transmission of personal data are handled by 256-bit encryption.</p>\n<p>As previously noted, the Service has minimal collection of personal information, and minimal integration with services that could cause any unintended transference of personal information.\nIf you have any questions about the security at our website, you can contact us via the NoodleTools Help Desk.</p>\n<p>NoodleTools, Inc.\nwill quickly respond to and mitigate any private user data breach, as summarized in our Breach Response Plan.</p>\nData Retention, Destruction, Correction\n<p>To the extent allowed by applicable law, NoodleTools, Inc.\nretains personally identifiable information provided by you after the termination of your relationship with us.\nThis is done to allow an individual, school or district to renew a subscription that had previously expired, without any loss of the work done by students and teachers within that account.\nIf a K12 Site requests that NoodleTools delete or destroy personally identifiable student information after the termination of its relationship with us, we will take commercially reasonable efforts to do so within 60 days.\nprovided, however, that NoodleTools, Inc.\nmay retain aggregated and anonymized data.</p>\n<p>If a parent, student, principal, or teaching staff member would like to make corrections to data that has been collected they can either submit a request to the NoodleTools Help Desk or submit a letter to the following address: NoodleTools, Inc., PO Box 60214, Palo Alto, CA 94306.</p>\nInternational Compliance\nEU &amp.\nSwiss Privacy
