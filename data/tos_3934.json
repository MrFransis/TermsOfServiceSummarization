in accordance with the&nbsp;Limited Warranty, Returns and Cancellations Policy.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information that\u2019s been de-identified.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners.\nWe may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience.\nHowever, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertisers:</strong>&nbsp;We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (\u201c<strong>Advertisers</strong>\u201d) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers.\nFor example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.&nbsp.\nOr, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.&nbsp.\nNote that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain

\u201cweb beacon\u201d) from an ad network.&nbsp.\nWeb beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.&nbsp.\nWeb beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.&nbsp.\nBecause your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network\u2019s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.&nbsp.\nYou may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser.\nplease note that we don\u2019t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Affiliated Businesses:</strong>&nbsp;In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we\u2019re affiliated with may sell or provide products or

we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.\nOne such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account.\nWe have no control over

business, please review all such business\u2019 or websites\u2019 policies.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Agents:</strong>&nbsp;We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and

who make certain services, features or functionality available to our users on our behalf.\nUnless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>User Profiles and Submissions:</strong>\n<em>\n<strong>\n</strong>&nbsp;</em>Certain User Submissions, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our Services.&nbsp.\nYour account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others, including Caregivers.&nbsp.\nPlease remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone.&nbsp.\nAdditionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of \u201cfriends\u201d from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such \u201cfriends,\u201d if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile.&nbsp.\nAgain, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Transfers:</strong>&nbsp;We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.<em>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</em>Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of

verify that the types and number of pills dispensed accurately match the prescribed dosage before ingesting the contents of the pill cup.&nbsp.\nKeep track of pills inside the Dispenser (e.g., by size, shape, color, imprint, or form) to help ensure that dispensed doses match prescribed doses.\nIf you cannot visually differentiate between the different types of pills you intend to store in the Dispenser, do not add those medications to the device.\nStore the original prescriptions or pill bottles in a safe, accessible place for reference after loading appropriate medications into the Dispenser, and leave one or more pills in their original container to help you identify each pill, and in case you ever experience a mechanical or software failure with the Dispenser.\nSoftgels, half pills, gummies, liquid medications and medications that require refrigeration should not be stored in the Dispenser.&nbsp.\nThe Dispenser has a discrete lifespan that depends on various factors, including but not limited to the type and amount of pills used, the number of dispenses, and the environmental conditions in which the Dispenser is operated.&nbsp.\nAs the Dispenser nears the end of its useful life, when a Dispenser requires maintenance, or, in certain other circumstances, you may experience unsuccessful dispenses.&nbsp.\nUnsuccessful dispenses while rare, may occur.&nbsp.\nIn the event that the Dispenser is unable to dispense a full or partial dose, the Dispenser will typically, but not always, notify you (and your caregiver, if applicable) of the unsuccessful dispense, and prompt you with a resolution depending on the situation (for example: offer to retrieve your scheduled dose manually, contact Hero Health, or other).\nIf you experience repeated unsuccessful dispenses, you should contact Hero Health at 855-855-9962 for further instructions.&nbsp.\nIt is possible, though unlikely, that the Dispenser may fail to notify you of an unsuccessful dispense, that pills may stick together resulting in the dispensing of extra pills, and that pills may be deposited into and dispensed from other pill reservoirs resulting in the dispensing of incorrect dosages, thus, it is imperative that you verify each dispense.&nbsp.\n<br>If you are unable or unwilling to utilize or interact with this dispense method, or if you believe that doing so would cause you to take an incorrect dose of medication, you should not use the Dispenser.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You must store the Dispenser and your medications in a safe place.\nIf children or other individuals who may be harmed by gaining unsupervised access to the medications are present, the Dispenser should be installed beyond their reach with passcode protection enabled for all medication dispenses.&nbsp.\nThe Dispenser should also be stored in a room that is no warmer than 77\u00ba F (25\u00ba C) and with humidity no higher than 20%.&nbsp.\nYou should not use the Dispenser in a location that has an altitude of more than 8,000 feet.\nYou are solely liable for any unauthorized access to the Dispenser and your medications.&nbsp.\nHero Health will not be liable for any injury resulting or arising from, or related to, the use of the Services (even if unauthorized) whatsoever.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your use of the Services does not create a doctor-patient or provider-patient

requested or received payment.&nbsp.\nWe also reserve the right to change our billing methods at any time.\nany changes to billing methods will be posted on or through our website or the App.&nbsp.\nYour continued use of the Paid Services after changes have taken effect means that you accept such changes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>Payment Method</em>.\nThe terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.\nIf we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.\nAll payments must be made in U.S.\ndollars.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>Recurring Billing</em>.\nSome of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you.\nBy choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.&nbsp.\nSUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT.&nbsp.\nTO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS<strong>\n</strong>OR CONTACT US AT <strong>support@herohealth.com.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Current Information Required</em>.\nYou must provide current, complete and accurate information for your Billing Account.\nYou must promptly update all information to keep your Billing Account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify us or our Payment Processor if your Payment Method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password.&nbsp.\nChanges to such information can be made in your account settings.\nhowever, this may temporarily disrupt your access to the Paid Services while Hero Health verifies your new payment information and may result in a change to your payment billing date.&nbsp.\nHero Health is not liable for any loss caused by any unauthorized use of your credit card, debit card or any other method of payment by a third party in connection with your use of the Paid Services.&nbsp.\nIF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Change in Amount Authorized</em>.\nIf the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction.\nAny agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.\nYou agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Auto-Renewal for Paid Services</em>.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nAny Paid Services (for example, use of the App and Hero Fill) you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the membership term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate.\nTo change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to account settings.&nbsp.\nIf you terminate a Paid Service within the first year after any 30-day trial period, you will be charged for the remainder of the 12-month period upon termination.\nIf you terminate after the initial 12-month period, you will be charged on a month-to-month basis for the Paid Services, and you may cancel at any time with no penalty.\nPlease see our <strong>Limited Warranty, Returns and Cancellations Policy</strong> for more information.&nbsp.\nIf you do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly basis, you must cancel the applicable Paid Service through your account settings or terminate your HERO HEALTH account before the end of the recurring TERM.\nPaid Services cannot be terminated before the end of the period for which you have already paid, and except as expressly provided in these terms, HERO HEALTH will not refund any fees that you have already paid.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Reaffirmation of Authorization</em>.\nYour non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service.\nWe may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.\nThis does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.\nYour charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Cancellations.&nbsp.\n</em>You can cancel your membership to the Services for any reason if you are dissatisfied with the Services.&nbsp.\nPlease see our

will be stated in the material describing the particular free trial.\nFree trials are for new Hero Health customers only.\nWe may be unable to accommodate combining free trials with any other offers.\nHero Health reserves the right to determine eligibility for any free trial.&nbsp.\nFree trials may require the payment of up-front fees and costs such as activation and shipping charges, some of which may be non-refundable.&nbsp.\nOnce your free trial period ends, we may begin billing your Payment Method for fees corresponding to your membership choices (plus any applicable taxes), unless you cancel prior to the end of your free trial.\nFor that reason, unless otherwise indicated in the free trial description, you may be asked to set up a valid Payment Method when redeeming a free trial offer.\nIf you wish to avoid charges to your Payment Method, you must cancel your membership prior to the last day of your free trial period.\nYou may cancel your membership at any time as

LLC (\u201c<strong>JAMS</strong>\u201d) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.&nbsp.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of

work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(d) <em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>.<strong>&nbsp.\n</strong>YOU AND HERO HEALTH WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.&nbsp.\nYou and Hero Health are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.&nbsp.\nIn any litigation between you and Hero Health over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND HERO HEALTH WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>(e) <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</em>.&nbsp.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES

LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.&nbsp.\nIf however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(f) <em>Opt-out</em>.&nbsp.\nYou have the right to opt

want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>(g) <em>Exclusive Venue</em>.&nbsp.\nIf you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Hero Health to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both you and Hero Health agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, New York County, New York, or the Southern District of New York.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>Miscellaneous</em>.&nbsp.\nYou will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that Hero Health may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.&nbsp.\nThe failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.&nbsp.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.&nbsp.\nYou and Hero Health agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Hero Health, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.&nbsp.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Hero Health, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Hero Health in any respect whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Except as expressly set forth in
