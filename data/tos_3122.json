Arbitration.</strong> Except as provided below OR UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 20.5), any and all Claims between you and EPIX will be resolved in binding arbitration rather than in court.You and EPIX agree to submit to individual binding arbitration for the resolution of any and all Claims by or between you and/or EPIX, except that you and EPIX agree that the following will not be subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in this Section 20.1: (A) any Claim filed by you or EPIX with respect to any violation, enforcement or validity of patent, trademark, trade dress, service mark, copyright and/or trade secret rights of you, EPIX, or any third party, including, but not limited to, Claims related to Postings and/or other content that you upload to or share on the Applications and/or (B) you or EPIX may seek a preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief in any court as provided in Section 21 in connection with any Claim whereby you or EPIX, as applicable, may suffer immediate and irreparable harm for which money damages may be inadequate and impossible to calculate (including, but not limited to, a Claim under Section 20.1(A)), where such Claim under this Section 20.1(B) will not be subject to the informal dispute resolution procedures described in Section 20.2 below.\nprovided, however, that, subsequent to obtaining such preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief, the Claim will then be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 20.\nYou and EPIX agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of Section 20 will be governed by, construed, and enforced, both procedurally and substantively, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\nsections 1\u20139 (<strong>\u201cFAA\u201d</strong>).\nArbitration is the referral of a dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, discovery is more limited than in court, there are no class or representative proceedings, and court review of an arbitration decision is limited.\nAn arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, but not limited to, injunctive and declaratory relief, statutory damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees).\n<strong>\u201cClaim(s)\u201d</strong> means any dispute, claim or controversy by or between you and/or EPIX relating to the Applications and/or this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the Applications\u2019 Privacy Policy and all Additional Terms, Rules, regulations, procedures and policies which we refer to in this Agreement), as may be modified from time-to-time, and the subject matter hereof, including, but not limited to, any contract, tort, statutory, or equity claims.20.2.\n<strong>Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> Except with respect to Claims described in Section 20.1(B) above, before either you or EPIX pursue or participate in any Claim against the other party in arbitration or court proceedings, you or EPIX must notify the other party of the Claim in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating the arbitration or court proceeding in order to provide a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Claim.\nYou may send a written notice of your Claim to EPIX at 260 Madison Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, New York 10016, Attention: Business &amp.\nLegal Affairs.\nEPIX may send written or electronic notice of its Claim to your email address, EPIX account or any physical or other address that you have provided EPIX.\nThe notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail and set forth the relief requested so that the other party has an opportunity to adequately address the Claim.\nExcept with respect to Claims described in Section 20.1(B) above, you and EPIX agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to informally resolve the Claim and, if you and EPIX do not reach an informal resolution of the Claim within 60 days from which such notice is received, then the Claim may be submitted to binding arbitration as set forth in Section 20 or court as permitted by Section 20.1.20.3.\n<strong>Arbitration Proceedings and Costs.</strong> Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>\u201cAAA\u201d</strong>) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the <strong>\u201cAAA Rules\u201d</strong>), as modified by this Agreement.\nThe AAA Rules, and other information about the AAA, are available at the AAA\u2019s website at www.adr.org.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA\u2019s website (see Demand for Arbitration at: https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand%20for%20Arbitration%20Consumer%20Arbitration%20Rules.pdf, but contact the AAA if you have issues accessing these links) and arbitration proceedings shall be initiated in the location described in Section 21.\nAs required by the AAA Rules, if you initiate the arbitration proceedings, you must send the original copy of the completed form to EPIX, which should be sent to EPIX at the following address: 260 Madison Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, New York 10016, Attention: Business &amp.\nLegal Affairs.\nIf your Claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.\nIn all cases, you and EPIX shall exchange documents and other information that you or EPIX intend to use in the arbitration.Upon filing of an arbitration demand for Claims up to $75,000, EPIX will reimburse you for all necessary filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you to the AAA or, if you wish EPIX to pay such fees directly to the AAA, you must request payment of such fees by EPIX by mail to the AAA along with your form initiating arbitration and EPIX will make arrangements to pay such fees directly to the AAA.\nIn the event the arbitrator determines that the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous or vexatious, you agree to reimburse EPIX for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by EPIX on your behalf.\nYou agree that EPIX shall have no obligation to pay any other fees except as determined by the arbitrator.For Claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nThe decision of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.20.4.\n<strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 20.5), YOU AND EPIX AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nYou and EPIX expressly agree that any Claim is personal to you and EPIX, shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration (or individual court proceedings with respect to Claims excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 20.1 of this Agreement), and shall in no event be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding.\nThe arbitrator (or court if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 20.1 of this Agreement) may only conduct an individual arbitration (or court action if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 20.1 of this Agreement), and may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s Claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.\nIf a court or arbitrator determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable in an action between you and EPIX, then this Agreement to arbitrate will be unenforceable.\nNeither you nor EPIX consent to class arbitration.20.5.\n<strong>Right to Opt Out of Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</strong> If you do not wish to be bound by the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provisions in Sections 20.1, 20.3 and 20.4, you must notify EPIX in writing (the <strong>\u201cArbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice\u201d</strong>), where the arbitration/class action waiver opt-out notice meets all of the following requirements:20.5.1.\nSent by first class mail, postage prepaid, certified and return receipt requested or sent by overnight courier service (such as Federal Express)

first and last name, address, phone number, email address and, if applicable, your username if you are a registered user of the EPIX website(s), application(s) or other interactive services(s) along with an identification of the EPIX website(s), application(s) or other interactive services(s) for each such username.\nWe shall use the foregoing information included in the Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice to record, process, maintain and administer your opt-out of the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provisions and not for marketing purposes.20.5.4.\nIncludes a statement that you do not agree to the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver.If the Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice meets all of the above requirements, you will be deemed to

services.\nNote that a valid Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice applies only to the individual identified in such notice as opting out.If the Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice does not meet all of the above requirements, you will not be deemed to have opted out of the mandatory arbitration and class action waiver provisions in Section 20.1, Section 20.3 and Section 20.4.21.\nGoverning Law, Arbitration Location, Jurisdiction, Venue and Jury Trial Waiver.With the exception of the provision above that the enforceability of Section 20 is governed both procedurally and substantively by the FAA, this Agreement and your use of the Applications is otherwise governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to that state\u2019s choice or conflict of laws rules).You or EPIX shall initiate arbitration in the United States county or territory in which you reside or, if you do not reside in the United States or one of its territories, in the non-United States country in which you reside.\nprovided, however, that (a) EPIX may request to transfer the arbitration to New York County, New York if it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location as such additional fees or costs are determined by the arbitrator and to the maximum extent permitted by law, and, upon such request, (b)(i) if you agree to such request, the arbitration shall be transferred to New York County, New York or (ii) if you do not agree to such request, EPIX shall have right to request that the arbitrator determine the location in which the arbitration shall be held.\nYou and EPIX agree that any Claim that is allowed to proceed in court as set forth in Section 20.1 of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, as a result of your submission of a valid Arbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice), or otherwise proceeds in court in the event the agreement to arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or a particular Claim as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, is subject to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the State or Federal Courts situated in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, State of New York, and you expressly consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.To the extent it may be applicable, you and EPIX agree to opt out from and expressly exclude any applicability of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.<strong>If any Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, YOU AND EPIX WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</strong>22.\nMiscellaneousWhen you visit the Applications or send e-mails to us, you are communicating with us electronically.\nYou consent to receive communications from us electronically.\nWe

choices regarding the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls for the Internet browser as described in the \u201cMore Information About Cookie Controls\u201d section below.\nPlease note that using those controls may affect Tracking Technologies that are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.See the \u201cMore Information on Managing Tracking Technologies\u201d section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and for information on your choices regarding Identifiers on mobile platforms.5.2.2.\nTracking Technologies Set By the Applications.\nWith respect to the Tracking

may prevent or exercise choices regarding browser cookies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls described in the following:<ul>\n<li>Internet Explorer 11</li>\n<li>Chrome</li>\n<li>Safari</li>\n<li>Firefox</li>\n</ul>If your Internet browser is not listed above or you otherwise are having difficulties with the links, you may be able to access controls to:<ul>\n<li>Delete existing browser cookies through the \u201cInternet Options\u201d, \u201cSettings\u201d, Preferences\u201d, \u201cOptions\u201d, or similar menu selection in your browser\u2019s menu or otherwise as directed by your browser\u2019s support feature, which means that all pre-existing browser cookies are deleted but does not prevent browser cookies from being used in the future.</li>\n<li>Disable browser cookies through the same browser controls, which means that browser cookies shall not be used in the future but pre-existing browser cookies may not be deleted.\nAdditional information on enabling or disabling browser cookies and other Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser\u2019s support feature.\n(See the \u201chelp\u201d section of your browser for more information.) Disabling may sometimes be referred to as blocking or opting out of browser cookies and relies on browser cookies to remember your choices.</li>\n<li>If you delete browser cookies using the controls in your Web browser (as described above) after disabling browser cookies, you may have to disable browser cookies again to re-establish your preferences.</li>\n<li>Choose to have the Device you use to access the Applications warn you each time a browser cookie or certain other non-Flash LSO Tracking Technology is being set.\n(You can later choose to turn-off such warnings.) This may be available through your Internet browser on the Device you use to access the Applications.\nAdditional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser\u2019s support feature.</li>\n<li>Seek additional information from the provider of your Internet browser through your browser\u2019s support features.</li>\n</ul>The above options may cover

browser, after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to reestablish your preferences and, if you exercise opt-outs through the mechanisms described above, and then delete or block browser cookies, you may need to exercise your opt-outs through these mechanisms again.The tools are \u201cInternet browser and Device-specific\u201d or \u201cDevice-specific\u201d.\nNote that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device and not across Devices and platforms.5.2.3.2.\nAutomatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.\nSome Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications, or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the
