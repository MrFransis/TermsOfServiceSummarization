Academic Research and Informed Consent.\n&nbsp;Arizona State University\u2019s Center for Engagement and Training in Science and Society and SciStarter, in partnership with select citizen science projects, are conducting a research study to inform the design and implementation of online functions to help citizen scientists more easily find and get involved in projects and to track contributions to projects.\nIn doing so, we will research and refine development of SciStarter, to foster productive collaborations among citizen scientists and project managers.\nThe research study aims to improve our understanding of advantages and disadvantages of design components of the SciStarter platform based on user experiences by citizen scientists and project owners.\n&nbsp;Any reports based on visitors' and account holders' online activites are shared in aggregate and data are not linked to any personally identifyable information.\nData collected for this research may involve an examination of how you use SciStarter, solicitation of your experiences with different features of SciStarter, and the collection of some demographic information that will be shared with owners of the citizen science projects in which you participate, only with your explicit permission.\nDetails are available on the SciStarter Privacy Policy page.\n&nbsp;As part of research funded by the National Science Foundation for the development of SciStarter, we will also work with other researchers to examine the online patterns of how users navigate the site, search for and bookmark projects, join and display projects, and communicate with project leaders and other citizen scientists.\nThis research helps us better understand citizen scientists and improve the design of SciStarter accordingly.\nBy joining SciStarter, you are consenting to participate in this research.\nYour activity in SciStarter and all information you provide will be kept confidential (not linked to personally identifiable information) in all reports and publications, unless you explicitly agree to share your identity, but may be shared with the owners of citizen science projects in which you enroll.\nIf you have
