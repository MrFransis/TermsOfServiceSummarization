effect which requires certain retailers and manufacturers doing business in California to publicly disclose their efforts, if any, to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.</p>\n<p>We do not use any forced labor in our operations and we expect the same of our business partners and suppliers.&nbsp.\nAccordingly, all of our employees are charged with identifying and working with reputable suppliers that are committed to complying with all federal, state, and foreign laws regarding labor practices.</p>\n<p>When we source from suppliers, we typically do so from suppliers located in the United States, and we typically do not engage suppliers from countries with an increased risk of human trafficking and slavery.\nWe monitor supplier behavior and compliance to ensure that our suppliers meet our high standards.&nbsp.\nIt is our policy to cease doing business with any supplier who participates in human trafficking or forced labor practices.\nIf we discover a concern with one of our suppliers, we may require appropriate corrective action or terminate the relationship.</p>\n<p>We have and are continuing to educate our employees who are involved in the procurement of goods and services about the Transparency in Supply Chains Act to guard against any use of forced labor in our supply chains.</p>\n<p>\u00a9 2018&nbsp;<strong>Brown-Forman
