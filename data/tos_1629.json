Sure, another member just tested all of the codes with Honey five minutes ago.\nWant to see when a product you\u2019re interested in goes on sale? Another Honey member is helping us update the price right now.\nWhen shoppers hunt for deals together, rather than on their own, everyone saves time and money.<br>\n<br> Our stance on privacy is simple: We will be transparent with what data we collect and how we use it to save you time and money, and you can decide if you\u2019re good with that.<br>\n<br> If this sounds fair, then let\u2019s start shopping smarter, together.<br>\n<br> P.S.\nIf you have any questions or comments, just email us at privacy@joinhoney.com.\nGeorge RuanCo-FounderRyan HudsonCo-FounderIntroducing the Privacy Policy This privacy policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) explains how Honey Science LLC (\u201cHoney\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) collects and processes information from members and users of the website, software applications, and other online services we provide (collectively \u201cHoney\u2019s products\u201d).\nHoney\u2019s products include, but are not limited to, the Honey extension for web browsers (the \u201cExtension\u201d), the Honey mobile application (the \u201cMobile App\u201d), and the website located at www.joinhoney.com (the \u201cWebsite\u201d).<br>\n<br> If we ever need additional personal information for a specific reason, we will tell you and ask for your permission.\nAlso, to the extent that Honey has links to other websites (like retailers), please note that we do not own, operate, or control them, and they have their own controlling privacy policies that you should review.\nWhat data we collect and why In order to provide our products, Honey collects information that you share directly with us when you use our website, extension, or Mobile App.\nThough you don\u2019t have to, you can choose to provide your email to set up an account with us, which lets you add items to your Droplist, earn Honey Gold, see a personalized recommendation feed, and more.\nYou can also set up your profile with your name and other info for a more personalized experience.<br>\n<br> Honey also collects technical information about your device and use of Honey to make sure that our products are working correctly.\nThe information we collect is geared to providing Honey members with a better way to shop online and to help us develop, improve, and market our services.\nLearn More&nbsp;Honey does not track your search engine history, emails, or your browsing on any site that is not a retail website (a site where you can shop and make a purchase).\nWhen you are on a pre-approved retail site, to help you save money, Honey will collect information about that site that lets us know which coupons and promos to find for you.\nWe may also collect information about pricing and availability of items, which we can share with the rest of the Honey community.Learn More&nbsp;How we share your dataWe know how important your personal data is to you, so we will never sell it.\nWe\u2019ll only share it with your consent or in ways you\u2019d expect (as we explain here).\nThat means we will share your data if needed to complete your purchase, with businesses who help us operate Honey, or if we are legally required to do so.Learn More&nbsp;How we protect your dataThe security of your information is important to us.\nWe have a team dedicated to protecting your information and have put in place physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards.Learn More&nbsp;How we use cookies and similar technologiesLike most other online services, Honey uses cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other markers (we\u2019ll just call them \u201ccookies\u201d) to collect some of the data discussed in this Privacy Policy.\nThese help us operate our products, analyze engagement and usage, and provide a relevant and personalized shopping experience.\nSee below to learn how you can manage your cookie preferences.Learn More&nbsp;Your choices for managing your dataWe\u2019ve made it easy to opt out of Honey\u2019s products at any time.Learn More&nbsp;Additional rights regarding your dataDepending on where you live, you may have additional rights as to the personal information that you share and Honey collects.\nResidents of

information to us.Learn More&nbsp;Changes to this policyWe will continue to update our policies and practices as needed.\nWe will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting any changes
