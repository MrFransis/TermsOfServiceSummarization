<p>Last modified: May 16, 2018</p>\n<p>This cookie policy (\u201cCookie Policy\u201c) describes the use of Cookies (as defined below) by AlienVault, Inc.\nand its respective subsidiaries (\u201cAlienVault,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour,\u201d if not explicitly referring to one company).</p>\n<p>Please remember that your use of the Sites is at all times subject to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which incorporates this Cookie Policy.\nAny terms we use in this Cookie Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.</p> HOW ALIENVAULT USES COOKIES <p>The Sites use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, JavaScript, and local storage.\nCookies are small files \u2013 usually consisting of letters and numbers \u2013 placed on Your Device, when you use that device to visit a Site.\nWe will refer to cookies and similar technologies simply as \u201c<b>Cookies</b>\u201d for the remainder of this Cookie Policy.\nWe use Cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and otherwise use the Sites through the internet, to analyze trends, and to learn about our user base.</p>\n<p>We may combine non-personally identifiable information collected through Cookies with other Personal Information that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account.\nWe may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties in order to enhance our Sites, or to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you.\nWhere we use Cookies to collect information that is personally identifiable, or that can become personally identifiable if we combine it with other information, the AlienVault Privacy Policy will apply in addition to this Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>You can control and/or delete Cookies as you wish \u2013 for details, see www.aboutcookies.org.\nMost browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.\nYou can delete all Cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed.\nIf you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.\nWe strongly recommend that you leave Cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Sites.</p>\n<p>Further information on Cookies can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/ipg/basics/legal/cookies/index_en.htm</p>\n<p>Please reference the chart and general description below to learn more about the kinds of cookies we use and for what purpose.</p>

on your Device varies from Cookie to Cookie.\nWe use Persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Sites, how often you return, how your use of the Sites may vary over time, and measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts.\nYour browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d
