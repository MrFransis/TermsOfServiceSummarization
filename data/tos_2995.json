with whom it is being shared.\n\u2013 See more at http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/</p>\n<p>According to&nbsp;CalOPPA, we agree to the

that protect personal information.</p>\n<p>To&nbsp;be in line with Fair Information Practices we will&nbsp;notify you via email within 7 business days&nbsp;should a data breach occur.&nbsp;We also

prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CAN-SPAM</strong>\n<strong> Act&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes
