all\u201d.\nWe have some very basic rules that constitute acceptable use of our services.\nThis helps us maintain a quality service that can be enjoyed by all.\nThe first section covers our <u>Acceptable Usage Policy</u> (AUP), which states what sort of things we do not allow.\nThat is then followed by our <u>Terms Of Service</u>.\nAre you looking for our Privacy Policy? That can be found on it's own page <u>here</u>.</p>\n<p>By using our service you accept and agree to the following policies.\nPlease contact us if you have any questions or conncerns.</p>\n<p>Last Updated: 01/23/2020</p> The following is NOT permitted.\n<p>\n<b>Resource Abuse:</b>\n</p>\n<p>This is any activity, intentional or otherwise, that consumes an abundance of system resources that negatively impacts of the quality of the service for other customers.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We will respond to resource abuse by suspending the account in question and reaching out to you for a solution.\nWe will work with you if this is happening unintentionally and help you resolve the issue.\nIf we discover an intentional abuse of resources then your service will remain suspended until you\u2019re able to retrieve a backup of your data, which we supply you, so that you may move your ill-intentions elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Unsolicited Communication:</b>\n</p>\n<p>Spamming is the use of messaging systems to send an unsolicited message (spam) to large numbers of recipients for the purpose of commercial advertising, for the purpose of non-commercial proselytizing, or for any prohibited purpose (especially the fraudulent purpose of phishing).</p>\n<br>\n<p>The use of our services for spamming is strictly prohibited.\nAny customer discovered to be sending spam, intentional or otherwise, will have their service suspended without notice until we are able to reach you for a solution.\nIf discovered that the spamming is intentional, your service will remain suspended until you\u2019re able to retrieve a backup of your data, which we supply you, so that you may move your ill-intentions elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Malicious Content:</b>\n</p>\n<p>This will be defined as any script, code, or file that performs a harmful action, either to the user(s) affected or as a bulk action triggered by the user.\nThis, for the sake of ease, will be any content, code, network activity or script that would violate the laws of the United States.\nThis includes but is not limited to phishing sites, participating in DdoS or other network related attacks, using our services to attempt to gain unlawful access into networks, devices, or systems that you have no authority to gain access to, etc.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Any account found to purposely be participating in the above actions will be suspended without notice, until we are able to reach you to determine if this was unintentional or intentional actions from your account.\nIf unintentional, we will work with you to resolve the problem.\nIf found to be intentional, your service will remain suspended until you\u2019re able to retrieve a backup of your data, which we will supply you, so that you may move your ill-intentions elsewhere.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Content Depicting Minors Sexually:</b>\n</p>\n<p>Hosting, sharing or making available any images, video, or other media that depicts minors sexually (nude or non-nude) is strictly forbidden.\nAny account found to be in violation of this will be immediately suspended.\nIf this is discovered to unintentional, we will advise you to remove the content immediately.\nIf it\u2019s found to be intentional, your service will be terminated and your data removed from our servers.\nWe will not be put in a position where we are held liable for content such as that, and have no obligation to supply you with a backup of your data if in violation of the above rule.</p>\n<p>Legal adult content is fine.\nIf faced with a situation where the legality is questionable, we will err on the side of caution and advise that it be removed.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Illegal Marketplaces:</b>\n</p>\n<p>Although we\u2019re pretty libertarian, we can not in good faith knowingly allow our services to be used to host online marketplaces that deal in illegal goods or services.\nYou may link to them, you may review them, you may talk about them, you can do many things in regards to illegal marketplaces except host one yourself.\nAn illegal marketplace will be defined as any website allowing users and vendors to sign up to advertise and to purchase the sell of goods and services that would be determined to be illegal in practically every country on earth.\n(Drugs, weapons, fake IDs, stolen credit card information, etc)</p> Terms Of Service <p>By using our service(s), you agree to the below terms.\nWe believe that these terms are more than reasonable and hope that you find them reasonable, too.</p> Use of our Services <ul>\n<li>Content hosted on our network should abide by both our Acceptable Usage Policy as well as the laws of your home country.</li>\n<br>\n<li>You are responsible for the content that is available under your account with us.\nIf hosting a website that

terminate your account.</li>\n<br>\n<li>You are responsible for backing up your own data.\nWhile we do maintain a level of storage redundancy, we do not offer offsite backups at this time and do not archive your web hosting content off-site or elsewhere.</li>\n<br>\n</ul> Conditions Of Use <ul>\n<li>You agree to abide by our Acceptable Usage Policy and understand that accidentally or purposefully violating our AUP may result in account suspension or termination without compensation depending on severity.</li>\n<br>\n</ul> Account Registration <ul>\n<li>We do not verify the legitimacy of the details you supply when signing up when paying with crypto.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Clients should provide a legitimate point-of-contact (Email preferred) so that we may contact you as needed for invoicing and service related needs.\nIt is your responsibility to make sure your point of contact is reliable.\nAny account with an overdue balance (see billing info below) can/will be suspended and may be terminated for non-payment.\nWe will also terminate any account after a long period of non-reachability when suspended for AUP violations.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Accounts paying with PayPal or Credit Cards will require additional verification and will require legitimate, personal identifying information to be reviewed to determine that your order is not fraudulent.</li>\n<br>\n</ul> Billing / Invoices / Payments <ul>\n<li>We prefer that you pay for your services with cryptocurrencies, though you are free to pay via traditional methods as well.\nPlease contact us if you have any questions.\nWe accept

date.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Any account more than 5 days overdue will be suspended for non-payment.\n(Please contact us if you need more time.\nWe\u2019re human and we understand that you may be late on payment.)</li>\n<br>\n<li>Any account more than 15 days overdue will simply be terminated.\nThis includes removal of your data, any generated domain(s) and/or their key files.\nAfter deletion it will not be possible to recover any of this data.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Traditional Payment Methods such as paying with PayPal or Credit Card will require additional information and verifiable, legitimate information provided to us so that we may protect ourselves against fraud and the increased risk of fraudulent charge backs.\nWe reserve the right to refuse service to anyone who fails to comply.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Accounts suspended or terminated due to policy violations will not be considered eligible for refunds.\nCancellation of services by the customer will result in a pro-rated refund for the unused service time within 30 days of cancellation.</li>\n<br>\n</ul> Service Processing <ul>\n<li>After payment for service has been received, your order will be processed manually and you will be supplied with the information needed to start accessing your service from your supplied point of contact within 24 hours (typically, much faster).</li>\n<br>\n<li>Orders that remain unpaid for more than 24 hours will be deleted.\nYou will need to initiate the order process to continue with an order after that time.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Service downgrades will result in pro-rated refund for the difference in cost to be applied as service credit.\nService upgrades may be delayed depending on available resources / capacity / stock of the service in question.\nAny previous outstanding invoice must be paid in full before service upgrades/downgrades can take place.</li>\n<br>\n</ul> Generated Domain Key Files <ul>\n<li>The files associated with your I2P and Tor .onion domain names are stored outside of your user directory to prevent accidental deletion and/or modification which would render your domain(s) inoperable.</li>\n<br>\n<li>The domain key file(s) that we generate for your Tor Onion and I2P hosting will be given to you upon request.</li>\n<br>\n<li>Canceled or terminated accounts will have their domain key(s) removed from our servers as a privacy measure.\nIf you will need these keys to host your site(s) elsewhere, please make the request for them before cancellation, suspension for non-payment, etc.</li>\n<br>\n</ul> Business Hours <p>We are unofficially available 24/7, meaning that we are a small team on various sleep schedules with the ability to respond to most questions/concerns within 8-12 hours, often times much faster.\nWe do not offer any
