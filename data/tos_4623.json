- so make sure your details are always up to date.\nIf in doubt, these Terms are concluded in English.</p>\n<b>What are these Terms?</b>\n<p>These <b>Terms</b> set out the terms of service for your Curve account and other important things you need to know.\nBy clicking \u201caccept/continue\u201d you\u2019re entering into a legally binding agreement with&nbsp.\n<b>Curve OS Limited</b>, which issues your Curve card and electronic money (e-money).\nCurve is authorised to issue e-money by the Financial Conduct Authority (firm reference number 900926).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can always download a set of the most recent Terms from our website and when we need to make changes to these terms - we will send you a copy of the new Terms on email.</p>\n<b>Anything else you should read?</b>\n<p>The Fee Schedule forms part of these Terms and we highly recommend reading it.\nAlong with these Terms, you should take a look at our <b>Privacy Policy</b>, <b>Cookie Policy</b>, <b>Fair Use Policy</b>, <b>Curve Customer Protection</b> Policy and refer to the FAQs for any questions you may have.</p>\n<b>Who can open a Curve account?</b>\n<p>You can open a Curve account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>if you\u2019re a resident in the United Kingdom,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>have the full legal capacity to enter into a contract, and&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you\u2019re 18 years old or over.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can\u2019t open a Curve account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>on someone else\u2019s behalf, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if you already have a Curve account, or&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if there is any reason that Curve is unable to grant you an account under the law that applies to us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may ask you for additional information, from time to time,&nbsp.\nwhen you are opening your account or at a later stage, and if this information does not meet our requirements - this may result in your account opening being delayed or rejected or even suspension or closure of your account once opened.</p>\n<b>What should you know about your Curve account?</b>\n<p>\n<b>E-money.\n</b>Your Curve account stores e-money, an electronic alternative to cash that can be used to pay for goods and services, in store or online and to take money out at an ATM.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the <b>Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) does not apply</b> to e-money accounts, rest assured that your money is always kept separate from our own.\nThis is known as safeguarding.\nIt is required by law and ensures that your money is protected and returned to you in full if we decide to cease operations.\nHowever, if we were to become insolvent then the funds returned to you may be less than the total in your account, as the costs to arrange repayment,and the costs of the administrators who would coordinate the return of customer funds, may be deducted from the funds owed to you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>No interest.\n</b>We\u2019re not allowed to pay you interest on the funds we hold for you..&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>How it works</b>.\nYou need to link and verify an eligible payment card to your Curve account in the Curve app, before you can use your Curve card.\nThe payment card can be any debit card, credit card or prepaid card that we allow you to link to your Curve account.\nWe may need to introduce certain restrictions on the cards that we are able to accept on to the Curve system and will try to keep you informed on any changes, some of which may depend on the card schemes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you make a transaction using your Curve card, Curve (with your permission) loads funds from your selected payment card to Curve, this is done for you automatically by the Curve processing system (no hassle to you).\nThe amount loaded will be the value of the transaction, plus any fees for that transaction (including for any Curve services provided).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The loaded funds are used to issue e-money, which is loaded onto your Curve e-money account and is then used to pay for the transaction made with your Curve card.\nIf your selected payment card account has insufficient funds or declines the transaction for any other reason, the transaction will&nbsp.\nbe declined.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In case Curve receives a decline from the payment card selected in the Curve app, we may try to process the transaction from the cards that you have set as your default or back up cards (for more information on how to set this up, go here).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can add multiple payment cards to the Curve app and change the selected payment card at any time using the Curve app.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each time you link a payment card to your Curve account you\u2019re giving us a continuous authority to use that payment card to fund the purchase of the e-money used to pay for transactions.\nCurve will use <b>various means to identify</b> that the card you have added to your account is yours and that you have the right to use it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can see your transactions on the timeline in the Curve app.</p>\n<b>What should you know about your Curve card?</b>\n<p>Curve will issue you either a personal or business Curve Card.\nIt will either be a physical and/or digital card.\nA digital card is a card where you can see your Curve card details in the Curve app only, and can request a physical card if you want one (fees for this are in the Fee Schedule).</p>\n<p>You can use your Curve card to make purchases for goods and services, in store or online.\nTo withdraw cash, you will need a physical Curve card.\nPlease note that you cannot withdraw cash at an ATM if you have your Curve Cash card selected as a funding source for the Curve card.</p>\n<b>ACCOUNTS &amp.\nSECURITY</b>\n<b>What type of accounts can you open?</b>\n<p>\n<b>Personal or business.\n</b>Curve offers both personal and business accounts.\nYou can only open a business account if you are a sole-trader or a self-employed natural person and intend to use your Curve account exclusively for business spend.\nYou cannot open a business account for a company or partnership.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We can suspend your account or change it from business to personal if we reasonably think&nbsp.\nit is not being used for business purposes.\nIf we change your account type, we will issue you with a replacement card.\nFrom time to time, we may request further information from you to verify your business status and business spend.\nPlease note that the use of a Curve business account for personal spend is not permitted under these Terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have a business account but wish to use Curve for personal reasons, you must contact us to change your account type.\nThere is no cost to you for this change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Accounts.\n</b>We offer accounts with different levels of services and fees:</p>\n<b>Curve Blue</b>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Blue benefits</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Subscription Fees: </b>None Check out the Fee Schedule for full details.</p>\n<b>Curve Black</b>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Black benefits</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Subscription Fees: </b>GBP 9.99 monthly - check out the Fee Schedule for full details.</p>\n<b>Curve Metal</b>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Metal benefits</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Subscription Fees: </b>GBP 14.99 monthly or GBP 150 annually - check out the Fee Schedule for full details.</p>\n<b>Curve Black Legacy (for Curve Black customer who signed up before 28 Jan 2019 and elected to stay on)</b>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Black Legacy benefits</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Subscription Fees: </b>No subscription fees.\nFor all other fees, check under the Curve Black section of the Fee Schedule</p>\n<p>\n<b>Minimum subscription periods</b>\n</p>\n<p>When you subscribe to Curve Black or Metal, you can choose to pay monthly or annually.\nDepending on which you choose, minimum subscription periods apply.</p>\n<p>\n<b>If you choose to pay monthly</b>, the minimum subscription period is 6 months.\nIf you wish to cancel your subscription you may do so but you will not be refunded any amount paid for the current month of the subscription.\nIf you cancel your subscription and it is less than 4 months since the start of it, you must give us 2 months\u2019 advance notice (such notice period to run from the end of your current subscription month).\nYou do not need to give us advance notice if you want to cancel and it is more than 4 months since the start of it.</p>\n<p>\n<b>If you choose to pay annually</b>, the minimum subscription period is 12 months.\nThis minimum subscription period will apply each time your subscription is renewed.\nIf you wish to cancel your subscription you may do so but you will not be refunded any amount of the annual subscription fee.\nYou do not need to give us advance notice to cancel your subscription.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In all cases where your subscription is subject to a minimum subscription period (whether 6 months because you pay monthly or 12 months because you pay annually), you will continue to have all of the benefits available under those subscriptions until the end of the period for which you have paid.\nFor example, if you cancel your 12 month subscription during its second month, you can continue to use the benefits under the subscription for the remaining 10 months.</p>\n<p>If you were an existing Curve Black or Metal subscriber at the time version 2.1 of these Terms was published (29 April 2021), the minimum subscription periods detailed above will not apply to you for so long as you continue on your current subscription (this includes annual subscribers when their subscription renews).\nIf you upgrade from Black to Metal or downgrade from Metal to Black or change your subscription payment schedule from monthly to annually or annually to monthly, the minimum subscription periods will apply.</p>\n<p>\n<b>More than one account.\n</b>You can not hold more than one Curve account.\nWe can close down additional accounts without informing you first.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Upgrading your account.\n</b>You can upgrade your account simply by clicking on the \u2018Manage Your Subscription\u2019 tab in the app.\nYou can also change the payment card your subscription is charged to using the same tab.</p>\n<p>If we can\u2019t charge your nominated payment card for subscription fees or any other fees you owe us - e.g., if your card has expired or has insufficient funds - you agree that we can take them from any other payment card you\u2019ve linked to your Curve account.\nIf we can\u2019t take the fees from any of the other payment cards either, you\u2019ll need to provide us with a valid payment card within 30 days of our request to do so, otherwise we may either close or downgrade your account.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Downgrading your account.\n</b>You can downgrade your account by getting in touch with us and fees may be payable in accordance with the Fee Schedule.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Curve reserves the right to restrict the ability to subscribe to the Curve Metal or Curve Black account for customers who upgrade or downgrade from another type of Account, more than once in a given 12 month period.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Fees.</b> You can find details of the fees we charge in the Fee Schedule.\nWe will keep you informed before we introduce any new fee or make changes to any existing fees.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Replacement Card.</b> We charge fees for replacing your&nbsp.\nCurve card at the time we process the request for a replacement card.\nWe can charge the fee from any of the payment cards linked to your Curve account.\nWe won\u2019t charge you to replace a card that has been stolen or misappropriated.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Fronted.</b> Using your Curve card (with a debit or credit card as your payment card) to pay merchants who only accept payments by debit card, or who either impose a charge or deny certain types of debit or credit cards <b>(e.g.\ntransactions to the HM Revenue and Customs in the UK, paying off a credit card with an underlying credit card selected)</b>, is defined by Curve as a Curve Fronted transaction and will attract a service fee (see our Fees Schedule for details).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please remember that when you fund your Curve card with a credit card or other card that applies fees to transactions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your underlying credit card issuer may also apply fees in relation to Curve Fronted transactions using Curve.\nCurve will not be liable for such fees.\nThese fees are strictly non-refundable in nature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may have to pay other costs, taxes, or charges which are outside our control and not charged by us e.g.\nyour payment card issuer may charge you for making a payment through your Curve card.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Keeping your account safe</b>\n<p>Please keep your Curve card, account information, security details and the devices you use to access your account safe.\nThis means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>signing your Curve card as soon as you receive it (if you can)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>not sharing your security details with anyone (including your Curve card PIN, Curve app password or PIN or other security information used to protect your Curve account)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>not letting anyone else use your Curve card or Curve app&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>keeping your Curve card and card details (physical or digital) safe</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>keeping your mobile phone and your email account secure.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think your card is lost or stolen, someone knows your security details or there are transactions on your account you don\u2019t recognise, you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>immediately lock your Curve card in the app</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>let us know ASAP by calling +44(0)2033222585 (lines are open 24/7), by email on <b>support@curve.com</b> or via the Curve app</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>stop using your Curve account and card until you hear from us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you find your Curve card after you\u2019ve locked it but before you\u2019ve notified us, simply unlock it again via the app.</p>\n<p>Because we send important notifications and information to you via the Curve app and the proper functioning and security of the app relies on updates from time to time, you agree that you will keep the Curve app on your mobile devices up to date.</p>\n<b>USING CURVE</b>\n<b>Using your Curve card</b>\n<p>\n<b>Uses.\n</b>You<b>\n</b>can use your Curve card to make payments or withdraw cash.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Authorised transactions.\n</b>We\u2019ll consider a transaction to be authorised by you when you do at least one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>enter your PIN</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>sign a receipt</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>provide your Curve card details (card number, expiry date, CVV number)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>wave or swipe your Curve card (digital or physical) over or near a contactless payment reader</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>use your Curve card and PIN to withdraw cash from a payment terminal, e.g at ATM</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>select a contact of yours and instruct the transfer of funds to that person in the Curve app.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typically your authorisation for a transaction lasts for 30 days.\nIf a merchant processes your transaction after 30 days, you agree that we can still process the transaction.\nYou remain responsible under these Terms in respect of all transactions you authorise on your Curve account including all charges and other amounts incurred.\nYou also agree that if Curve is unable to collect the corresponding funds from your funding card at time these become due to be paid by Curve to the merchant, Curve is authorised to collect such funds from any of your other funding cards loaded into the Curve app.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cancelling transactions.\n</b>You can cancel a transaction you\u2019ve agreed to pay in the future up until close of business on the day before the transaction is due to take place.\nJust contact us to do this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Changes to payment amounts.\n</b>Sometimes, you might make changes to a purchase between the time you authorise the transaction and the time the merchant processes it.\nIn these cases, the merchant may amend the payment amount to reflect this change.\nYou agree that we may pay the additional amount to the merchant on the basis of your initial authorisation and charge the shortfall to you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Pre-authorisations.\n</b>If you\u2019ve used your card to pre-authorise a transaction of less than \u00a3150 (or its equivalent in your local currency if you are using a non-UK funding card), we may place a block on those funds (meaning you can\u2019t use them) or charge the amount to your payment card at the time you pre-authorise the transaction.\nIf the final amount is less than \u00a3150, we\u2019ll refund or unblock the difference.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Continuous payment authority</b>.\nYou can use your Curve card to set up a future payment (either on a one-off or recurring basis) on a selected payment card.\nWe\u2019ll make the payment from the payment card you\u2019ve selected in the Curve App at the time we process the transaction, which may be a different payment card to the one you had selected at the time you set up the future payment.\nIf you need to cancel such payments, get in touch with us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Spending limits.</b> We have limits on how much you can spend or withdraw - these are set out in your Curve app.\nWe may change these limits every now and then.\nYou can ask us to increase your limits - if we refuse, you have to wait 3 months to request another review.</p>\n<b>Reasons we may refuse or delay a payment?</b>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Security: </b>We\u2019re concerned about the security of your Curve card or account,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Fraud: </b>We suspect fraud on your account,&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Law or regulation: </b>We need to comply with the relevant law or regulation,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Your actions: </b>The transaction breaches limits which apply to your Curve account, you\u2019ve breached these Terms, you\u2019ve failed to provide us with information we\u2019ve asked for, or your account has been blocked for any other legitimate reason, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Third parties: </b>If a third party (e.g.\na card network) prevents us from making the payment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll tell you if we refuse to make a payment and (where possible) why.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may need to contact you urgently if we suspect or find fraudulent activity has occurred on your account (provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law) or if we suffer a security threat.\nWhen we contact you, we will also give you information on how you can minimise any risk to your payment instrument depending on the nature of the fraud or security threat.\nWe\u2019ll use the same contact details which you have already provided us with when contacting you.\nso please make sure you keep your account details up to date by contacting us.</p>\n<b>What about foreign currency transactions?</b>\n<p>In case of withdrawals or purchases using your Curve card where the currency of your selected payment card is different to the currency of the transaction - Curve will perform a currency conversion for you.</p>\n<p>If, when making a transaction, you have set your payment card currency in the Curve app to a different currency than that of the payment card itself then your payment card issuer may charge a fee for using their currency conversion services.\nThis might be in addition to any fees that Curve charges you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If we have to convert the currency of a payment made using your Curve card we\u2019ll use an exchange rate which will be either the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Standard exchange rate.</b> On a weekday we will normally use an exchange rate collected from our wholesale provider, though when the exchange rate is volatile we may use the rate as of midnight on that day.\nWe\u2019ll use this rate during the hours foreign currency markets are open in the UK.\nWe can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Weekend exchange rate</b>.\nThis is the rate at the time the markets are closed in London, UK.\nIt will apply from the time the markets close until they open again.\n.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Exchange rates can fluctuate between the date you made the transaction and the date it\u2019s actually processed by the merchant to your account, please note that changes in the exchange rates will be applied immediately and without notice..\nThe rate applied to a transaction will be shown in the Curve app..&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you use the Go Back in Time feature in relation to a foreign currency transaction, it\u2019s possible that a different exchange rate to the one used for the original transaction will apply.\nIf the merchant subsequently refunds the foreign transaction payment, the exchange rate used will be the one at the date the transaction was settled, not when the refund is settled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can contact us at support@curve.com for details of the exchange rate for any transaction.\nYou can also find the exchange rate that was applied to your transaction in your Curve app.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll not be responsible to you if you\u2019re charged fees or lose any money if you ask the merchant or any other third party to make the currency conversion.&nbsp;</p>\n<b>Who\u2019s responsible for losses on your Curve card or account?</b>\n<p>\n<b>When you\u2019ll be responsible.&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>You\u2019re responsible for all losses where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>you\u2019ve acted fraudulently</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you deliberately failed to keep your device, account details or your Curve card and account security details safe.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don\u2019t tell us as soon as you realise that your card is lost or stolen, when you think or suspect that someone else knows your security details, or there have been unauthorised transactions on your Curve card, you\u2019ll have to pay up to \u00a335 of the losses.</p>\n<p>\n<b>When we\u2019ll be responsible.\n</b>We\u2019ll refund you any money you\u2019ve lost as a result of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>any unauthorised transaction which you\u2019ve promptly reported (and within 13 months of the transaction), provided you\u2019ve not acted fraudulently or carelessly,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>our mistakes, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>transactions authorised by us after you locked your card (but only to the amount of the original authorisation).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also refund you where you\u2019ve used your Curve card to make a payment within the UK without knowing the exact amount beforehand (e.g.\nwhen hiring a car) and the final amount is much higher than you reasonably would have expected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just drop us a line through the app or at support@curve.com within 8 weeks of the transaction and provide us with any further information we need to look into this.\nWe\u2019ll then make a decision either to refund the transaction or give you reasons for rejecting your request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<b>What can I not use my Curve account and Curve card for?</b>\n<p>We know most customers will but you must use your Curve account and card responsibly.\nYou can\u2019t use them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>for anything that\u2019s against the law (e.g.\nfraud) or is harmful or disrespectful to others, including any form of abuse of us or our staff</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in breach of these Terms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in a way that might harm our ability to provide our services or may harm our software, systems or hardware</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in a way that your payment card issuer, a card network, our acquirer and/ or payment processor, would see as an abuse of the payments system;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to pay for adult entertainment, gambling, cryptocurrencies, money orders (except wire transfers) and travellers cheques from non-financial institutions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for \u201ccash recycling\u201d, which means using your Curve card to make an ATM withdrawal and using the cash to repay the payment card used for the withdrawal in order to receive rewards on the payment card or your Curve card</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to create one or more Curve account(s) without our permission</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>attempt to \u201cdouble dip\u201d or to do anything during the course of a dispute to receive funds from us and your bank or payment card issuer for the same transaction</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to make transactions which are not allowed by the issuer of your linked payment card&nbsp.\ne.g.\ncash advances or transactions for investment purposes.\nCheck your payment card\u2019s terms to see what\u2019s allowed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Money owed to Curve</b>\n<p>In the event you owe Curve money either for fees or transactions that you have made using Curve, or missed subscription fees, we may immediately charge such amounts to any of your payment cards.\nWe reserve the right to collect the amount of your debt to Curve by using any payments received to your Account.\nWe may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency.</p>\n<b>CURVE FEATURES</b>\n<b>Go back in time</b>\n<p>This allows you to change the payment card you used to pay for certain <b>transactions</b> after they were made.\nCheck out which transactions this is possible for in the Curve app (note that we can change this list and restrict customers from using this feature where we have a good reason to do so).\nBe aware your card issuer may charge a fee for this, which we\u2019re not responsible for.</p>\n<b>Curve Rewards</b>\n<p>From time to time, we offer our customers promotional offers with select retailers which you can choose to participate in if you wish.\nWe call this Curve Rewards.\nOur Curve Rewards Supplemental Terms are here.\nThe terms specific to individual offers will be presented to you at the time you select the offer.\nProvided that you comply with the terms of the offers you choose to take part in, we will pay to your Curve Cash card an amount in accordance with those offers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The funds paid by us to your Curve Cash card for any Curve Rewards offers will be held as e-money and safeguarded as required by UK law.\nAs noted above, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme does not apply to funds held in your Curve Cash card.\nThese funds are available for you to spend when you select the Curve Cash card as a funding source for your Curve card.</p>\n<p>Please note that you cannot use your Curve Cash card to withdraw cash and it cannot be used by you to pay any fees to Curve.\nIf you want to withdraw funds from your Curve Cash card, you can get in touch with us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Cash</b>\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes we offer our customers cashback in the form of points for using their Curve account and card - we call this Curve Cash.\nYou can check out the current Curve Cash Terms&nbsp.\non our <b>website</b>.\nWe change this every now and then but you can keep a tab on this through our website.</p>\n<p>Curve Cash is different to Curve Rewards.\nWith Curve Cash, you\u2019ll receive Curve Cash Points, which we add to your Curve Cash card.\nHowever, Curve Cash Points have no cash value and are not deemed to be e-money or any other equivalent of a fiat currency (unlike Curve Rewards).\nYour Curve Cash Points cannot be used to withdraw cash or otherwise be redeemed for cash.\nYou cannot use Curve Cash Points to pay for any fees due to Curve.</p>\n<p>When you use your Curve Cash card for a transaction, Curve will convert your Curve Cash Points to e-money (our little gift to you!) to the value of the transaction.\nYou will still be charged any fees that may be applicable to a transaction when these Points are used.\nIf there are not enough Curve Cash Points on your Curve Cash card, the transaction will be declined.\nPlease note that if your Curve Cash card holds Curve Cash Points in addition to other funds (for example, from Curve Rewards) then those other funds will be used first and your Curve Cash Points will only be converted to e-money and used when there are no other or insufficient other funds to complete a transaction.</p>\n<p>Curve Cash Points expire 6 months from the date they are added to your Curve Cash card.\nIf your Account is closed either by you or by Curve, you will not be able to

our actions which were not a foreseeable consequence of our actions.</p>\n<b>Changes to these Terms</b>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Because these Terms will continue till you or we end them, we may need to

<u>\n<b>support@curve.com</b>\n</u> or get in touch via the Curve app.</p>\n<p>These Terms apply to your use of Samsung Pay+, a digital or physical Mastercard debit card issued by Curve and co-branded with Samsung.\nIf you have a different Curve product, please see their terms <b>here</b>.</p>\n<p>If we need to contact you, we\u2019ll contact you in English via the Curve app, by email, phone or using your home address - depending on the information we need to share - so make sure your details are always up to date.\nIf in doubt, these Terms are concluded in English.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What are these Terms?</b>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms set out the terms of service for your use of Samsung Pay+, your Curve account and other important things you need to know.\nBy clicking \u201caccept/continue\u201d you\u2019re entering into a legally binding agreement with Curve OS Limited, which issues your Samsung Pay+ and electronic money (e-money).\nCurve is authorised to issue e-money by the Financial Conduct Authority (firm reference number 900926).\nBefore using Samsung Pay+, you&nbsp.\nwill also need to agree to Samsung Pay\u2019s separate terms of service as advised when setting up your Samsung Pay+ account in the Samsung Pay app.&nbsp.\nIn addition to these Terms, the Mastercard Digital Enablement Service Terms set out in Schedule 1 to these Terms also apply and form part of your agreement with us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can always download a set of the most recent Terms from our website and we will send you, when we need to make changes to these Terms, a copy of the new Terms by email.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Anything else you should read?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Fee Schedule forms part of these Terms and we highly recommend reading it.\nAlong with these Terms, you should take a look at our <u>Privacy Policy</u>, <u>Cookie Policy</u>, <u>Fair Use Policy</u>, <u>Curve Customer Protection Policy</u> and refer to the <u>FAQs</u> for any questions you may have.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Who can get Samsung Pay+?</b>\n</p>\n<p>You can get Samsung Pay+ and a Curve account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>if you\u2019re a resident in the United Kingdom.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>have the full legal capacity to enter into a contract.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you\u2019re 18 years old or over.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can\u2019t get one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>on someone else\u2019s behalf.\nor</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if you already have a Curve account.\nor</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if there is any reason that Curve is unable to grant you an account under the laws that apply to us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may ask you for additional information, from time-to-time,&nbsp.\nwhen you are opening your account or at a later stage, and if this information does not meet our requirements - this may result in your account opening being delayed or rejected or even suspension or closure of your account once opened.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What should you know about your Curve account?</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>E-money.\n</b>Your Curve account stores e-money, an electronic alternative to cash that can be used to pay for goods and services, in store or online and to take money out at an ATM.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) does not apply to e-money accounts, rest assured that your e-money is always kept separate from our own.\nThis is known as safeguarding.\nIt is required by law and ensures that your e-money is protected and returned to you in full if we decide to cease operations.\nHowever, if we were to become insolvent then the funds returned to you may be less than the total in your account, as the costs to arrange repayment and the costs of the administrators who would coordinate the return of customer funds, may be deducted from the funds owed to you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>No interest.\n</b>We\u2019re not allowed to pay you interest on the funds we hold for you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How it works.\n</b>You need to link and verify an <u>eligible payment card</u> to your Curve account through the Samsung Pay+ onboarding process app, before you can use your Samsung Pay+.\nThe payment card can be any debit card, credit card or prepaid card that we allow you to link to your Curve account.\nWe may need to introduce certain restrictions on the cards that we are able to accept on to the Curve system and will try to keep you informed on any changes, some of which may depend on the card schemes.\nTo use more than the one payment card you added during onboarding, you will need to download the Curve app and follow the process for adding and verifying payment cards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you make a transaction using your Samsung Pay+, Curve (with your permission) loads funds from your selected payment card to Curve, this is done for you automatically by the Curve processing system (no hassle to you).\nThe amount loaded will be the value of the transaction, plus any fees for that transaction that Curve is charging.</p>\n<p>The loaded funds are used to issue e-money which is loaded onto your Curve e-money account and is then used to pay for the transaction made with your Samsung Pay+.\nIf your selected payment card account has insufficient funds or declines the transaction for any other reason, the transaction will be declined.</p>\n<p>In case Curve receives a decline from the payment card selected in the Curve app, we&nbsp.\ntry to process the transaction from the cards that you have set as your default or back up cards including your Curve Cash card (for more information on how to set this up, go <u>here</u>).</p>\n<p>You can add multiple payment cards to the Curve app and change the selected payment card at any time using the Curve app.\nTo clarify, this can not be done through your Samsung Pay app.\nIf you change to a different payment card in Samsung pay app, it will not change the payment card in the Curve app.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each time you link a payment card to your Curve account you\u2019re giving us a continuous payment authority to use that payment card to fund the purchase of the e-money used to pay for transactions.\nCurve will use various means to identify and verify that the card you have added to your account is yours and that you have the right to use it.</p>\n<p>You can see your transactions on the timeline in the Curve app.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What should you know about your Samsung Pay+?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Curve will issue you either a personal or business Samsung Pay+.\nIt will either be a physical and/or digital card.\nA digital card is a card where you can see your Samsung Pay+ details in the Curve app, and can request a physical card if you want one (fees for this are in the Fee Schedule).\nYou will be able to add your Samsung Pay+ in digital form to your Samsung Pay app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;You can use your Samsung Pay+ to make purchases for goods and services, in store or online.\nTo withdraw cash you will need to order a physical Samsung Pay+.\nPlease note that you cannot withdraw cash at an ATM if you have your Curve Cash card selected as the funding source for your Samsung Pay+.</p>\n<b>GENERAL INFORMATION</b>\n<p>\n<b>What type of accounts can you open?</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Personal or business.\n</b>Curve offers both personal and business accounts.\nYou can only open a business account if you are a sole-trader or a self-employed natural person and intend to use your Curve account exclusively for business spend.\nYou cannot open a business account for a company or partnership.</p>\n<p>We can suspend your account or change it from business to personal if we reasonably think it is not being used for business purposes.\nIf we change your account type, we will issue you with a replacement card.\nFrom time to time, we may request further information from you to verify your business status and business spend.\nPlease note that the use of a Curve business account for personal spend is not permitted under these Terms.</p>\n<p>If you have a business account but wish to use Curve for personal reasons, you must contact us to change your account type.\nThere is no cost to you for this change.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Benefits.\n</b>Your Samsung Pay+ benefits can be viewed <b>here</b>.</p>\n<p>\n<b>More than one account.\n</b>You cannot hold more than one Curve account.\nWe can close down additional accounts without informing you first.\nThis also means that if you have a Samsung Pay+ then you will not be able to open a Curve account alongside.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Fees.\n</b>You can find details of the fees we charge in the Fee Schedule.\nWe will keep you informed before we introduce any new fee or make changes to any existing fees.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Replacement Card.\n</b>We charge fees for replacing your Samsung Pay+ at the time we process the request for a replacement card.\nWe can charge the fee from any of the payment cards linked to your Curve account.\nWe won\u2019t charge you to replace a card that has been stolen or misappropriated.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Fronted.\n</b>Using your Samsung Pay+ (with a debit or credit card as your payment card) to pay merchants who only accept payments by debit card, or who either impose a charge or deny certain types of debit or credit cards (e.g.\ntransactions to the HM Revenue and Customs in the UK, paying off a credit card with an underlying credit card selected), is defined by Curve as Curve Fronted transaction and will attract a service fee (see our Fees Schedule for details).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Please remember that when you fund your Samsung Pay+ with a credit card or other card that applies fees to transactions:</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Your underlying credit card issuer may also apply fees in relation to Curve Fronted transactions using Curve.\nCurve will not be liable for such fees.\nThese fees are strictly non-refundable in nature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may have to pay other costs, taxes or charges which are outside our control and not charged by us e.g.\nyour payment card issuer may charge you for making a payment through your Samsung Pay+.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Keeping your account safe</b>\n</p>\n<p>Please keep your Samsung Pay+, account information, security details and the devices you use to access your account safe.\nThis means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>signing your Samsung Pay+ as soon as you receive it (if physical card)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>not sharing your security details with anyone (including your Samsung Pay+ PIN, Curve app password or PIN or other security information used to protect your Curve account)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>not letting anyone else use your Samsung Pay+ or Curve app</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Keeping your Samsung Pay+ card and card details (physical or digital) safe</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>keeping your mobile phone and your email account secure.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think your card is lost or stolen, someone knows your security details or there are transactions on your account you don\u2019t recognise, you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>immediately lock your Samsung Pay+ in <u>the Curve app</u>;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>let us know ASAP by calling +44(0)2033222585 (lines are open 24/7), by email on support@curve.com or via the Curve app;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>stop using your Curve account and Samsung Pay+ until you hear from us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you find your Samsung Pay+ after you\u2019ve locked it but before you\u2019ve notified us, simply unlock it again via the app.\nPlease keep a look out for any suspicious transactions and follow the above procedure if you spot any.</p>\n<p>Because we send important notifications and information to you via the Curve app and the proper functioning and security of the app relies on updates from time to time, you agree that you will keep the Curve app on your mobile devices up to date.</p>\n<b>USING CURVE</b>\n<p>\n<b>Who can you provide access to your account?</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Uses.\n</b>You can use your Samsung Pay+ to make payments or withdraw cash.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Authorised transactions.\n</b>We\u2019ll consider a transaction to be authorised by you when you do at least one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>enter your PIN</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>sign a receipt</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>provide your Samsung Pay+ details (card number, expiry date, CVV number)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>wave or swipe your Samsung Pay+ (digital or physical) over or near a contactless payment reader</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>use your Samsung Pay+ and PIN to withdraw cash from a payment terminal, e.g at ATM</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>select a contact of yours and instruct the transfer of funds to that person in the Curve app.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Typically your authorisation for a transaction lasts for 30 days.\nIf a merchant processes your transaction after 30 days, you agree that we can still process the transaction.\nYou remain responsible under these Terms in respect of all transactions you authorise on your Curve account including all charges and other amounts incurred.\nYou also agree that if Curve is unable to collect the corresponding funds from your funding card at time these become due to be paid by Curve to the merchant, Curve is authorised to collect such funds from any of your other funding cards loaded into the Curve app.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cancelling transactions.\n</b>You can cancel a transaction you\u2019ve agreed to pay in the future up until close of business on the day before the transaction is due to take place.\nJust contact us to do this.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Changes to payment amounts.\n</b>Sometimes, you might make changes to a purchase between the time you authorise the transaction and the time the merchant processes it.\nIn these cases, the merchant may amend the payment amount to reflect this change.\nYou agree that we may pay the additional amount to the merchant on the basis of your initial authorisation and charge the shortfall from you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Pre-authorisations.\n</b>If you\u2019ve used your Samsung Pay+ to pre-authorise a transaction of less than \u00a3150 (or its equivalent in your local currency if you are using a non-UK funding card), we may place a block on those funds (meaning you can\u2019t use them) or charge the amount to your payment card at the time you pre-authorise the transaction.\nIf the final amount is less than \u00a3150, we\u2019ll refund or unblock the difference.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Continuous payment authority.\n</b>You can use your Samsung Pay+ to set up a future payment (either on a one-off or recurring basis) on a selected payment card.\nWe\u2019ll make the payment from the payment card you\u2019ve selected in the Curve App at the time we process the transaction, which may be a different payment card to the one you had selected at the time you set up the future payment.\nIf you need to cancel such payments, get in touch with us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Spending limits.\n</b>We have limits on how much you can spend or withdraw - these are set out in your Curve app.\nWe may change these limits every now and then.\nYou can ask us to increase your limits - if we refuse, you will have to wait 3 months to request another review.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Reasons we may refuse or delay a payment?</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Security:</b> We\u2019re concerned about the security of your Samsung Pay+ or account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Fraud:</b> We suspect fraud on your account</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Law or regulation:</b> We need to comply with the relevant law or regulation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Your actions:</b> The transaction breaches limits which apply to your Curve account you\u2019ve breached these Terms, you\u2019ve failed to provide us with information we\u2019ve asked for or your account has been blocked for any other legitimate reason, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Third parties:</b> If a third party (e.g.\na card network) prevents us from making the payment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll tell you if we refuse to make a payment and (where possible) why.</p>\n<p>We may need to contact you urgently if we suspect or find fraudulent activity has occurred on your account (provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law) or if we suffer a security threat.\nWhen we contact you, we will also give you information on how you can minimise any risk to your payment instrument depending on the nature of the fraud or security threat.\nWe\u2019ll use the same contact details which you have already provided us with when contacting you.\nso please make sure you keep your account details up to date either in the app or by contacting us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What about foreign currency transactions?</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>In case of withdrawals or purchases using your Curve card where the currency of your selected payment card is different to the currency of the transaction - Curve will perform a currency conversion for you.</b>\n</p>\n<p>If, when making the transaction, you have set your payment card currency in the Curve app to a different currency than that of the payment card itself then your payment card issuer may charge a fee for using their currency conversion services.\nThis might be in addition to any fees that Curve charges you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If we have to convert the currency of a payment made using your Samsung Pay+ we\u2019ll use an exchange rate which will be either the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Standard exchange rate.\n</b>On a weekday we will normally use an exchange rate collected from our wholesale provider, though when the exchange rate is volatile we may use the rate as of midnight on that day.\nWe\u2019ll use this rate during the hours foreign currency markets are open in the UK.\nWe can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Weekend exchange rate.\n</b>This is the rate at the time the markets are last closed in London, U.K.\nIt will apply from the time the markets close until they open again.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Exchange rates can fluctuate between the date you made the transaction and the date it\u2019s actually processed by the merchant to your account, please note that changes in the exchange rates will be applied immediately and without notice.\nThe rate applied to a transaction will be shown in the Curve app.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you use the Go Back in Time feature in relation to a foreign currency transaction, it\u2019s possible that a different exchange rate to the one used for the original transaction will apply.\nIf the merchant subsequently refunds the foreign transaction payment, the exchange rate used will be the one at the date the transaction was settled, not when the refund is settled.</p>\n<p>You can contact us at <b>support@curve.com</b> for details of the exchange rate for any transaction.\nYou can also find the exchange rate that was applied to your transaction in your Curve app.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll not be responsible to you if you\u2019re charged fees or lose any money if you ask the merchant or any other third party to make the currency conversion.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Who\u2019s responsible for losses on your Samsung Pay+ or account?</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>When you\u2019ll be responsible.&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>You\u2019re responsible for all losses where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>you\u2019ve acted fraudulently</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you deliberately failed to keep your device, account details or your Samsung Pay+ and account security details safe</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don\u2019t tell us as soon as you realise that your card is lost or stolen, when you think or suspect that someone else knows your security details, or there have been unauthorised transactions on your Samsung Pay+, you\u2019ll have to pay up to \u00a335&nbsp.\nof the losses.</p>\n<p>\n<b>When we\u2019ll be responsible.\n</b>We\u2019ll refund you any money you\u2019ve lost as a result of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>any unauthorised transaction which you\u2019ve promptly reported (and within 13 months of the transaction), provided you\u2019ve not acted fraudulently or carelessly;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>our mistakes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>transactions authorised by us after you locked your card (but only to the amount of the original authorisation).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also refund you where you\u2019ve used your Samsung Pay+ to make a payment within the UK without knowing the exact amount beforehand (e.g.\nwhen hiring a car) and the final amount is much higher than you reasonably would have expected.\nJust drop us a line through the Curve app or at support@curve.com within 8 weeks of the transaction and provide us with any further information we need to look into this.\nWe\u2019ll then make a decision either to refund the transaction or give you reasons why we can\u2019t accept your request.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What can I not use my Curve account and Samsung Pay+ for?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We know most customers will, but you must use your Curve account and Samsung Pay+ responsibly.\nYou can\u2019t use them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>for anything that\u2019s against the law (e.g.\nfraud) or is harmful or disrespectful to others, including any form of abuse of us or our staff</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in breach of these Terms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in a way that might harm our ability to provide our services or or harm our software, systems or hardware</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in a way that your funding card issuer, a card network, our acquirer and/ or payment processor, would see as an abuse of the payments system;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to pay for adult entertainment, gambling, cryptocurrencies, money orders (except wire transfers) and travellers cheques from non-financial institutions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for \u201ccash recycling\u201d, which means using your Samsung Pay+ to make an ATM withdrawal and using the cash to repay the payment card used for the withdrawal in order to receive rewards on the payment card or your Samsung Pay+;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to create one or more Curve account(s) without our permission;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>attempt to \u201cdouble dip\u201d or to do anything during the course of a dispute to receive funds from us and your bank or payment card issuer for the same transaction;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to make transactions which are not allowed by the issuer of your linked payment card e.g.\ncash advances or transactions for investment purposes.\nCheck your payment card\u2019s Terms to see what\u2019s allowed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Money owed to Curve</b>\n</p>\n<p>In the event you owe Curve money either for fees or transactions that you have made using Curve, we may immediately charge such amounts to any of your payment cards.\nWe reserve the right to collect the amount of your debt to Curve by using any payments received to your Account.\nWe may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency.</p>\n<b>CURVE FEATURES</b>\n<p>In order to use these features, you need to download and use the Curve app.\nThese features are not available on the Samsung Pay app.\nTo download the Curve app - please click here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Go Back In Time</b>\n</p>\n<p>This allows you to change the payment card you used to pay for certain transactions after they were made.\nCheck out which transactions this is possible for in the Curve app (note that we can change this list and restrict customers from using this feature where we have a good reason to do so).\nBe aware your payment card issuer may charge a fee for this, which we\u2019re not responsible for.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Rewards</b>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, we offer our customers promotional offers with select retailers which you can choose to participate in if you wish.\nWe call this Curve Rewards.\nOur Curve Rewards Supplemental Terms are <u>here</u>.\nThe terms specific to individual offers will be presented to you at the time you select the offer.\nProvided that you comply with the terms of the offers you choose to take part in, we will pay to your Curve Cash card an amount in accordance with those offers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The funds paid by us to your Curve Cash card for any Curve Rewards offers will be held as e-money and safeguarded as required by UK law.\nAs noted above, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme does not apply to funds held in your Curve Cash card.\nThese funds are available for you to spend when you select the Curve Cash card as a funding source for your Samsung Pay+.</p>\n<p>Please note that you cannot use your Curve Cash card to withdraw cash and it cannot be used by you to pay any fees to Curve.\nIf you want to withdraw funds from your Curve Cash card, you can get in touch with us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Cash</b>\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes we offer our customers cashback in the form of points for using your Samsung Pay+ or Curve account - we call this Curve Cash.\nYou can check out the current Curve Cash offers you may be eligible for on our website <u>here</u>.\nWe change this every now and then - you can keep a tab on this through our website.\nCertain rewards programmes are introductory offers and may be restricted to a set number of days - in such cases please carefully refer to any information provided to you by Curve in the app or by email.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Curve Cash is different to Curve Rewards.\nWith Curve Cash, you\u2019ll receive Curve Cash Points, which we add to your Curve Cash card.\nHowever, Curve Cash Points have no cash value and are not deemed to be e-money or any other equivalent of a fiat currency (unlike Curve Rewards).\nYour Curve Cash Points cannot be used to withdraw cash or otherwise be redeemed for cash.\nYou cannot use Curve Cash Points to pay for any fees due to Curve.</p>\n<p>When you use your Curve Cash card for a transaction, Curve will convert your Curve Cash Points to e-money (our little gift to you!) to the value of the transaction.\nYou will still&nbsp.\nbe charged any fees that may be applicable to a transaction when these Points are used (if applicable as per the Fee Schedule).\nIf there are not enough Curve Cash Points on your Curve Cash card, the transaction will be declined.</p>\n<p>Please note that if your Curve Cash card holds Curve Cash Points in addition to other funds (for example, from Curve Rewards) then those other funds will be used first and your Curve Cash Points will only be converted to e-money and used when there are no other or insufficient other funds to complete a transaction.</p>\n<p>Curve Cash Points expire 6 months from the date they are added to your Curve Cash card.\nIf your Account is closed either by you or by Curve, you will not be able to redeem the value of your Curve Cash Points.</p>\n<b>Open banking permissions</b>\n<p>We may provide you access through the Curve app to a third party AIS and PIS provider (otherwise known as TPP).\nTheir services will allow you to obtain financial information from your online payment accounts held with other providers (account information services) and to make online payments directly from your third party payment accounts held with other providers (payment initiation services, when available).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you want to use the TPP services, you will need to sign up to the TPP\u2019s terms and conditions during the sign up process and provide them your details in order to create an account on their system and to access your data or execute payments.\nWe have no responsibility for the products and services provided to you by or through the TPP and will not be liable to you for any harm, damage or loss arising from your use of the products and services provided to you by or through the TPP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The terms and conditions that apply to the payment accounts that you access through the TPP are not affected by these terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Curve is not responsible for the information that you receive from your other online payment account providers or TPPs.&nbsp;</p>\n<b>CLOSING &amp.\nSUSPENDING ACCOUNTS</b>\n<p>\n<b>When can we block, suspend or close your account?</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Blocking.</b> We\u2019ll block your account if we have reasonable concerns about your account\u2019s security or suspect fraud or where law or regulation requires us to.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Suspension and closure.\n</b>We may immediately suspend or close your account for a number of reasons including where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>you use Curve in a way that these Terms don\u2019t allow,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you don\u2019t provide us

behaviour towards us makes it difficult to deal with you (e.g.\nyou insult our staff),</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you\u2019ve broken these Terms in a serious or persistent way and you haven\u2019t put the matter right within a reasonable time of us asking you to,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>we\u2019re required to by law or regulation,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you\u2019re declared bankrupt,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>we can verify that you have died.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll give you at least 2 months\u2019 notice if we want to close your account for any other reason, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How can you close your account?</b>\n</p>\n<p>You can cancel your account at any time by emailing us at support@curve.com or contacting us in the Curve app.\nYou\u2019ll get a refund of any subscription fees you\u2019ve paid if you change your mind within the first 14 days of signing up (the \u201ccooling off\u201d period).\nYou will be charged pro rata if you have used any of the Curve services (including receiving a card).</p>\n<p>On closing your account, you still need to pay us any fees you owe us or any transactions that have not yet completed.\nYou\u2019ll also need to make sure you cancel any outgoing payments you don\u2019t want to pay anymore.\nIf there is a balance on your Curve account, this will be redeemed to an underlying card\u2019s bank account - once we complete our checks (if needed).</p>\n<p>If any balance is still remaining on your account when your account is closed you can request to have these funds returned to a bank account in your name, subject to our checks.\nYou forfeit your rights on these funds if you do not claim these funds within 6 years from the date your account was closed.\nDuring this period your funds will be kept safe as required by law.&nbsp;</p>\n<b>COMPLAINTS</b>\n<p>\n<b>How can you make a complaint?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We hope you don\u2019t ever need to but if you do ever want to complain, you can contact us

IMPORTANT LEGAL STUFF</b>\n<p>\n<b>Our liability</b>\n</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll not be responsible for any money you\u2019ve lost as a result of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a merchant or ATM provider refusing to

laws.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019re also not responsible for any charges you have to pay to third parties, like your payment card issuers, for using the Curve account and services.</p>\n<p>If we breach our Terms with you, we\u2019ll only be responsible for losses that could have been foreseen at the time we entered into these Terms and are directly related to the event in question.\nWe\u2019ll do all we reasonably can to make sure that our services are not interrupted and are accessible at a reasonable speed.\nHowever, we can\u2019t promise that this will always be the case e.g.\nwhere we rely on third parties to process payments.</p>\n<p>Nothing in these Terms will stop us being responsible to you, if we act fraudulently, we act with a very significant degree of carelessness, or we\u2019re at fault and the law does not allow us to exclude or limit our liability.\nWe will not be liable to you in respect of any losses you or any third party may suffer in connection with the use of Curve\u2019s service - app, account or Samsung Pay+ as a result of our actions which were not a foreseeable consequence of our actions.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Changes to these

tell you once we\u2019ve made them.\nOtherwise, we\u2019ll give you 2 months\u2019 notice before the change will come into effect - so you can easily end these Terms if you don\u2019t agree with the changes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may amend these Terms to reflect changes, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>to the law or regulatory requirements</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to the way we manage your Curve account as

Curve\u2019s products (that is try to reproduce them after a detailed examination of their composition).</p>\n<p>\n<b>English law applies</b>\n</p>\n<p>English law will decide any legal questions about this agreement, and about our dealings with you with a view to entering into it.</p>\n<p>If you are living in England or Wales when this agreement starts, the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to it.</p>\n<p>If you are living in a different part of the UK when this agreement starts, English law will still apply, but will not act to deprive you of any mandatory protections that would have been afforded to you in that region.\nIn addition, the courts of that country will have jurisdiction to hear any claims in relation to this agreement, but you can

is to create a connected world of finance and provide you with a convenient and simple way to manage your finances, in order to allow you to live life\u2019s rich experiences.\nIn order to ensure that the experience of using your Curve card mirrors the experience of using your selected underlying payment card, there are some fair use limitations, which we highlight below.</p>\n<p>For further information please see&nbsp;Curve Terms of Use&nbsp;(which includes definitions for terms used below) and&nbsp;Curve FAQs.</p>ATM credit card withdrawal fair use<p>Curve strongly discourages using an underlying credit card in order to withdraw cash.\nPlease note that your underlying credit card issuer may charge you fees for making such transactions with your Curve card.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above fees, Curve may charge you an additional 2% for withdrawals above \u00a3200 (or currency equivalent) per calendar month, when using a credit card as the underlying card.\nPlease note that this is not a limit per credit card, but a cumulative for all credit card withdrawals using your Curve card in a calendar month.\nThis charge does not apply to ATM debit card withdrawals.</p>\n<p>Our platform uses third-party systems to identify whether the Funding Source is a debit or credit card.\nIf you believe your card has been incorrectly defined you should contact us at:&nbsp;support@curve.com, where you will be required to provide evidence as such in order for your case to be investigated.</p>ATM withdrawal fair use<p>Curve\u2019s fees and limits are separate from any terms your card issuer may apply to cash withdrawals or similar transactions.\nPlease check your card issuer\u2019s terms of service for clarification.</p>ATM domestic frequency fair usage<p>ATM usage is free for up to 10 domestic (withdrawals in the same currency as your Funding Source) withdrawals per calendar month after which time you may be charged \u00a30.50 (or currency equivalent) per usage for each additional ATM withdrawal.</p>Cash recycling<p>In addition to the fees listed above, any behaviour which Curve deems to be \u201ccash recycling\u201d is not permitted.\nThis is where high volumes of cash (e.g.\ndefined by a high cash to spend ratio) are taken out of an ATM using a credit card or other payment card and then used to repay the card in order to gain rewards on the funding card or Curve Rewards.\nDepending on the account activity, \u201chigh volumes of cash withdrawals\u201d could include spending which is under \u00a3200/ month as it will be assessed on the volume and frequency of ATM withdrawals compared to non-ATM spend.\nAny other equivalent usage which the Curve Compliance Team believes aims to achieve the same outcome, for example via the use of money transfer services, topping up savings accounts, transferring cash between payment accounts using Curve is also not permitted.\nSuch behaviour may result in your Curve account being blocked or cancelled.\nSee&nbsp;Curve Terms of Use&nbsp;for further information.</p>Compliance with your underlying card issuer\u2019s terms<p>You always need to be compliant with the terms of use and policies of your underlying payment card.\nYour Curve card should not be used for any transactions which are not permissible with or are penalised by your underlying credit card issuer, such as any cash advance or quasi-cash transactions including money orders, buying lottery tickets, paying certain taxes, or transactions for investments purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Non-permissible and penalised transactions may also include \u2018Curve Fronted\u2019 transactions discussed below.\nPlease see here for examples of such transactions.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Always make sure you check the terms and conditions of your underlying payment card issuer(s) before using this feature.\nPlease bear in mind that fees may be applied by your underlying card issuer for making such transactions using Curve (in addition to any fees charged by Curve) and that Curve shall not be liable for fees from your underlying card issuer.</p>Curve Fronted transactions:<p>Curve has functionality which enables you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>pay off your credit card bills with a different underlying credit card selected in the Curve app</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>make other financial transactions where you normally cannot pay with a credit card or where you would incur significant fees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>make government payments where you normally cannot use a credit card or incur significant fees</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These types of transactions incur a 1.5% fee, depending on the Curve card subscription you are on (see our Terms of Service and our FAQs).\nIn addition to any fees charged by Curve, note that the issuer of your underlying card which is funding the Curve Fronted transaction may also charge you fees/fines for these transactions.\nYou will be able to use the Curve card, with an underlying debit card selected, to pay off your credit card bills for no charge (and this usually has no impact on your credit rating).</p>\n<p>You must check the terms and conditions of your underlying card issuer(s) before making Curve Fronted transactions, along with any terms associated with the financial product you are trying to pay, e.g.\ncredit cards, P2P loans, etc.\nYou must ensure you fully understand any associated risks in making a Curve Fronted transaction.\nFor example, using Curve Fronted to pay off your credit card bill may impact your credit rating.</p>\n<p>In case you use your Curve card to make Curve Fronted transactions paying off your credit card bill with an underlying credit card and then use the Go Back in Time function to change the underlying funding card to a debit card, your Curve Fronted fees will be refunded and it would not qualify as a Curve Fronted transaction.\nPlease note this may still (i) impact your credit rating, and (ii) mean your underlying credit card provider may charge you fees/fines.</p>\n<p>Curve retains the right to withdraw this feature and/or disallow you from the use of your Curve card and services in the event you fail to use it responsibly and in compliance with applicable terms and this fair use policy.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading the policy.</p>", "created_at": "2021-07-08 22:08:58.997842",

data about you will depend on the purposes for which the data was collected, whether you have requested deletion of the data, and whether we have any legal or regulatory obligation to retain the

Terms, you should take a look at our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Fair Use Policy, Curve Customer Protection Policy and refer to the FAQs for any questions you may have.</p>\n<p>Definitions used in these Terms are provided in Annex No 1.\nPlease read these Terms carefully and contact us at <b>support@curve.com</b> or get in touch via the Curve app if you have any questions.&nbsp;</p>\n<b>Who can open a Curve account?</b>\n<p>You can open a Curve account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>if you\u2019re a resident in one of the <b>eligible countries</b> listed in the app or on our website,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>have the full legal capacity to enter into a contract, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you\u2019re 18 years old or over.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can\u2019t open a Curve account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>on someone else\u2019s behalf, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if you already have a Curve account, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if there is any reason that Curve is unable to grant you an account under the law that applies to us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you open your account, we ask you for information which is required to open the account.&nbsp.\nIf this information is not provided, your account opening will be delayed.&nbsp.\nWe may ask you for additional information, from time to time, in addition to what you provided when you opened your account and if this information is not provided to meet our requirements this may result in your account being suspended or closed.</p>\n<b>What should you know about your Curve account?</b>\n<p>\n<b>E-money.\n</b>Your Curve account stores e-money, an electronic alternative to cash that can be used to pay for goods and services, in store or online and to take money out at an ATM.\nRest assured that your money is always kept separate from our own.\nThis is known as customer funds safeguarding.\nIt is required by law and ensures that your money is protected and returned to you in full if we decide to cease operations or become insolvent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>No interest.\n</b>We\u2019re not allowed to pay you interest on the funds we hold for you and they are <b>not protected </b>by the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nDon\u2019t worry: Curve is required to keep your funds safe in a safeguarding bank account, which means that all of your funds are protected.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How it works.\n</b>You need to link and verify an eligible payment card to your Curve account in the Curve app, before you can use your Curve card.\nThe payment card can be any debit card, credit card or prepaid card that we allow you to link to your Curve account.\nWe may need to introduce certain restrictions on the cards that we are able to accept on to the Curve system and will try to keep you informed on any changes, some of which may depend on the card schemes.</p>\n<p>When you make a transaction using your Curve card, Curve (with your permission) loads funds from your selected payment card to Curve.\nThis is done for you automatically by the Curve processing system (no hassle to you).\nThe amount loaded will be the value of the transaction, plus any fees for that transaction (including for any Curve services provided).</p>\n<p>The loaded funds are used to issue e-money which is loaded onto your Curve e-money account and are then used to pay for the transaction made with your Curve card.\nIf your selected payment card account has insufficient funds or declines the transaction for any other reason, the transaction will be declined.</p>\n<p>In case Curve receives a decline from the payment card selected in the Curve app, we may try to process the transaction from the cards that you have set as your default or back up cards (for more information on how to set this up, go here)</p>\n<p>You can add multiple payment cards to the Curve app and change the selected payment card at any time using the Curve app.</p>\n<p>Each time you link a payment card to your Curve account you\u2019re giving us a continuous authority to use that payment card to fund the purchase of the e-money used to pay for transactions.\nCurve will use various means to identify that the card you have added to your account is yours and that you have the right to use it.</p>\n<p>You can see your transactions on the timeline in the Curve app.</p>\n<b>What should you know about your Curve card?</b>\n<p>Curve will issue you either a personal or business Curve Card, based on the purpose of the card use you selected during the sign-up process.\nIt will either be a physical and/or digital card.\nA digital card is a card where you can see your Curve card details in the Curve app only, and can request a physical card if you want one (fees for this are in the Fee Schedule).</p>\n<p>You can use your Curve card to make purchases for goods and services, in store or online.\nTo withdraw cash, you will&nbsp.\nneed a physical Curve card.\nPlease note that you cannot withdraw cash at an ATM if you have your Curve Cash card selected as a funding source for the Curve card.</p>\n<b>ACCOUNTS &amp.\nSECURITY</b>\n<b>What type of accounts can you open?</b>\n<p>\n<b>Personal or business.\n</b>Curve offers both<b>\n</b>personal and&nbsp.\nbusiness accounts.\nYou can only open a business account if you are a sole-trader or a self-employed natural person and intend to use your Curve account exclusively for business spend.\nYou cannot open a business account for a company or partnership.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We can suspend your account or change it from business to personal if we reasonably think it is not being used for business purposes.\nIf we change your account type, we will issue you with a replacement card.\n.\nFrom time to time, we may request further information from you, to verify your business status and business spend.\nPlease note that the use of a Curve business account for personal spend is not permitted under these Terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have a business account but

under the Curve Black section of the Fee Schedule</p>\n<p>\n<b>Minimum subscription periods</b>\n</p>\n<p>When you subscribe to Curve Black or Metal, you can choose to pay monthly or annually.\nDepending on which you choose, minimum subscription periods apply.</p>\n<p>\n<b>If you choose to pay monthly,</b> the minimum subscription period is 6 months.\nIf you wish to cancel your subscription you may do so but you will not be refunded any amount paid for the current month of the subscription.\nIf you cancel your subscription and it is less than 4 months since the start of it, you must give us 2 months\u2019 advance notice (such notice period to run from the end of your current subscription month).\nYou do not need to give us advance notice if you want to cancel and it is more than 4 months since the start of it.</p>\n<p>\n<b>If you choose to pay annually</b>, the minimum subscription period is 12 months.\nThis minimum subscription period will apply each time your subscription is renewed.\nIf you wish to cancel your subscription you may do so but you will not be refunded any amount of the annual subscription fee.\nYou do not need to give us advance notice to cancel your subscription.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In all cases where your subscription is subject to a minimum subscription period (whether 6 months because you pay monthly or 12 months because you pay annually), you will continue to have all of the benefits available under those subscriptions until the end of the period for which you have paid.\nFor example, if you cancel your 12 month subscription during its second month, you can continue to use the benefits under the subscription for the remaining 10 months.</p>\n<p>If you were&nbsp.\nan existing Curve Black or Metal subscriber at the time version 1.2 of these Terms was published (29 April 2021), the minimum subscription periods detailed above will not apply to you for so long as you continue on your current subscription (this includes annual subscribers when their subscription renews).\nIf you upgrade from Black to Metal or downgrade from Metal to Black or change your subscription payment schedule from monthly to annually or annually to monthly, the minimum subscription periods will apply.</p>\n<p>\n<b>More than one account.\n</b>You can not hold more than one Curve account.\nWe can close down additional accounts without informing you first.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Upgrading your account.\n</b>You can upgrade your account simply by clicking on the \u2018Manage Your Subscription\u2019 tab in the app.\nYou can also change the payment card your subscription is charged to using the same tab.</p>\n<p>If we can\u2019t charge your nominated payment card for subscription fees or any other fees you owe us - e.g., if your card has expired or has insufficient funds - you agree that we can take them from any other payment card you\u2019ve linked to your Curve account.\nIf we can\u2019t take the fees from any of the other payment cards either, you\u2019ll need to provide us with a valid payment card within 30 days of our request to do so, otherwise we may either close or downgrade your account.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Downgrading your account.\n</b>You can downgrade your account by getting in touch with us and fees may be payable in accordance with the Fee Schedule.</p>\n<p>Curve reserves the right to restrict the ability to subscribe to the Curve Metal or Curve Black account for customers who upgrade or downgrade from another type of Account, more than once in a given 12 month period.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Fees.\n</b>You can find details of the fees we charge in the Fee Schedule.\nWe will keep you informed before we introduce any new fee or make changes to any existing fees.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Replacement Card.\n</b>We charge fees for replacing your Curve card at the time we process the request for a replacement card.\nWe can charge the fee from any of the payment cards linked to your Curve account.\nWe won\u2019t charge you to replace a card that has been stolen or misappropriated.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Fronted</b>\n<b>.\n</b>Using your Curve card (with a debit or credit card as your payment card) to pay merchants who only accept payments by debit card, or who either impose a charge or deny certain types of credit cards (e.g.\n<b>paying off a credit card with an underlying credit card selected</b>), is defined by Curve as a Curve Fronted transaction and will attract a service fee (see our Fees Schedule for details).\nPlease note that before you start using this function you should make sure that your underlying credit card issuer allows usage of your credit card to fund Curve card transactions.</p>\n<p>Please remember that when you fund your Curve card with a credit card or other card that applies fees to transactions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>your underlying credit card issuer may also apply fees in relation to Curve Fronted transactions using Curve.\nCurve will not be liable for such fees.\nThese fees are strictly non-refundable in nature,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you may have to pay other costs, taxes or charges which are outside our control and not charged by us e.g.\nyour payment card issuer may charge you for making a payment through your Curve card.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Keeping your account safe</b>\n<p>Please keep your Curve card, account information, security details and the devices you use to access your account safe.\nThis means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>signing your Curve card as soon as you receive it (if you can),</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>not sharing your security details with anyone (including your Curve card PIN, Curve app password or PIN or other security information used to protect your Curve account),</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>not letting anyone else use your Curve card or Curve app,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>keeping your Curve card and card details (physical or digital) safe,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>making sure you close down the Curve app when you're not using it;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>keeping your mobile phone and your email account secure.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think your card is lost or stolen, someone knows your security details or there are transactions on your account you don\u2019t recognise, you must immediately:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>immediately lock your Curve card in the app,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>let us know ASAP by calling +44(0)2033222585 (lines are open 24/7) or any number linked <b>here</b>, by email on <b>support@curve.com</b> or via the Curve app,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>stop using your Curve account and card until you hear from us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you find your Curve card after you\u2019ve locked it but before you\u2019ve notified us, simply unlock it again via the app.</p>\n<p>Because we send important notifications and information to you via the Curve app and the proper functioning and security of the app relies on updates from time to time, you agree that you will keep the Curve app on your mobile devices up to date.</p>\n<b>USING CURVE</b>\n<b>Using your Curve card</b>\n<p>\n<b>Uses.\n</b>You can use your Curve card to make payments online or at mPos or to withdraw cash.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Authorised transactions.</b> We\u2019ll consider a transaction to be authorised by you when you do at least one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>enter your PIN,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>sign a receipt,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>provide your Curve card details (card number, expiry date, CVV number),</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>wave or swipe your Curve card (digital or physical) over or near a contactless payment reader,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>use your Curve card and PIN to withdraw cash from a payment terminal, e.g at ATM,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>select a contact of yours and instruct the transfer of funds to that person in the Curve app.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you use your Curve Card to make a withdrawal from an ATM or make a payment (for example, in a shop or restaurant), we will consider the payment to be authorised by you unless:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>you let us know that the money has been stolen from your account.\nor</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you don't think we've carried out your instructions correctly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We start to process your transaction at the time you use your card either for an ATM withdrawal, online transaction or payment at a terminal.\nIt\u2019s important to note that the authorisation for a transaction lasts for 30 days and can be processed at any time during these 30 days.\nIf a merchant processes your transaction after 30 days, you agree that we can still process the transaction.\nYou remain responsible under these Terms in respect of all transactions you authorise on your Curve account including all charges and other amounts incurred.\nYou also agree that if Curve is unable to collect the corresponding funds from your funding card at time these become due to be paid by Curve to the merchant, Curve is authorised to collect such funds from any of your other funding cards loaded into the Curve app.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cancelling transactions.\n</b>You can cancel a transaction you\u2019ve agreed to pay in the future up until close of business on the day before the transaction is due to take place.\nJust contact us to do this.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Changes to payment amounts.\n</b>Sometimes, you might make changes to a purchase between the time you authorise the transaction and the time the merchant processes it.\nIn these cases, the merchant may amend the payment amount to reflect this change.\nYou agree that we may pay the additional amount to the merchant on the basis of your initial authorisation and charge the shortfall to&nbsp.\nyou.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Pre-authorisations.\n</b>If you\u2019ve used your card to pre-authorise a transaction of less than EUR 150 (or its equivalent in your local currency), we may place a block on those funds (meaning you can\u2019t use them) or charge the amount to your payment card at the time you pre-authorise the transaction.\nIf the final amount is less than EUR 150, we\u2019ll refund or unblock the difference.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Continuous payment authority.\n</b>You can use your Curve card to set up a future payment (either on a one-off or recurring basis) on a selected payment card.\nWe\u2019ll make the payment from the payment card you\u2019ve selected in the Curve App at the time we process the transaction, which may be a different payment card to the one you had selected at the time you set up the future payment.\nIf you need to cancel such payments, get in touch with us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Spending limits.\n</b>We have limits on how much you can spend or withdraw - these are set out in your Curve app.\nWe may change these limits every now and then.\nYou can ask us to increase your limits - if we refuse, you have to wait 3 months to request another review.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Reasons we may&nbsp.\nrefuse or delay a payment?</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Security: </b>We\u2019re concerned about the security of your Curve card or account,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Fraud: </b>We suspect fraud on your account,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Law or regulation: </b>We need to comply with the relevant law or regulation,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Your actions: </b>The transaction breaches limits which apply to your Curve account you\u2019ve breached these Terms, you\u2019ve failed to provide us with information we\u2019ve asked for, or your account has been blocked for any other legitimate reason, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Third parties: </b>If a third party (e.g.\na card network) prevents us from making the payment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we are permitted to do so, we\u2019ll tell you if we refuse to make a payment and (where possible) why.</p>\n<p>We may need to contact you urgently if we suspect or find fraudulent activity has occurred on your account (provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law) or if we suffer a security threat.\nWhen we contact you, we will also give you information on how you can minimise any risk to your payment instrument depending on the nature of the fraud or security threat.\nWe\u2019ll use the same contact details which you have already provided us with when contacting you.\nso please make sure you keep your account details up to date by contacting us.</p>\n<b>What about foreign currency transactions?</b>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>In case of withdrawals or purchases using your Curve card where the currency of your selected payment card is different to the currency of the transaction - Curve will perform a currency conversion for you.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>If, when making a transaction, you have set your payment&nbsp.\ncard currency in the Curve app to a different currency than that of the payment card itself then your payment card issuer may charge a fee for using their currency conversion services.\nThis might be in addition to any fees that Curve charges you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If we have to convert the currency of a payment made using your Curve card we\u2019ll use an exchange rate which will be either the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Standard exchange rate.</b>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a weekday we will normally use an exchange rate collected from our wholesale provider, though when the exchange rate is volatile we may use the rate as of midnight on that day.\nWe\u2019ll use this rate during the hours foreign currency markets are open in London, UK.\nWe can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Weekend exchange rate.</b>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the rate at the time the markets are closed in London, U.K.\nIt will apply from the time the markets close until they open again.\nWe can let you know the rate for a transaction if you get in touch with us.</p>\n<p>Please check our Fee schedule to find out the currency conversion fee applicable for the currency exchange transactions.</p>\n<p>Exchange rates can fluctuate between the date you made the transaction and the date it\u2019s actually processed by the merchant to your account, please note that changes in the exchange rates will be applied immediately and without notice.\nThe rate applied to a transaction will be shown in the Curve app.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you use the Go Back in Time feature in relation to a foreign currency transaction, it\u2019s possible that a different exchange rate to the one used for the original transaction will apply.\nIf the merchant subsequently refunds the foreign transaction payment, the exchange rate used will be the one at the date the transaction was settled, not when the refund is settled.</p>\n<p>You can contact us at support@curve.com for details of the exchange rate for any transaction.\nYou can also find the exchange rate that was applied to your transaction in your Curve app.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll not be responsible to you if you\u2019re charged fees or lose any money if you ask the merchant or any other third party to make the currency conversion.</p>\n<b>Who\u2019s responsible for losses on your Curve card or account?</b>\n<p>\n<b>When you\u2019ll be responsible.\n</b>You\u2019re responsible for all losses where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>you\u2019ve acted fraudulently,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you deliberately failed to keep your device, account details or your Curve card and account security details safe.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don\u2019t tell us as soon as you realise that your card is lost or stolen, when you think or suspect that someone else knows your security details, or there have been unauthorised transactions on your Curve card, you\u2019ll have to pay up to EUR 50 (or its equivalent in your home currency) of the losses.</p>\n<b>When we\u2019ll be responsible.&nbsp;</b>\n<p>We'll always try to process your payments correctly and on time, but sometimes things go wrong.</p>\n<p>\n<b>If they do, </b>we\u2019ll refund you any money you\u2019ve lost as a result of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>any unauthorised transaction which you\u2019ve promptly reported (and within 13 months of the transaction), provided you\u2019ve not acted fraudulently or carelessly,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>our mistakes, or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>transactions authorised by us after you locked your card (but only to the amount of the original authorisation).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also refund you where you\u2019ve used your Curve card to make a payment in the European Economic Area (EEA) without knowing the exact amount beforehand (e.g.\nwhen hiring a car) and the final amount is much higher than you reasonably would have expected.</p>\n<p>Just drop us a line through the app or at support@curve.com as soon as you notice it but not later than&nbsp.\n13 months after the date of the transaction, and provide us with any further information we need to look into this.\nWe\u2019ll then make a decision either to refund the transaction or give you reasons for rejecting your request.</p>\n<b>What can I not use my Curve account and Curve card for?</b>\n<p>We know most customers will but you must use your Curve account and card responsibly.\nYou can\u2019t use them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>for anything that\u2019s against the law (e.g.\nfraud) or is harmful or disrespectful to others, including any form of abuse of us or our staff,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in breach of these Terms,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in a way that might harm our ability to provide our services or may harm our software, systems or hardware,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in a way that your payment card issuer, a card network, our acquirer and/ or payment processor, would see as an abuse of the payments system,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to pay for adult entertainment, gambling, cryptocurrencies, money orders (except wire transfers) and travellers\u2019 cheques from non-financial institutions,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for \u201ccash recycling\u201d, which means using your Curve card to make an ATM withdrawal and using the cash to repay the payment card used for the withdrawal in order to receive rewards on the payment card or your Curve card,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to create one or more Curve account(s) without our permission attempt to \u201cdouble dip\u201d or to do anything during the course of a dispute to receive funds from us and your bank or payment card issuer for the same transaction,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to make transactions which are not allowed by the issuer of your linked payment card e.g.\ncash advances or transactions for investment purposes.\nCheck your payment card\u2019s terms to see what\u2019s allowed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Money owed to Curve</b>\n<p>In the event you owe Curve money either for fees or transactions that you have made using Curve, or missed subscription fees, we may immediately charge such amounts to any of your payment cards.\nWe reserve the right to collect the amount of your debt to Curve by using any payments received to your Account.\nWe may also recover amounts you owe us through legal means, including, without limitation, through the use of a debt collection agency.</p>\n<b>CURVE FEATURES</b>\n<b>Go back in time</b>\n<p>This allows you to change the payment card you used to pay for certain transactions after they were made.\nCheck out which <b>transactions</b> this is possible for in the Curve app (note that we can change this list and restrict customers from using this feature where we have a good reason to do so).\nBe aware your card issuer may charge a fee for this, which we\u2019re not responsible for.</p>\n<b>Curve Rewards</b>\n<p>From time to time, we offer our customers promotional offers with select retailers which you can choose to participate in if you wish.\nWe call this Curve Rewards.\nOur Curve Rewards Supplemental Terms are here.\nThe terms specific to individual offers will be presented to you at the time you select the offer.\nProvided that you comply with the terms of the offers you choose to take part in, we will pay to your Curve Cash card an amount in accordance with those offers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The funds paid by us to your Curve Cash card for any Curve Rewards offers will be held as e-money and safeguarded as required by Lithuanian law.\nThese funds are available for you to spend when you select the Curve Cash card as a funding source for your Curve card.</p>\n<p>Please note that you cannot use your Curve Cash card to withdraw cash and it cannot be used by you to pay any fees to Curve.\nIf you want to withdraw funds from your Curve Cash card, you can get in touch with us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Curve Cash</b>\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes we offer our customers cashback in the form of points for using their Curve account and card \u2013 we call this Curve Cash.\nYou can check out the current Curve Cash Terms&nbsp.\non our website.\nWe change this every now and then but you can keep a tab on this through our <b>website</b>.</p>\n<p>Curve Cash is different to Curve Rewards.\nWith Curve Cash, you\u2019ll receive Curve Cash Points, which we add to your Curve Cash card.\nHowever, Curve Cash Points have no cash value and are not deemed to be e-money or any other equivalent of a fiat currency (unlike Curve Rewards).\nYour Curve Cash Points cannot be used to withdraw cash or otherwise be redeemed for cash.\nYou cannot use Curve Cash Points to pay for any fees due to Curve.</p>\n<p>When you use your Curve Cash card for a transaction, Curve will convert your Curve Cash Points to e-money (our little gift to you!) to the value of the transaction.\nYou will still be charged any fees that may be applicable to a transaction when these Points are used.\nIf there are not enough Curve Cash Points on your Curve Cash card, the transaction will be declined.</p>\n<p>Please note that if your Curve Cash card holds Curve Cash Points in addition to other funds (for example, from Curve Rewards) then those other funds will be used first and your Curve Cash Points will only be converted to e-money and used when there are no other or insufficient other funds to complete a transaction.</p>\n<p>Curve Cash Points expire 6 months from the date they are added to your Curve Cash card.\nIf your Account is closed either by you or by Curve, you will not be able to redeem the value of your Curve Cash Points.</p>\n<b>Using the Curve app to access accounts with other service providers</b>\n<p>You can also access your accounts with other service providers and initiate payments from those accounts.\nWe call these Account Information Service (AIS) and Payment Initiation Service (PIS).</p>\n<p>When you use our AIS to view information about an account you hold with another provider, or use our PIS to initiate a payment from an account you hold with another provider to initiate a transaction, you must authorise us to access that account and/ or make a payment.\nWe won\u2019t store any of the sensitive payment data you provide to give that authorisation.</p>\n<p>We will consider that you gave us consent and authorised us to initiate payments or view information from those accounts when you choose in your Curve app the certain service and filled in requested information.</p>\n<b>Open Banking permissions</b>\n<p>We may provide you access through the Curve app to a third party AIS and PIS provider - to check whether this service is available in your country - please check <b>here</b>.\nThese services will allow you to obtain financial information from your online bank or third party payment account (account information services) and to make online payments directly from your third party payment account (payment initiation services).\nYou will need to sign up to the third party AIS and PIS provider\u2019s terms and conditions during the sign up process and provide them your details in order to create an account on their system and to access your data or execute payments.\nWe have no responsibility for the products and services provided to you by or through the AIS and PIS third party provider and will not be liable to you for any harm, damage or loss arising from your use of the products and services provided to you by or through the third party AIS and PIS provider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The terms and conditions that are connected to your third party payment account apply to the payment accounts that you access through the third party AIS and PIS provider will remain in effect and are not amended by these terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Curve is not responsible for the information that you receive from the third party payment account provider or third party AIS and PIS provider.&nbsp;</p>\n<b>CLOSING &amp.\nSUSPENDING ACCOUNTS</b>\n<b>When can we block, suspend or close your account?</b>\n<p>\n<b>Blocking.\n</b>We\u2019ll block your account if we have reasonable concerns about your account\u2019s security or suspect fraud, money laundering or where law or regulation requires us to.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Suspension and

liability</b>\n<p>We are liable for proper execution of your payment transactions.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll not be responsible for any money you\u2019ve lost as a result of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a merchant or ATM provider refusing to accept your Curve card,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>us suspending or closing your account in accordance with these Terms,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Curve implementing a legal or regulatory requirement,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>unforeseeable events outside our control, where the consequences would have been unavoidable despite our best efforts,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>goods or services that you purchase using your Curve card,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>loss or corruption of data unless caused by our wilful wrongdoing,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>our compliance with applicable laws.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019re also not responsible for any charges you have to pay to third parties, like your payment card issuers or payment account service providers, for using the Curve account and services.</p>\n<p>If we breach our Terms with you, we\u2019ll only be responsible for losses that could have been foreseen at the time we entered into these Terms and are directly related to the event in question.\nWe\u2019ll do all we reasonably can to make sure that our services are not interrupted and are accessible at a reasonable speed.\nHowever, we can\u2019t promise that this will always be the case e.g.\nwhere we rely on third parties to process payments.</p>\n<p>Nothing in these Terms will stop us being responsible to you, if we act fraudulently, we act with a very significant degree of carelessness, or we\u2019re at fault and the law does not allow us to exclude or limit our liability.\nWe will not be liable to you in respect of any losses you or any third party may suffer in connection with the use of Curve\u2019s service - app, account or Curve card as a result of our actions which were not a foreseeable consequence of our actions.</p>\n<b>Changes to these Terms</b>\n<p>Because these Terms will continue till you or we end them, we may need to change these Terms every now and then.\nIf we make changes that are clearly in your favour, we\u2019ll tell you once we\u2019ve made them.\nOtherwise, we\u2019ll give you 2 months\u2019 notice before the change will come into effect - so you can easily end these Terms if you don\u2019t agree with the changes.</p>\n<p>Any such changes will only of course be made if they are reasonable.\nWe\u2019ll assume you\u2019re happy with the change unless you tell us otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may amend these Terms to reflect changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>to the law or regulatory requirements,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to the way we manage your Curve account as a result of changes in technology and changes to the Curve system that we use,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in the cost of providing your account and other Curve services,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to our existing products and services,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>and anything else that we currently can\u2019t predict.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll assume you\u2019re happy with the changes unless you tell us otherwise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may not be able to give you 2 months\u2019 notice before changes take effect if they are due to reasons outside our control.\nIf so, you will always have 2 months from when they take effect to cancel your account free of charge.</p>\n<b>Our contract with you</b>\n<p>\n<b>Personal to you.\n</b>Only you and we have any rights under these Terms.\nThese Terms are personal to you and you can\u2019t transfer any rights or obligations under them to anyone else.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Transfer.\n</b>We can transfer any of our rights and obligations under the Terms to comply with a legal or regulatory requirement and we reasonably think that a transfer would not have a significantly negative effect on your rights.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Severability.\n</b>If for any reason a part of these Terms becomes invalid or unenforceable, we both agree that the invalid or unenforceable parts can be removed and that the rest of the Terms will still be enforceable.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Waiver.\n</b>If you fail to keep to any of your obligations and we don\u2019t take action against you (immediately or ever), we can still take action at a later date.</p>\n<b>Our intellectual property</b>\n<p>Curve owns all the intellectual property in the Curve products and services or has a license to use them, e.g.\nCurve app, Curve website, Curve logo and card designs.\nYou agree you won't use Curve's intellectual property, except to use Curve\u2019s products.\nAlso, you agree you won\u2019t reverse engineer any of Curve\u2019s products (that is try to reproduce them after a detailed examination of their composition).</p>\n<b>Lithuania law applies</b>\n<p>Lithuania law will decide any legal questions about this agreement, and about our dealings with you with a view to entering into it.</p>\n<p>If you are living in another EEA country when this agreement starts, Lithuania law will still apply, but will not act to deprive you of any mandatory protections that would have been afforded to you in that country.\nIn addition, the competent authorities of that country will have jurisdiction to hear any claims in relation to this agreement, but you can still bring a claim against us in the competent authorities of Lithuania if you want to.</p>\n<b>Your Data</b>\n<p>By agreeing these terms, you also agree to us using your information to make and receive payments on your account, and any other lawful grounds that Curve has to use your information.\nIf you\u2019re no longer happy for us to use your information, we\u2019ll have to close your account.\nWe may keep your personal data and use it where we have lawful grounds to do so.\nFor example, any identity verification information we need to maintain for regulatory reasons (please refer to our Privacy
