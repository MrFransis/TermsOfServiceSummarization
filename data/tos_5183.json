Agreement.</p>10.\nDispute Resolution, Arbitration, and Class Action Waiver<p>We hope that our customer success team can resolve any issues you may have.\nHowever, if that does not work, then both parties agree to resolve any dispute arising out of these terms exclusively by individual, binding arbitration.\nThe term \u201cdispute\u201d is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and will include disputes related to your use of the Service, this Agreement (including the scope of this provision), regardless of whether such disputes are based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, unfair competition, or some other legal theory.\nDisputes regarding privacy shall be resolved by the mechanisms outlined in our&nbsp.\nPrivacy Policy.</p>\n<p>The arbitration process can be a faster, simpler, less formal, and less expensive route than filing a lawsuit and going to court.\nIn arbitration you are still entitled to a fair hearing, but your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator (and not a judge or jury).\nArbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order, and are subject only to very limited review by a court.\nEach party is giving up the right to sue in court and to have a trial before a judge or jury.</p>\n<p>Each party here agrees to try in good faith for 30 days to informally resolve any dispute before starting arbitration.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the dispute as well as the relief sought.\nIf you want to send such a notice to us, send it to&nbsp;legal@mightynetworks.com.\nIf we want to send such a notice to you, we will send it to the email address associated with your account.\nIf the parties do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within 30 days after the date the notice was sent, then the parties may start arbitration as described below.</p>\n<p>The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration, and the arbitration will be governed by the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by these terms.\nThose rules and information about how to start arbitration are available at&nbsp;www.adr.org&nbsp;or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitrator is bound by these terms.\nThe arbitration will be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator\u2019s award will be final and specifically enforceable

States and are subject to state and federal laws of the United States.\nIf you are located outside the United States, your Personal Information is being transferred to, stored, used, and shared in the United States.</p>\n<p>Following the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield by the Court of Justice of the European Union on July 16, 2020 (known as the \u201cSchrems II\u201d decision) and of the Swiss-US Privacy Shield on September 8, 2020, Personal Data subject to the GDPR are no longer transferred by or to Mighty Software on the basis of the Privacy Shield but are instead subject to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.&nbsp.\nThe Schrems II decision also placed additional compliance requirements on the use of EU Standard Contract Clauses (SCC) for transfer of EU/EEA Personal Data to the U.S.\nby companies subject to Section 702 of the U.S.\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and/or Executive Order 12333 (E.O.\n12333).&nbsp.\nIt is our good faith belief that the types of EU/EEA Personal Data we receive, collect, process, use and/or share in the U.S.\nare not of the types of data that would generally be subject to requests from U.S.\ngovernment authorities pursuant to FISA Section 702 and/or E.O.\n12333.</p>\n<p>As explained above in this Privacy Policy in Section 2(b), we sometimes share your Personal Information with Third Party service providers so they can perform services for us.\nIf we share Personal Information we have received from EU/EEA/Swiss data subjects, with a Third Party, that Third Party\u2019s access, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information will be subject to the Standard Contractual Clauses.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Standard Contractual Clauses, like the Privacy Shield Principles, we may be liable to you for the failure of our service providers to comply with the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>\n<p>While EU and U.S officials are working to resolve the issues which were the basis for the Schrems II decision invalidating the EU-U.S Privacy Shield framework, we continue to adhere to the EU Privacy Shield Principles required by our Privacy Shield Certification(s).\nWe remain subject to the regulatory and enforcement authority of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission.\nIf you are located in the UK, European Union (EU), Switzerland or European Economic Area (EEA), and have a question or complaint regarding data collected in the UK, EU, EEA or Switzerland that was transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield Frameworks, you should first direct your question or complaint to dpo@mightnetworks.com.\nYou can also write or call us at the following address: Mighty Software, Inc., 127 Lytton Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94301, Phone: 415-935-4253.</p>\n<p>Mighty Software Inc.\ncontinues to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus.</p>\n<p>If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please
