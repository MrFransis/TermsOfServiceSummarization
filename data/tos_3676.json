online registration, order descriptions or order confirmations referencing this Agreement (\u201c<b>Order Forms</b>\u201d).\nIf you are accessing or using the Services on behalf of your company, you represent that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on behalf of your company, and all references to \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cCustomer\u201d reference your company.</p>\n<p>The

below and in the Documentation.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.1.\n&nbsp;Overview</b>.<b> &nbsp;</b>Segment\u2019s \u201c<b>Connections</b>\u201d Service acts as a central hub for Customer Data, allowing Customer to collect Customer Data from its selected sources (\u201c<b>Sources</b>\u201d), such as its own or third-party websites or properties, and send the Customer Data to Customer\u2019s chosen destinations (\u201c<b>Destinations</b>\u201d), such as Customer\u2019s databases or its accounts with third-party applications or services, for Customer\u2019s further use.\nThe supported Sources and Destinations are identified in the Documentation.\nFor Sources owned or controlled by Customers (\u201c<b>Customer Properties</b>\u201d), Customer enables the collection of Customer Data by implementing Segment\u2019s JavaScript, SDK or other code (\u201c<b>Segment Code</b>\u201d) on such Customer Properties.\n&nbsp;As further described below and in the Documentation, Customer maintains control over which Sources and Destinations it uses with the Services, as well as the types and content of Customer Data it shares between its Sources and Destinations.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.2.\n&nbsp;Additional Services</b>.\nIf included on an Order Form, Customer may also receive access to additional Segment services that may be used with Connections (e.g.\nPersonas or Protocols).\nThe features of any additional services are further described in the applicable Order Form.\nFor clarity, any additional services are considered part of the Services for purposes of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.3.\n&nbsp;Definitions</b>\n</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>Customer Data</b>\u201d means any data that Customer submits to the Services, including data that it collects from Customer Properties or retrieves from other Sources through the Services, including as may be incorporated in any Customer reports or output generated by the Services.\nCustomer Data does not, however, include any Segment or third-party templates, technology or data.</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>Documentation</b>\u201d means the end user technical documentation provided with the Services, as may be modified from time to time.</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>Laws</b>\u201d means all applicable local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and conventions, including those related to data privacy and data transfer,

sensitive information subject to regulation or protection under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act or similar foreign or domestic Laws.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>Service(s)</b>\u201d means the specific Segment proprietary hosted service(s) (e.g.\nConnections, Protocols, Personas) specified on an Order Form, including any related Segment dashboards, APIs and Segment Code.</p>\n<p>\u201c<b>Usage Data</b>\u201d means Segment\u2019s technical logs, account and login data, data and learnings about Customer\u2019s use of the Services (e.g., frequency of logins, volume of Customer Data collected or sent to Destinations).\n&nbsp;For clarity, Usage Data does not include Customer Data.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.4.\n&nbsp;Provision of the Services</b>.\nThe Services are provided on a subscription basis for a set term designated on the Order Form (each, a \u201c<b>Subscription Term</b>\u201d) unless otherwise specified in Section 2 (Service Plans and Beta Releases).\nCustomer shall purchase and Segment shall provide the Services as specified in the applicable Order Form.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.5.\n&nbsp;Access to the Services</b>.\n&nbsp;During the Subscription Term (as defined below), Customer may access and use the Services for its internal business operations, subject to this Agreement, the Documentation, and any scope of use restrictions on the applicable Order Form.\n&nbsp;This includes the right to implement Segment Code on Customer Properties in order to collect Customer Data for use with the Services.\n&nbsp;Access to the Services is limited to Customer\u2019s employees and contractors acting for the sole benefit of Customer (\u201c<b>Permitted Users</b>\u201d).\nCustomer and its Permitted Users may need to register for a Segment account in order to access or use the Services.\nAccount registration information must be accurate, current and complete, and will be governed by Segment\u2019s Privacy Policy (currently available at https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/).\nCustomer is responsible for any use of the Services by its Permitted Users and their compliance with

and re-sending of Customer Data to Destinations at Customer\u2019s direction.\n&nbsp.\nCustomer acknowledges that Customer Data transmitted through the Services may be stored and processed by Segment in the United States or in other countries as approved or directed by Customer (e.g., through Customer\u2019s selection of a regional option through the Services).\n&nbsp;For clarity, nothing in this Section 1.6 prohibits Segment from transmitting Customer Data to Customer\u2019s designated Destinations as part of the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.8.\n&nbsp;Data Protection Addendum</b>.\nThe parties agree to comply with the terms of the Data Protection Addendum attached as <u>Exhibit B</u>.</p>\n<b>2.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;SERVICE PLANS AND BETA RELEASES</b>\n<p>\n<b>2.1.\n&nbsp;Services Plans</b>.\nSegment makes available the Services through paid plans (\u201c<b>Paid Plans</b>\u201d), a free \u201cFree\u201d plan (\u201c\u201d), a free \u201cFree\u201d plan (\u201c<b>Free Plan</b>\u201d) and trial plans (\u201c<b>Trial Plans</b>\u201d).\nCurrent plans are described at \u201d).\nCurrent plans are described at https://segment.com/pricinghttps://segment.com/pricing and Customer\u2019s specific plan will be identified in the Order Form presented when Customer registers, orders or pays for the Services.\nCustomer\u2019s permitted scope of use (such as features available, permitted number of monthly tracked users (MTUs) and other usage limits) depends on the plan that Customer selects and will be specified on the applicable Order Form.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.2.\n&nbsp;Paid Plans</b>.\nPaid Plans are provided for the Subscription Term designated on the applicable Order Form and, unless otherwise specified on the Order Form, each Subscription Term shall automatically renew for the same period as the then-current Subscription Term unless either party gives the other written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the then-current Subscription Term (e.g., monthly Paid Plans will automatically roll over month-to-month and annual Paid Plans will automatically renew for additional 12-month periods).</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.3.\n&nbsp;Free Plans and Trial Plans </b>\n</p>\n<p>a) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<u>Free Plans</u>.\nUnder Free Plans, Customer may use the Services, and the Subscription Term is ongoing until either (a) Segment or Customer terminate this Agreement or (b) Segment ceases to offer the Free Plan, whichever occurs first.</p>\n<p>b) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<u>Trial Plans</u>.\nUnder Trial Plans, Customer may use the Services solely to determine whether to purchase a Paid Plan, and the Subscription Term will be thirty (30) days unless otherwise specified in the Order Form.\nIf Customer does not upgrade from a Trial Plan to a Paid Plan at the end of the Subscription Term, then Customer\u2019s access to the Services may be limited or suspended (to be determined at Segment\u2019s sole discretion) until such time as Customer terminates this Agreement or converts to a Paid Plan.</p>\n<p>c) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<u>Special Terms</u>.\nFree Plans and Trial Plans may not include all features or functionality offered as part of Paid Plans, and Segment reserves the right to add or subtract any features or functionality at any time for such plans.\nSegment has the right to suspend or terminate a Free Plan or Trial Plan at any time for any reason.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.4.\n&nbsp;Beta Releases</b>.\nCustomer may receive access to a Service (or Service features) as an alpha, beta or early access offering (\u201c<b>Beta Releases</b>\u201d).\nSegment identifies all Beta Releases as such and any usage by Customer is optional.\nUse of a Beta Release is permitted only for Customer\u2019s internal evaluation during the period designated by Segment (or if not designated, 30 days) and may be subject to additional terms provided by Segment and agreed by Customer.\nSegment may suspend or terminate Customer\u2019s access to Beta Releases at any time for any reason.\nBeta Releases may be inoperable, incomplete or include features that Segment may never release, and their features and performance information are Segment\u2019s Confidential Information.\n\u201d).\n<b>Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Segment\u2019s liability for Beta Releases will not exceed US$50.Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Segment\u2019s liability for Beta Releases will not exceed US$50.</b>\n</p>\n<b>3.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS</b>\n<p>\n<b>3.1.\n&nbsp;Data Collection</b>.\nSubject to this Agreement and as further described in the Documentation, Customer may configure the Customer Data elements to be collected from Sources and shared with different Destinations.\nIn some instances, as referenced in the Services dashboard and Documentation, enabling a third-party Destination involves implementing the third-party provider\u2019s own SDK or code on Customer Properties.\nAs a result, in these cases, certain default data designated by that Destination\u2019s provider may be sent directly to Customer\u2019s accounts with that Destination, rather than passing through the Services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.2.\n&nbsp;Rights in Customer Data</b>.\nCustomer is solely responsible for the accuracy, content and legality of all Customer Data.\nCustomer represents and warrants to Segment that (1) Customer will comply with all applicable Laws in its use of the Services (including, if applicable, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, European Union Regulation 2016/679 and similar Laws governing cross-site tracking or automated decision-making) and (2) Customer has provided all disclosures and obtained all necessary rights, consents and permissions to collect, share and use Customer Data as contemplated in this Agreement (including granting Segment the rights in Section 5.1 and Customer\u2019s building, tracking, using or sharing of any user profiles, traits or audiences), without violation or infringement of (i) any third party intellectual property, publicity, privacy or other rights, (ii) any Laws, or (iii) any terms of service, privacy policies or other agreement governing the Customer Properties or Customer\u2019s accounts with third-party Sources or Destinations.\nBy enabling use of the Services with any Source or Destination, Customer authorizes Segment to access Customer\u2019s accounts with such Source or Destination for the purposes described in this Agreement.\nIn addition, in order to provide the Services to Customer and improve Segment\u2019s integrations with Sources and Destinations, Segment may also disclose Customer\u2019s status as a Segment customer and related technical Services data to the providers of Customer\u2019s Sources and Destinations.</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.3.\n&nbsp;No Sensitive Personal Information</b>.<b> &nbsp.\n&nbsp;</b>Customer specifically agrees not to use the Services to collect, store, process or transmit any Sensitive Personal Information.\n&nbsp;Customer acknowledges that Segment is not a

necessary cooperation of Segment (at Customer\u2019s expense for reasonable out-of-pocket costs).&nbsp;</p>\n<b>4.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;SECURITY</b>.<b> &nbsp.\n&nbsp;</b>\n<p>Segment agrees to use commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of the Services or Customer Data, as further described in Segment\u2019s Information Security Policy attached as <u>Exhibit A</u>.\n&nbsp;However, Segment shall have no responsibility for errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond Segment\u2019s control.</p>\n<b>5.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;OWNERSHIP</b>&nbsp;<p>\n<b>5.1.\n&nbsp;Customer Data</b>.\nAs between the parties, Customer shall retain all right, title and interest (including any and all intellectual property rights) in and to the Customer Data as provided to Segment.\n&nbsp;Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer hereby grants to Segment a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, create derivative works of and display the Customer Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services to Customer during the Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.2.\n&nbsp;Segment Technology</b>.\nThis is a subscription agreement for access to and use of the Services.\nCustomer agrees that Segment or its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Services, all Documentation and any and

below).\nSegment may generate Usage Data to operate, improve, analyze and support the Services, for benchmarking and reporting and for Segment\u2019s other lawful business purposes.\nExcept as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no rights in the Services or any Segment technology are granted to Customer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.3.\n&nbsp;Feedback</b>.\n&nbsp;Customer, from time to time, may submit comments, questions, suggestions or other feedback relating to any Segment product or service to Segment (\u201c<b>FeedbackFeedback</b>\u201d).\nSegment may freely use or exploit Feedback in

Customer will pay all fees at the end of the month and (ii) for annual Subscription Terms, Customer will pay all fees within thirty (30) days of invoice.\n&nbsp;Except as expressly set forth in Section 12.1 (Modifications to this Agreement), all fees are non-refundable.\n&nbsp;Segment reserves the right to increase the rates specified in the Order Form upon any renewal of a Subscription Term.\n&nbsp;Any late payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.2.\n&nbsp;Taxes</b>.<b>\n</b>Segment\u2019s fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, including for example, value-added, sales, use

Forms, except that Segment is solely responsible for taxes assessable against Segment based on Segment\u2019s net income, property, and employees.\nIf any deduction or withholding is required by law, Customer shall notify Segment and shall pay Segment any additional amounts necessary to ensure that the net amount that Segment receives, after any deduction and withholding, equals the amount Segment would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.3.\n&nbsp;Overages</b>.\nIf Customer exceeds its permitted usage in any month of a Subscription Term as specified in an Order Form, Segment reserves the right to charge overage fees in respect of such excess usage at the applicable overage rates set forth in the Order Form.\nCustomer will pay any overage fees monthly in arrears.</p>\n<b>7.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;TERM AND TERMINATION</b>\n<p>\n<b>7.1.\n&nbsp;Term</b>.\n&nbsp;This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and expires on the date of expiration

notify Customer of the engagement, which notice may be given by updating the Subprocessor Page and via a message through Customer\u2019s Segment Workspace.\nSegment will give such notice at least ten (10) calendar days before the new Subprocessor Processes any Customer Personal Data, except that if Segment reasonably believes engaging a new Subprocessor on an expedited basis is necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the Customer Personal Data or avoid material disruption to the Services, Segment will give such notice as soon as reasonably practicable.\nIf, within five (5) calendar days after such notice, Customer notifies Segment in writing that Customer objects to Segment\u2019s appointment of a new Third Party Subprocessor based on reasonable data protection concerns, the parties will discuss such concerns in good faith and whether they can be resolved.\nIf the parties are not able to mutually agree to a resolution of such concerns, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the Agreement for convenience.</p>\n<p>7.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<b>Security</b>\n</p>\n<p>a.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Segment shall implement and maintain technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Customer Personal Data from Security Incidents and to preserve the security and confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data, in accordance with Segment\u2019s security standards referenced in the Agreement (\u201c<b>Security Measures</b>\u201d).</p>\n<p>b.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available by Segment relating to data security and making an independent determination as to whether the Services meet Customer\u2019s requirements and legal obligations under Data Protection Laws.\nCustomer acknowledges that the Security Measures may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Segment\u2019s obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).</p>\n<p>c.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Upon becoming aware of a confirmed Security Incident, Segment shall notify Customer without undue delay unless prohibited by applicable law.\nA delay in giving such notice requested by law enforcement and/or in light of Segment\u2019s legitimate needs to investigate or remediate the matter before providing notice shall not constitute an undue delay.\nSuch notices will describe, to the extent possible, details of the Security Incident, including steps taken to mitigate the potential risks and steps Segment recommends Customer take to address the Security Incident.\nWithout prejudice to Segment\u2019s obligations under this Section 7.c., Customer is solely responsible for complying with Security Incident notification laws applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third party notification obligations related to any Security Incidents.\nSegment\u2019s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this Section 7.c.\nwill not be construed as an acknowledgement by Segment of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.</p>\n<p>d.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Customer agrees that, without limitation of Segment\u2019s obligations under this Section 7, Customer is solely responsible for its use of the Services, including (a) making appropriate use of the Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of the Customer Data.\n(b) securing the account authentication credentials, systems and devices Customer uses to access the Services.\n(c) securing Customer\u2019s systems and devices that it uses with the Services.\nand (d) maintaining its own backups of Customer Data.</p>\n<p>8.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<b>Data Subject Requests</b>\n</p>\n<p>Segment shall upon Customer\u2019s request (and at Customer\u2019s expense) provide Customer with such assistance as it may reasonably require to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws to respond to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in cases where Customer cannot reasonably fulfill such requests independently by using the self-service functionality of the Services.\nIf Segment receives a request from a Data Subject in relation to their Customer Personal Data, Segment will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be responsible for responding to any such request.</p>\n<p>9.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<b>Return or Deletion of Data</b>\n</p>\n<p>a.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Segment shall, within sixty (60) days after request by Customer following the termination or expiration of the Agreement, delete all of the Customer Personal Data from Segment\u2019s systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer understands that Segment may retain Customer Personal Data if required by law, which data will remain subject to the requirements of this Addendum.</p>Annex A \u2013 EU Annex<p>1.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<b>Definitions.\nProcessing of

undertakes to inform Segment without delay and instruct their employee to contact Segment directly via privacy@segment.com or such other email address as directed at the time.</p>\n<p>b.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<b>Audits and Reviews of Compliance</b>.\n</p>\n<p>To the extent applicable Data Protection Laws include a right for Customer to audit Segment\u2019s Processing of Customer Personal Data, Customer will exercise such audit right, and Segment will fulfill its corresponding obligations, as follows: </p>\n<p>(i) &nbsp.\nSegment shall make available to Customer relevant information regarding Segment\u2019s Processing of Customer Personal Data under this Addendum in the form of Segment\u2019s most recent ISO 27001, ISO 27017 or ISO 27018 certifications or

Customer Personal Data for compliance with its obligations under this Addendum by submitting reasonable requests for information, including security and audit questionnaires.\nSegment will provide written responses to the extent the requested information is necessary to confirm Segment\u2019s compliance with this Addendum.\nHowever, if the requested information is addressed in a Third Party Report issued within the 12-month period prior to Customer\u2019s request and Segment confirms there have been no material changes in the interim relevant to Customer\u2019s request, Customer agrees to accept such Third Party Report in lieu of a written response.\nAny information provided by Segment under this Section 2.b.\nconstitutes Segment\u2019s Confidential Information under the Agreement.</p>\n<p>(iii) &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nIf a third party is to conduct an audit under this Section 2.b., Segment may object to the auditor if the auditor is, in Segment\u2019s reasonable
