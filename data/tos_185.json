and there will be a match only if you have used the same identifier (such as an email address) with Netflix and the third party.\nIf there is a match, Netflix can then choose whether or not to send a given promotional communication to you on that third party site or app, and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online advertising.\nYou can opt out in the \u201cMarketing

as voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information may differ from ours.\nFor example, you may be able to access the Netflix service through platforms such as gaming systems, smart TVs, mobile devices, set top boxes and a number of other Internet connected devices.\nThese websites and

cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons), as well as resettable device identifiers, for various reasons.\nWe want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so this section explains the types of technologies we use, what they do, and your choices regarding their use.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and similar technologies, web beacons, and resettable device identifiers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services.\nWe use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL).\nLike cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on your device.\nWeb beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies.\nIn many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.</p>\n<p>If you use the Netflix app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device.\nResettable device identifiers (also known as advertising identifiers) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the \"Identifier for Advertisers\" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the \"Google Advertising ID\" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.\nLike cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant and for analytics and optimization purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Why does Netflix use these technologies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it easy to access our services by remembering you when you return.\nto provide, analyze, understand and enhance the use of our services.\nto enforce our terms, prevent fraud.\nto improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site.\nand to deliver and tailor our marketing or advertising, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and online ads on third party sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To help you better understand how we use cookies and resettable device identifiers, please see the information below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Essential cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service.\nFor example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them.\nThey also help us to enforce our Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies help us to customize and enhance your online experience with Netflix.\nFor example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up).\nWe also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research.\nDeletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising cookies and resettable device identifiers:</strong> These cookies and resettable device identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you and for analytics and optimization purposes.\nThese types of ads are called \"interest-based advertising.\" The advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In connection with our use of these technologies, some of the websites and apps where we advertise, as well as advertising technology companies that we use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure our advertisements (collectively \u201cAdvertising Partners\u201d), may receive limited information from us as part of our campaign targeting, measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps completed in sign-up and site visit or app open/install information).</p>\n<p>Common uses of this type of information are to judge the effectiveness of and optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see when someone who saw an ad later signed up for our service.&nbsp.\nAnother common use is to make sure we do not serve ads trying to get individuals to sign up for the Netflix service if they are already a Netflix user.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Netflix uses contractual and technical measures designed to prevent Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific title selections you make, URLs you land on, or shows you have watched on our service.\nWe do not share information about title selections or your shows you have watched on our service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To exercise choice regarding cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here.\nAt this time, we do not respond to web browser \"do not track\" signals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with a resettable device identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under \"privacy\" or \"ads\" in your device's settings).\nYou may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To exercise choice using self-regulatory program resources</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Canada: AdChoices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique du Canada (DAAC)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>To exercise choice regarding other technologies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL).\nFor example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area.\nsee your browser's help function or support area to learn more.\nOther technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To see

Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance and functionality cookies:</strong> These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with Netflix.\nFor example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member

service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research.\nDeletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising cookies and advertising identifiers:</strong> These cookies and advertising identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you.\nThese types of ads are called \"interest-based advertising.\" Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How can I exercise choice regarding cookies and advertising identifiers?</strong>\n<p>For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here.</p>\n<p>To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an advertising identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under \"privacy\" or \"ads\" in your device's settings).\nYou may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.</p>\n<p>Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)</li>\n<li>In Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)</li>\n<li>In Canada: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicit\u00e9 num\u00e9rique du Canada (DAAC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this time, we do not respond to Web browser \"do not track\" signals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How Does Netflix use Web Beacons and other Technologies?</strong>\n<p>Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies.\nWe and our Service Providers may use them for similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use of our service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing (including email and online ads on third party sites).\nBecause web beacons often work in conjunction with cookies, in many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.</p>\n<p>We use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL).\nLike cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device.\nWe may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service.\nThere are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies.\nFor example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area.\nsee your browser's help function or support area to learn more.\nOther technologies, such as
