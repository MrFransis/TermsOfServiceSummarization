can handle your back-order: 1.) you can prepay for your back-ordered items and their applicable shipping charge, and we will ship your order as soon as it\u2019s complete.\nThis will get your back-ordered items shipped as quickly as possible.\nOR 2.) we can call you as soon as your items are back in stock.\nThis gives you the opportunity to add to your order and potentially save on shipping charges, if your new total meets one of our discounted shipping thresholds.\nIf a back-order stays open for 60 days, we will cancel the back-order and refund, as a store credit, any money collected.\nAll back-orders are treated as new and separate orders from their original order, and any applicable shipping charges will be applied.\nIf items on an original order must be back-ordered for any reason, and that puts the original order below the threshold for free shipping, you will be responsible for applicable shipping charges.\nWe try our hardest to maintain appropriate stock levels at all times, but due to situations out of our control, we may run out of a product.\nAs these situations are outside of our control, we cannot be responsible for any changes in shipping charges.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nPricing, terms and conditions are subject to change without notice.\nDue to the rising costs of fuel &amp.\nit's impact on the economy, price changes may occur without notice.\nWe are sorry for any inconvenience.\n<p>\n<b>\n<i> *Drop-Ship fee of $5.00 on all Drop-ship orders under $100.00.<br>\n</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n</b>\n</p>\n<b>Privacy &amp.\nMarketing
