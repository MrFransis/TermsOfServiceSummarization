Terms <p>Your subscription to the Services (as defined in the Ancestry Terms and Conditions) and purchase of AncestryDNA\u00ae and AncestryHealth\u00ae is subject to these Renewal and Cancellation Terms.\nCapitalized terms used in these Renewal and Cancellation Terms if not defined here are as defined in the Terms and Conditions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Subscriptions</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are various payment and subscription options available for using the Services.\nThese options can be found in the individual Services and may change from time to time.\nOnce you register for a free trial or your initial payment is processed, your subscription has begun, and you can immediately access the relevant Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nAutomatic Renewals of Subscriptions</strong>.\nUnless otherwise noted in the terms of your offer, subscriptions automatically renew, except for gift and pay-per-view subscriptions.\nThis means that once you sign up for a free trial or become a subscribing member, your subscription will automatically renew based on the subscription program you chose (e.g.\nsemiannually, monthly, etc.).\nYou will be charged the rate stated at the time of purchase (plus applicable taxes, such as value added tax when the stated rate doesn\u2019t include VAT) at the beginning of each billing term of your subscription via the billing method you have provided to us.\nPlease ensure that your billing information is correct to prevent an interruption in your subscription.</p>\n<p>Prices and terms for subscriptions may change at any time.\nThe price and terms in place when you made your initial purchase or when your subscription last renewed will stay in effect for the duration of that subscription period, but new prices and terms may apply to renewals or new subscriptions.\nAncestry will give you reasonable notice of any change in price or terms before they go into effect.\nIf you do not want to renew your subscription under these new prices or terms, you may cancel your subscription as described below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nSubscription

a Month, Billed Upfront</u>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>For Ancestry subscriptions</u>: </strong>Except as outlined below, if you cancel this type of subscription before the end of your subscription period, you are not eligible for a refund, but you will retain access to the relevant Services for the remainder of your subscription period, after which your subscription will be cancelled.\nIf your subscription did not begin with a free trial, during the first 14 days of your first subscription term you may either (1) cancel immediately for a full refund and immediate loss of access, or (2) cancel at the end of your current subscription, with no refund.\nIf you do not cancel your subscription within your subscription period, we will renew your subscription for additional

usage.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>For Fold3, Newspapers.com, and Archives subscriptions</u>: </strong>Subscriptions longer than one month that are billed upfront may be canceled during the first 30 days

remaining cost of your subscription.\nIf you do not cancel your subscription within your subscription period, we will renew your subscription for additional terms equivalent in length to your current subscription, until you cancel.\nAfter your subscription renews, you are not eligible for any refunds.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Gift Memberships</u>: Gift memberships may be canceled by the purchaser for a full refund before the earlier of (a) 30 days after the date the gift is purchased and (b) the gift start date selected by the purchaser.\nNo refunds are available after the gift start

months at the end of your current billing cycle.\nYou can only pause your subscription once per billing cycle, and once the pause begins, you will not be able to change the duration of the pause.\nYou

results and related reports for your informational, recreational, educational and research use.\nIf you have received a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, your AncestryDNA test may provide unexpected results because your saliva may contain cells with your DNA as well as cells with your donor\u2019s DNA.\nDNA for the test is extracted from the cells, and the combination of DNA sources can result in a failed test or a test that provides results based on your donor\u2019s DNA.\nTherefore, we recommend that those who have received a bone marrow or stem cell transplant do not take the

initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms or the Privacy Statement, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy Statement is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant

otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<u>No Class Actions</u>: <strong>You and Ancestry each agree that each party may only resolve disputes with the other on an individual basis and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.</strong> If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Changes to This Section</u>: Ancestry will provide thirty (30) days\u2019 notice of any changes affecting the substance of this section by posting notice of modifications to the Terms on the Services, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account.\nAmendments will become effective thirty (30)

CCPA.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Exercising Your Rights Under CCPA.\n</strong>The CCPA gives California consumers the right to request that we disclose what Personal Information we collect, use, disclose, or sell.\nThis includes the right to request the categories of Personal Information we have collected about them, the categories of sources of Personal Information, the business purpose for collecting Personal Information, the categories of third parties with whom we share categories of Personal Information, and the specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about the requestor.</p>\n<p>If you are submitting a request to know on your own behalf, there are two ways to make your request: online or by email.</p>\n<p>To submit your request to know online:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log into your Ancestry account.</li>\n<li>Go to your Account Settings.</li>\n<li>Click on \u201cHow do I download my account data?\u201d and follow those instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For your convenience, here are step-by-step instructions on how to download your account data.</p>\n<p>To email your request to know, email us at ccpasupport@ancestry.com.\nWe are required to verify your identity before providing you with a copy of your data.\nWe will require you to provide proof of identity and California address (e.g., you may be required to provide a copy of your government ID, which will be used solely to verify your identity and address).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please note</strong>: In response to a request to know under the CCPA, we will not provide unique biometric information to you.\nYour DNA Data belongs to you and you may download it at any time.\nIf you download your DNA Data, you do so at your own risk.\nLearn how here.</p>\n<p>If you are an \u201cAuthorized Agent\u201d pursuant to the CCPA and are submitting a request to know on behalf of one of our users, see Section 17.5.3 below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Right to Delete.\n</strong>The CCPA gives California consumers the right to request that we delete your Personal Information.</p>\n<p>If you are submitting a request to delete on your own behalf, there are two ways to make your request: online or by email.\nNote that to delete your Personal Information, you must delete your account and that once an account deletion request is completed, this process is irreversible.\nYour information (including, but not limited to, family trees, records, photos, DNA Data and AncestryHealth\u00ae results) will be permanently deleted.</p>\n<p>To submit your request for deletion online:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log into your Ancestry account.</li>\n<li>Go to your Account Settings.</li>\n<li>Click on \u201cHow do I delete my account?\u201d and follow those instructions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For your convenience, here are step-by-step instructions on how to delete your account.</p>\n<p>To email your request to delete, email

request to know on behalf of one of our users, see Section 17.5.3 below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Authorized Agents.\n</strong>The CCPA allows California residents to use \u201cauthorized agents\u201d to make requests to know and requests for deletion.\nTo use an authorized agent, email us at thirdpartyauthorizationrequests@ancestry.com.\nNote that even if a consumer chooses to use an authorized agent for a request, the consumer will still need to work directly with us to provide items 3 and 4 below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Proof that the authorized agent is registered with the Secretary of State to conduct business in California.</li>\n<li>Signed permission from the consumer allowing the authorized agent to act on the consumer\u2019s behalf.</li>\n<li>Verification of the consumer\u2019s identity (to be made directly by the consumer to us).\nWe will require proof of identity and California address (e.g., a copy of your government ID, which will be used solely to verify your identity and address).</li>\n<li>Confirmation that the consumer provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request to be confirmed directly by the consumer to us.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Please note</strong>: In response to a request to know under the CCPA, we will not provide unique biometric information about the consumer to an authorized agent or to the consumer.\nIf the consumer wants to download DNA Data, see Section 17.5.1 above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling.\n</strong>Ancestry does not sell your Personal Information, and has not sold it in the 12 months prior to the effective date of this California Statement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-discrimination.\n</strong>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.8&nbsp;&nbsp;California\u2019s Shine the Light Law.\n</strong>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the \u201cShine the Light\u201d law, permits Users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties.\nRequests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.\nUnder Section 1798.83, Ancestry currently does not share any Personal Information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.9&nbsp;&nbsp;Contact Us.\n</strong>If you have questions about our CCPA or California-related privacy policies or practices,
