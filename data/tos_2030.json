services, which helps us provide you with a more seamless experience across our Services.<br>\n&nbsp;</p> 2.\nInformation We Collect Through Automated Means <p>When you use our Services, we collect certain information as described in this Section.\nAs discussed further below, we and our service providers (which are third party companies that work on our behalf), may use a variety of

diagnostic and usage data by visiting the Privacy Policy &amp.\nSettings menu in the Bose Connect Application.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Location Information</strong>.\nWhen you use the Services, we and our service providers may automatically collect general location information (e.g., IP address, city/state and or postal code associated with an IP address) from your computer or mobile device.\nThis information allows us to enable access to content that varies based on a user\u2019s general location (e.g., providing access to local radio stations).</p>\n<p>We will ask your permission before

better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices.\nIf you wish to opt out of cross device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so through your Android or Apple device-based settings.</p> 3.\nInformation We Collect at Bose Retail Locations <p>We use a third-party service provider, RetailNext, to gather mobile and video analytics in Bose retail stores.\nThis service provider provides insights about consumers\u2019 behavior in and around Bose retail stores based on the collection of information from consumers\u2019 Wi-Fi\u00ae

information can be found in their privacy policy.\nMore information about the data we collect through RetailNext.</p>\n<p>At Bose retail locations or third-party retail locations that sell Bose

connections.<br>\n</p>\n<p>When you \u201clike\u201d or \u201cfollow\u201d us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or other social media sites, we may collect some information from you including your

Internet server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies.\nWe use these technologies in order to offer you a more tailored experience in the future, by understanding and remembering your particular browsing preferences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A web server log is a file where website activity is stored.</li>\n<li>An SDK is a set of tools and/or code that we embed in our applications and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Services.</li>\n<li>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer.\n(ii) store your preferences and settings.\n(iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited.\n(iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests.\n(v) perform searches and analytics.\nand (vi) assist

through cookies and similar tools.\nengage in auditing, research, or reporting.\nassist with fraud prevention.\nand provide certain features to you.\nTo prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.\nWe may also use Adobe Analytics to analyze and optimize the performance of our websites, advertising, and content.&nbsp;Learn more about Adobe\u2019s privacy practices and to make choices regarding Adobe\u2019s tracking activities.</p>\n<p>If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains.\nThis data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.</p> 2.\nOnline Advertising <p>The Services may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use.\nThe ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you.\nThese ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above.\nWe also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services.\nWe sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may \u201cmatch\u201d this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications.</p>\n<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties.\nIf you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.\nTo opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page.\nWe do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.\nWe are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p> 3.\nMobile Advertising <p>When using mobile applications from Bose or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements.\nWe may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications.\nEach operating system, e.g.\niOS for Apple phones and Android for Android devices, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.\nWe do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements.\nthus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.\nYou may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements.<br>\n</p> 4.\nNotice Concerning Do Not Track.\n<p>Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d)
