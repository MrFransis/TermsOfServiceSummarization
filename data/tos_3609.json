questions and assessments hosted here, are subject to the very broad license below and the rules in Paragraph 5.\nWe wish we could say \"everything else is public domain\", but it's not that simple!</p>\n<p>For purposes of these Terms of Service, the term \u201cContent\u201d includes, without limitation, assessments, questions, documents, information, data, text, photographs, videos, audio clips, written posts and comments, software, scripts, graphics, and interactive features generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the Website.\nFor the purposes of these

abide by and maintain all copyright notices, information, and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Website.</p>\n<p>Are you still reading? Awesome! Please bear with us a little longer as what follows might look as legal boilerplate but it's actually important.\nA treat is waiting for you at the end of the page.</p>Accounts, Premium Memberships, Payments, and School Partnerships<p>Because we want to ensure that you and your students\u2019 data is as safe as possible, Teacher accounts must register using an email address and must not be shared.\nCollaboration and Co-Teaching tools, amongst others, are available in team plans but are not permitted on free individual user plans.\nAll sharing of data will require approval from the Teacher or from a school administrator in the case of school Partnerships.\nIf a Partner school requests Formative to sync up with your Student Information System (SIS), Learning Management System (LMS), or other system in order to automatically create accounts, you may receive an email to obtain access to the account authorized by an administrator and created by Formative.\nDO NOT SHARE YOUR ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS! This could open up you and your school to potential legal issues if student data is incorrectly shared with someone that should not have access.</p>\n<p>School Partnerships are entered into between Formative and either a School or District that has legal authorization to Teacher and Student Data.\nSmall teams may self-serve directly on our site, but a Partnership will always require written permissions and guarantees from an authorized agent of the Local Education Agency (LEA).\nIf Formative learns that the signing person did not have authority in the LEA to sign the Partnership agreement, it reserves the right to terminate the Partnership and all Accounts.\nFormative also reserves the right to terminate any account which we think is being abused, violates our Terms of Service, creates undue risk for students, or creates issues for other educators in our system.</p>\n<p>Teachers may self-upgrade to a Premium Membership directly at www.goformative.com/upgrade at any time.\nA credit card is required to authorize payment at the beginning of the subscription.\nThis subscription may or may not begin with a trial period in which the card is not charged immediately.\nIf a trial period exists, the Teacher can cancel their subscription at any time by visiting www.goformative.com/profile/plans to avoid being charged.\nIf the plan is not cancelled by the first billing period, the card supplied will be charged according to the plan selected.\nBilling cycles are either monthly or annually, depending on what the account holder selects.\nYou can continue to cancel your plan any time at www.goformative.com/profile/plans.\nAny cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle.\nE.g.\nif your current period ends on the 15th of the month and you cancel on the 3rd, you will continue to have premium access for the remaining 12 days and your account will fully cancel on the 15th.\nNo refund will be issued.</p>\n<p>All payments for both individual Teacher subscriptions and School Partnerships are considered final and are not eligible for refund.\nThe only exception to this rule is that if an individual account is rolled into a School Partnership account that is overlapping and being paid for by an LEA, we may issue a pro-rated refund for the unused portion of the subscription period to avoid double payment of the time period by the LEA.\nIf you have any billing issues or questions, you must notify us in writing by email or support chat within 5 calendar days of the issue being addressed.\nAny billing issues older than 5 calendar days will not be considered.\nFormative does not store any credit card information.\nWe utilize the secure and vetted 3rd party system, Stripe (stripe.com), for our credit card payment processing and subscription services.</p>User Contributions and Content Standards.\nSpecial Disclaimer for legal content<p>Formative contains user generated content, and also may contain message boards, personal web pages, forums or other interactive features that allow you to upload, post, submit, publish, display or transmit to other Users Content on or through the Website.\nAll User Content must be lawful, not spammy, and clear of virus or other malware.\nMore specifically, but without limiting the foregoing, it must comply with the following Content Standards:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Not contain any material which is defamatory, obscene, indecent, abusive, offensive, harassing, violent, hateful, inflammatory or otherwise objectionable.</li>\n<li>Not promote sexually explicit or pornographic material, violence, or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age.</li>\n<li>Not infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual property rights of any other person.</li>\n<li>Not violate the legal rights (including the rights of publicity and privacy) of others or contain any material that could give rise to any civil or criminal liability under applicable laws or regulations or that otherwise may be in conflict with these Terms of Service.</li>\n<li>Not be likely to deceive any person.</li>\n<li>Not promote any illegal activity, or advocate, promote or assist any unlawful act.</li>\n<li>Not cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety or be likely to upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person.</li>\n<li>Not be used to impersonate any person, or to misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person or organization.</li>\n<li>Not involve commercial activities or sales , such as contests, sweepstakes and other sales promotions, barter or advertising.</li>\n<li>Not give the impression that they emanate from us or any other person or entity, if this is not the case.</li>\n<li>Not used, if public, as test empty documents with no actual content, or typing exercises: please respect our community and help us minimize the clutter!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As stated above, all the user generated legal documents are in the public domain, unless otherwise specified by the author.\nThe rest of the content (e.g.\nprivate documents, comments, description, guides, etc) is creative work, therefore covered by copyright.\nWe claim no intellectual property rights over the User Content.\nYour content remain yours.\nHowever, by setting your documents to be viewed publicly, or commenting in public, you agree to allow others to view, comment, edit and branch your content, and you grant us the right to use, copy, distribute and disclose to third parties the content for any purpose.</p>\n<p>User Content is not intended to replace official state testing or education guidelines at this time.\nUse of the Website should never be understood to be replacing use of official state testing or education entities, and Formative's relationship to all documents and transactions completed using the Website is that of a trusted, disinterested third party.</p>\n<p>Note also that this license to User Content continues even if you stop using the Services, primarily because of the social nature of Content shared through the Services - when you post something publicly, others may choose to use your materials, making your Content part of other\u2019s materials that cannot later be erased without retroactively censoring the speech of others.</p>Termination and Deletion:<p>On termination of your Account or upon your deletion of particular pieces of User Content from the Services, Formative shall make reasonable efforts to make any such non-public User Content inaccessible and cease use of it and to remove all personal information from our servers.\nhowever, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) caching of, copies of, or references to the User Content may not be immediately removed.\n(b) such removed Subscriber Content may persist in backups (not available to others) for a reasonable period of time.\nand (c) such removed User Content may be available (and stored on our servers) through the accounts of other Subscribers, such as because of cloning documents or shared assessment questions.</p>Law and Copyright Infringement<p>We do not undertake to review all material before it is posted on the Website, and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted.\nAccordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications or content provided by any user or third party.\nIn the unlikely event we receive a disclosure request from an authorized party, we reserve the right to disclose user identities when required to do so by the law, including in response to a law enforcement request supported by a valid court order.\nYou waive and hold harmless the Company from any claims resulting from any action taken by the Company during or as a result of its investigations and from any actions taken as a consequence of investigations by either the Company or law enforcement authorities.</p>\n<p>If you believe that any User Content violate your copyright, please follow the procedure set forth by article 512(c) of the DMCA and provide us a written takedown notice including the following information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>\n<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material.</li>\n<li>Information reasonably sufficient for us to contact you, such as email, address, telephone number.</li>\n<li>A statement that you a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the

decisions around your information.Formative collects the following information about you and your use of our Properties:Personal Information.<p>When you register for, browse and use our Properties, you may provide to Formative what is generally called \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d or \u201cpersonal data\u201d (such as your full name, email address, or a photograph of yourself) that can be used to identify you.\nAt Formative, we call this data \u201cPersonal Information\u201d.</p>Information from Integrated Services like Google or Clever.<p>If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party integrated service (what we call an \u201cIntegrated Service\u201d), such as Google, Formative may also collect Personal Information that is already associated with your Integrated Service account.\nYou may also have the option of sharing additional information with Formative through an Integrated Service.\nIf you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving Formative the permission to use, share, and store it in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>Information about your use of our Properties and other User-provided Information.<p>We may collect usage information about your use of certain features on our Properties, such as the number of questions students have attempted, the points students have received, and the academic concepts present in the assignments teachers create.\nThis enables us to better tailor educational experiences that are most appropriate for you and your students.</p>Information obtained from other Users.<p>We make available certain features on our Properties that allow other Users to provide us information about you.\nThis information may include Personal Information.\nGenerally, this occurs when parents or teachers provide information relating to a Student User.\nFor example, a parent may register an account for their child and provide us with certain information, such as the Child\u2019s first and last name.</p>Location Information.<p>We may collect and use information about your location (such as your city or school) to provide you with tailored educational experiences for your region, but we don\u2019t collect the precise geolocation of you or your device.\nYou may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to prevent it from providing us with any location information.</p>Information from Other Sources.<p>In certain situations, we may obtain information, including Personal Information, from third parties or sources other than our Properties.\nFor example, if you apply for a job with Formative via an online recruiting site, we will obtain the information you provide in your application for that purpose.\nIf we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Information that we collect through our Properties, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>Formative uses this information in the following ways:To enhance our Properties and the services we provide.<p>Formative uses the information you provide or that we collect to enhance our relationship with you and to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on our Properties.\nFormative, for instance, remembers your recent activity so we can recommend the most appropriate content for you on your next visit.\nIf you have given Formative consent, we may use your Personal Information to provide you with information about Formative\u2019s features, services and other offerings that may be of interest to you.\nUnder certain circumstances and if we obtain your consent (for example, if you submit a testimonial and agree to make it public), we may post your Personal Information on our Properties.</p>To understand how you and other Users use our Properties.<p>Formative uses all of the information that you provide or that we collect from Users to understand and analyze the usage trends, learning behaviors, and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Properties work and look, and to create new features and functionality.\nFor more information, please see the \u201cTechnologies\u201d section, below.</p>To enable your participation in Formative partnership arrangements.<p>Formative will not share Personal Information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.\nYou can grant us permission to share your Personal Information with authorized partners, not-for-profit organizations, and other entities that are not affiliated with Formative.\nIn these cases we will only provide to these third parties the information you have authorized or asked us to share to these third parties.</p>\n<p>Formative may send information or offers to you on behalf of these third parties.\nFor example, if we partner with a not-for-profit organization running a contest in your region and send you an email notifying you of the partnership, we will only share your information with the third party if you opt-in to participate in the contest, and if so, the information we would share would be limited to that needed to facilitate your participation in the contest and enable you to redeem your prize.</p>Data Retention.<p>A core part of our service is to relay data to school administrators and other authorized stakeholders.\nBecause of this, school organizations frequently need to look back at previously collected data, whether the User is still active or not.\nFor these purposes, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active, as is authorized by your school organization, or as is reasonably useful for your school organization\u2019s potential use.\nAn authorized school representative, or you if so authorized or using for personal reasons, may request deletion of your account and data by emailing privacy@goformative.com.\nIf the account is no longer active and the school organization has not requested the data within 10 years, we will purge your data.</p>Technical Information.<p>To provide a personalized learning and high-quality experience for our Users, we may use various technologies that automatically record certain technical information from your browser or device, including standard log files, web beacons, or pixel tags.\nThis technical information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device or browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, clickstream data, operating system, and the dates and times that you visit the Website.\nWe do this to better understand how our Users are using our Website so we can improve site functionality and the services we offer you.</p>\n<p>Like most websites, whether or not you are a registered

information you provide us.\nWe do not rent or sell Personal Information that we collect from Users with third parties.\nWe also take great measures to restrict any collection or disclosure of Personal Information from students.</p>Formative will disclose User information only as described below:If you want information shared with other Users, we\u2019ll share it for you.<p>We provide certain features that may allow you to share information with other Users.\nFor example, if you are a teacher, you may choose to populate your profile with your name, school, and the grades and subjects that you teach.\nOr you may ask questions that are visible to other Users of Formative.\nWhenever you share information with other Users of our Properties, any Personal Information that you choose to include in, or is associated with, such User Postings will be accessible by such Users.\nAs with most online services, once you make your Personal Information available to others in any of these ways, it may be collected and used by the recipients without restriction.</p>We may share data with third-party applications that you authorize.<p>In the future, Third-party application developers and service providers (commonly known as \u201cApp Developers\u201c) may build complementary services for our platform, such as a mobile application for visually-impaired learners to access our resources.\nYou may request we share your information with App Developers by connecting to the application or service and approving access to your Formative account.</p>We may share anonymous or aggregate data to improve our services and learn more about our Users.<p>In certain occasions, Formative may work with business partners to improve our services or offerings.\nWe may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate non-Personal Information to authorized business partners to conduct research on online education or assist in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, promotions, and/or functionality on our Properties.</p>We may share identifiable data with research organizations to improve our services and learn more about our Users for research purposes.<p>To better understand how we can improve Formative for our Users, we may share automatically collected data about how you use Formative with independent research organizations for the purposes of research only.\nOur research partners must abide by strict ethical standards when working with your data, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Strict data privacy standards.</strong> If the research must use personally identifiable data, such as names and email addresses, the research team will keep this information in a secure, password protected database saved on a secure server.\nFor all analyses, personally identifiable data will be removed from analytic files and the research partner will instead use a study assigned research ID to identify different Formative Users.\nOnly the research study team will have access to these data for research purposes only (e.g.\ninviting you to participate in an online survey).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Secure data transfer protocols.</strong> If we need to share your data with a research partner, we will use encrypted files before transfer and adhere to strong password and password transfer procedures.\nWe will use a Secure Shell (SSH) or secure file transfer protocols (SFTP) to share the data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Strict data destruction policies.</strong> Upon completion of the research project, all personally identifiable data will be destroyed by the independent researchers within 60 days.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Strict reporting standards that do not endanger User privacy.</strong> Any publications (infographics, reports, research papers, etc.) that result from this research will not identify you or your school in any way.\nResults will be reported in aggregate, and researchers will follow federal masking guidelines.\nOur research partners will never disclose any personally identifiable information to anyone outside of the project.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Review of all research activities by an Institutional Review Board (IRB).</strong> All research conducted by third party research partners will be reviewed by IRBs.\nThe purpose of this review board is to determine if planned research studies will meet high ethical standards with a focus on protecting your data.\nResearch will only be conducted if the IRB approves the research plan.\nIf you are concerned that your data will be used in a study by our partners, you may contact us at privacy@goformative.com and we will provide you with IRB contact information for all studies involving your data.<p>\n</p>\n<p>If your data is used in research, you have the right to contact the research team and ask questions.\nIf you would like to know if your data has been used for research purposes, please contact us at privacy@goformative.com.\nAll research we engage in is designed to be low risk, meaning that there are little to no risk of your identity being revealed or of discomfort to you.\nYou may benefit by allowing researchers to examine your data, because our goal in conducting research is to make a better, easier to use, and more effective product with the ultimate goal of improving teaching and learning.\nYour data helps us better understand where we can improve.</p>\n<p>By agreeing to the Terms of Service, you agree to allow us to share your personally identifiable data to research organizations who follow the above criteria.\nIf you do not wish your data to be used for research purposes, please email us at privacy@goformative.com and we will make sure that no one outside of Formative may see your data.\nYou may withdraw permission for your data to be used for research purposes at any time without penalty or loss of any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled, by emailing privacy@goformative.com.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>We will share data when required by law.<p>Formative may also disclose User information if required to do so by law, or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with local, state, federal, international, or other applicable laws (such as U.S.\nCopyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant, or administrative request.\nIn some cases, we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to Users.</p>We may share data in the context of a change of business, including a merger or acquisition.<p>In the event that Formative is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we may transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.\nWe will only transfer this information in one of the following cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Successor Entity does not reduce our security and privacy practices with regards to student data.\nOne way to achieve this is through the entity similarly signing the Student Data Privacy Pledge.</li>\n<li>If, after we send a notice telling Users of the sale and potential transfer of data and giving them the option to deny the data transfer, a User has not replied within 15 days.</li>\n</ul>If both of the two above scenarios do not hold true, we will not transfer your data.We may share data when necessary or appropriate to protect Formative or others.<p>Formative may disclose information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability.\nto protect Formative from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses.\nto investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations.\nto assist government enforcement agencies.\nto protect the security or integrity of our Properties.\nor to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Formative, our Users, or others.</p>Limitations on Access to your Personal Information by Employees and Authorized Parties.<p>Formative\u2019s employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to access Personal Information you provide to Formative.\nWe may share your Personal Information with third-party service providers, including outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities, but they may only use your Personal Information to provide us with a specific service and not for any other purpose.\nWhere feasible, Formative will require our third-party service providers to comply with this Privacy Policy.</p>General Policies on Working with Third Parties<p>When dealing with Third Parties in any data transfer context mentioned above, we will only do so if they adhere to similar privacy policies to ourselves, safeguarding student data at a similar or definitively same level to the Student Data Privacy Pledge.</p>Your choice and options in our data collection, use, and transferYou can choose to not provide us with Personal Information.<p>You may always decline to share your Personal Information with Formative.\nRegistration is not required to access many portions of our Properties.\nIf you decline to register, however, Formative will not be able to provide to you certain features and functionalities found on our Properties.\nYou may later enable or access those features by providing Formative with the necessary Personal Information.</p>You can edit or delete Personal Information in our records.<p>We want you to have access to your information, so that you can help keep it as accurate as possible.\nIf you register and provide Formative with Personal Information, you may update your account and information at any time by reviewing your profile information.\nTo delete your account permanently or make other changes, email support@goformative.com.\nParents can modify or delete Student User accounts.\nIf you experience any difficulties in this process, please contact us as described below.</p>You can disconnect us from Integrated Services.<p>You may revoke Formative\u2019s access to your account on any Integrated Service, such as Google, at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Integrated Service.\nYou should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service.\nPlease review each Integrated Service\u2019s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Properties.</p>If you approve the collection of Personal Information, you may provide the following:<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Nickname (what your students call you)</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>School/Organization</li>\n<li>Position at your School/Organization</li>\n<li>Grades and Subjects Taught</li>\n<li>Names of your Classes/Sections</li>\n<li>Student Names/Emails/Usernames</li>\n<li>Names and Emails of Colleagues (if referring or inviting to team plan)</li>\n</ul>Exceptions for StudentsThe policies above apply to all Users, with exceptions for how we handle student data listed here.<ul>\n<li>We will never provide behaviorally targeted ads to students</li>\n<li>We will not provide personal information with other third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use, even if consent were given, which we won\u2019t ask for.</li>\n</ul>Extra Information for Student UsersFormative is committed to children\u2019s privacy.<p>Different regions require extra precautions for creation of student accounts and handling of student data under certain ages.\nIn the United States, COPPA requires extra restrictions for students under the age of 13.\nSimilarly in many EU countries under GDPR, precautions are required under 13, 14, 15, or 16 years of age, depending on each country\u2019s individual rules.\nBecause of this, we take the same level of care to student accounts regardless of age or location.</p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to Formative.\nFor that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect Personal Information relating to all students creating accounts on our site (\u201cStudent Users\u201d).\nFormative also seeks parental consent for all Student Users\u201d.\nIf you are a parent or guardian (\u201cParent\u201d) and discover that your child has a registered account with our Properties without your consent, please alert Formative at privacy@goformative.com and request that we delete that child\u2019s personal information from our systems.</p>\n<p>In most cases, we will have to reach out to the educator and/or school overseeing the account to confirm identities before we can make changes to a student account at the parent\u2019s direction.</p>How children may register for and use our Properties.<p>A child can be registered to use the Properties through his or her school, or through an integration with the Properties that is supported by the child\u2019s school, or by teachers, tutors and other similar adults who assist in the educational process (\u201cTeachers\u201d) who have taken steps to obtain parental consent.\nParents always have the option to delete their Student User\u2019s account by contacting privacy@goformative.com.</p>\n<p>Children must always sign up as a Student during the account creation process, never as a Teacher.</p>\n<p>If a Student User attempts to register for our Properties, Formative will request an Authorization Code, which must be created and provided by their Teacher.\nTeachers must not give these codes to or create accounts for children unless they have the authority to give consent for the sharing of that student's personal information (name, email, answers, etc).\nAgain, we will never sell student data.\nIt is up to the Teacher and Student to determine if and how this information is shared.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you are a Parent, you may provide consent for your child\u2019s registration via email.\nParents may revoke a child\u2019s permission to use the Properties by emailing privacy@goformative.com to delete the account.</p>Restrictions on Student Users.<p>Formative attempts to restrict a Student User\u2019s access to certain features that could result in disclosure of Personal Information by the Student User.\nA restricted account limits sharing and displaying private information about the Student User in various ways, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The profile is not shared publicly, and only the Parent and other permitted Teachers can see the User\u2019s profile</li>\n<li>The Student User cannot post to public discussion forums</li>\n<li>The Parent can edit Personal Information found in the restricted account by emailing privacy@goformative.com</li>\n<li>The Parent can remove Student Users from view of any Teachers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some other features of our Properties may, however, permit a Student User to enter free-form text through which the Student User could enter Personal Information that would be visible to other Users.\nThis may occur, for instance, if a Student User enters Personal Information in answering an exercise problem or creating other projects on our Properties.\nIf you are the Parent of a Student User, please advise your Student User of the risks of posting Personal information on our Properties or any other online services, as information posted may be used by others without restriction.</p>\n<p>As a Parent, you can choose to share information about your child as you deem appropriate.\nFormative won\u2019t share Personal Information about your child or his/her progress with anyone other than you, your child and any permitted Teachers, unless we receive your permission (or as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy).</p>California Children\u2019s Privacy Rights<p>If you are under the age of 18, or the parent of a User under the age of 18, residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content or information you have posted on our Properties.\nIf you would like to request removal of your or your child\u2019s content or information, please email us at privacy@goformative.com for assistance, or you can delete specific information (or delete your or your child\u2019s account) directly.\nPlease note that removal of your content or information does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal, as there may be deidentified or recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some form.\nAdditionally, we will not remove content or information that we may be required to retain under applicable federal and state laws.</p>Our approach to Data SecurityData security is important to you, and to us.<p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information.\nFor example, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information to confirm your identity, and we may require that you create and use a password to access certain parts of our Properties.\nYou should create and maintain a strong password to help ensure the security of your account.</p>We try to ensure that our Properties and information sent to us are safe, but no security measures are perfect.<p>Formative uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information and other information we maintain in connection with our Properties.\nWe cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the information you transmit to Formative, and you do so at your own risk.\nOnce we receive your transmission of information, Formative makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.\nWhen you enter sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies.\nHowever, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>We will notify you electronically or via the Properties if Formative experiences a data security incident that could affect you.<p>If we learn of a data security incident that compromises or appears to compromise your Personal Information, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.\nWe may also post a notice on our Properties if a data security incident occurs.</p>\n<p>We will notify each educational agency with which we have a contract, of any breach or unauthorized release of personally identifiable information in the most expedient way possible and without unreasonable delay but no more than seven calendar days after the discovery of such breach.</p>How we maintain data integrity<p>At Formative, we only use Personal Information as needed for the purposes for which it was collected or where you have consented to our use of Personal Information relating to you.\nWe take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we store and use is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.\nIf you discover that Personal Information or other data pertaining to you is inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date, please update your account information or contact us as outlined below.</p>Links to other sites<p>The Properties may link to and may be linked by websites operated by other entities or individuals.\nSome of these websites, such as the Formative Facebook page, may be co-branded with our name or logo.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot always control the activities of, such other third-party websites.\nYou should consult the respective privacy policies of those third-party websites.</p>International visitors<p>Our Properties are operated and managed on servers located within the United States.\nIf you choose to use our Properties from other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that differ from U.S.\nlaw, then you acknowledge and agree that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of those regions to the United States and that, by providing your Personal Information on the Properties, you consent to that transfer.</p>\n<p>In some special requirements, we may be able to create and manage isolated servers outside of the United States based on specific international partnerships.\nPlease contact us at privacy@goformative.com regarding this requirement.</p>Changes and updates to this Privacy Policy<p>Formative may modify or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nFormative will notify Users of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the revised Privacy Policy with an updated date of revision on our Properties.\nWe will not change how we use any Personal Information in any material way without also providing notice of the change via email to you (or in the case of a Student User, to your Teacher or Parent) or through the Properties, and obtaining consent to any new uses.</p>Additional State ProvisionsCalifornia<p>Formative will not use your data for any purpose beyond the indicated purposes in the Terms of Service, which includes this Privacy Policy.\nThis
