to you through the Services.\nPlease also see Section 14 below for additional terms applicable to your payment obligations.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Pharmacy Services.</b> If you receive a prescription as a

instructions that accompany the kit to register your kit, collect the applicable biological sample(s), complete any required documentation, and return such biological samples and documentation to the applicable laboratory that performs the testing (the \u201c<b>Lab</b>\u201d).\nFailure to follow the instructions may result in your samples not being processed by the Lab.</p>\n<p>The Lab sends the results of the tests to the Reviewing Provider who releases the test results to us.\nWe provide the test results to you via the Services.\nYou understand and agree that it is your responsibility to bring your results to your primary health care provider for interpretation and to inform decisions made about your health and treatment.</p>Registration and Account Creation<p>Although certain parts

ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM RO.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND RO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Governing Law.</b> These Terms of Use and your use of the Services shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws.\nSubject to the requirement to arbitrate set forth in this Section 16, exclusive jurisdiction for all disputes that do not require arbitration will be the state and federal courts located in New York, New York, and you consent to the jurisdiction of those courts.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Binding Arbitration, Generally.</b> Except as described in the \u201c<b>Exceptions</b>\u201d section below, you and Ro agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms of Use, the Services, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nThis agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, fraud, misrepresentation, common law, constitutional provision, respondeat superior, agency or any other legal or equitable theory, regardless of whether a claim arises after the termination of these Terms of Use, and regardless of whether a claim arises before or after the effective date of these Terms of Use.\nAny dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Exceptions.</b> Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms of Use will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.\n(b) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\nor (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in a state or federal court in New York, New York.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitrator.</b> This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<b>AAA</b>\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, \u201c<b>AAA Rules</b>\u201d) as modified by these Terms of Use.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Ro.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Commencing Arbitration.</b> Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.\nMail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (\u201c<b>Notice of Arbitration</b>\u201d).\nRo\u2019s address for Notice is: Roman Health Ventures Inc., 116 W.\n23rd Street, 4th Floor, New York, New York, 10011 Attention: General Counsel.\nA copy of all Notices of Arbitration must also be sent to Ro via email to arbitration-notices@ro.co.\nThe Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim.\n(b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (c) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<b>Demand</b>\u201d).\nThe parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Ro may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nIf you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Ro will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if Ro has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and Ro may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration Proceedings.</b> Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your billing address unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a telephonic or video hearing.\nor (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Ro must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration Relief.</b> Except as provided in the \u201c<b>No Class Actions</b>\u201d section below, the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be final and binding on all parties.\nJudgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>No Class Actions.</b> YOU AND RO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Ro agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Limited Time to File Claims.</b> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR RO WANTS TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER THAT IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS OF USE, THEN YOU OR RO MUST COMMENCE SUCH DISPUTE BY DELIVERY OF A NOTICE OF ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Severability.</b> All parts of these Terms of Use apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nRo and you both agree that if we cannot enforce a part of this contract as written, then that part will be replaced with terms that most closely match the intent of the part we cannot enforce, to the extent permitted by law.\nThe invalidity of part of these Terms of Use will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.\nThe section headings are for convenience only and do not have any force or effect.</p>17.\nCommunications by Text Message and Email<p>By opting-in to receive text (SMS) messages from Ro or by sending Ro an initial text message (an \u201c<b>SMS Enrollment</b>\u201d), you consent to receiving text messages regarding your Ro

type of text message from Ro, you will need to opt-out of each Ro SMS service to which you are subscribed.\nUntil you have done so, you may continue to receive the types of text messages from Ro that you have opted-in to receive but have not unsubscribed from.</p>\n<p>You also understand that while Ro takes your privacy and the security of your health and other sensitive information very seriously, the transmission of information over the internet and mobile networks is not 100% secure.\nText messages and emails that you send to or receive from Ro are not encrypted, which means that

own risk.\nBy initiating an SMS Enrollment, you consent to sending text messages to Ro, and receiving text messages from Ro, that are not encrypted.\nLikewise, by emailing Ro or giving Ro your email,

provider.</p>18.\nMiscellaneous Terms<p>\n<b>No waiver.</b> No waiver by Ro of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure by Ro to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>\n<p>\n<b>No agency relationship.</b> Neither these Terms of Use, nor any Services Content, materials or features of the Services create any partnership, joint venture, employment, or other agency relationship between us and you.\nYou may not enter into any contract on our behalf or bind us in any way.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Remedies.</b> You agree that any violation, or threatened violation, by you of these Terms of Use constitutes an unlawful and unfair business practice that will cause us irreparable and unquantifiable harm.\nYou also agree that monetary damages would be inadequate for such harm and consent to our obtaining any injunctive or equitable relief that we deem necessary or appropriate.\nThese remedies are in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Assignment.</b> You may not assign any of your rights under these Terms of Use, and any such attempt will be null and void.\nRo and its affiliates may, in their individual discretion, transfer, without further consent or notification, all contractual rights and obligations pursuant to these Terms of Use if some or all of the business of Ro is transferred to another entity by way of merger, sale of its assets, or otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Notice for California Users.</b> If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code \u00a71542, which

ultimately improve the way that people interact with the medical system when addressing certain health conditions.\nThis document serves as the universal code of conduct for physician use of the Ro platform.\nOur goal is to align the values and philosophies of Ro HQ and the physicians who practice on the Ro Platform.\nThis Code of Conduct will continue to be updated based on feedback from affiliated physicians in order to ensure patients are always receiving the highest quality of care.\n</p>\n<b>BEST PRACTICES ON THE PLATFORM</b>\n<b>Be Patient:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Telemedicine is a new experience for many patients.\nThey may ask questions that seem obvious (e.g., \u201cHow does telemedicine work?\u201d).\nPlease be sensitive to their concerns and work with them to determine the best course of treatment.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Always Explain:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Always provide a detailed explanation to a patient whether you find it appropriate to write a prescription or not.\nPatients are coming to the Ro Platform because they are in need of your guidance and care.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Follow Up:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ro Platform will automatically follow up with patients who receive treatment plans after 2 weeks, 1 month, and every 3 months thereafter.\nIf you think that a patient needs additional follow up, you can automate follow ups in the messaging system or contact the Ro Medical Ops Team.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Document: </b>\n<ul>\n<li>Always thoroughly document your decisions.\nFor example, if you approve a patient for treatment, and the Ro system flagged one or several of their responses as a potential contraindication or risk, please make sure to document your rationale (e.g., you spoke to them via phone, video, or message and received additional clarifying information).\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Check-in: </b>\n<ul>\n<li>The physicians with the highest rate of patient satisfaction check their messages at least once per day.\nIf you will be unavailable for more than 48 hours, please give the Ro Medical Ops one week notice so that we can ensure your patient\u2019s receive timely responses to any question.\nIn case of an emergency, please try to notify us as soon as possible.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>CONDUCT EXPECTATIONS ON THE PLATFORM</b>\n<b>Verify Identity:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>ID &amp.\nPhoto Match: The first step by any physician is to confirm the identity of the patient and ensure that the image uploaded matches the patient\u2019s government ID.\nThis is also double-checked by automated software.\n</li>\n<li>Personal Information: After you\u2019ve confirmed the ID matches the Face Photo, confirm that the basic information entered during the online visit (i.e., first name, last name, DOB) matches the information on the government ID.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Follow State Protocols:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ro Platform will always require you to confirm that you established a patient-physician relationship according to the state-specific requirement.\nNever provide any medical advice or treatment until you have adequately established a patient-physician relationship.\nWhen in doubt, please contact the Ro Medical Operations team or Ro\u2019s General Counsel.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Treat \u201cOldest\u201d First:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Please always treat patients who entered the Ro Platform first.\nWe pride ourselves on providing timely service to our patients.\nThis can only be done if those who have been waiting longer are served first.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>One at a time:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>If another physician has started to treat a patient, do not attempt to provide additional treatment unless specifically asked for a second opinion.\n</li>\n<li>In addition, physicians should complete only one consult at a time before moving on to the next patient.\nEach consultation requires your undivided attention.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>SAFETY, SECURITY &amp.\nPRIVACY</b>\n<b>Drug Interactions: </b>\n<ul>\n<li>Always pay attention to reported medications and be alert to drug interactions.\nPlease make sure to always check a patient\u2019s previous plans on the Ro Platform before making a treatment decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>When There\u2019s Doubt, There is No Doubt:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>When in doubt about a specific drug interaction, please contact the Ro Medical Ops team, who will route your question to one of Ro\u2019s clinical directors.</li>\n<li>If anything is unclear from the visit, please follow up with the patient.\nIt is always better to be 100% certain that you have all the necessary information.</li>\n<li>Never create a prescription for a patient if you are unsure if it\u2019s safe.\nIt is always better to get a second opinion or refer the patient to his/her in-person primary physician when in doubt.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Pay Attention to Underlying Causes: </b>\n<ul>\n<li>Our patients\u2019 mental health is as important to us as their physical health.\nAlways follow up with patients who provide answers concerning their mental health.\nPlease refer to the Emergency Plan located in the Roman Manuals and Protocols folder for guidance on how to respond if a patient is experiencing a medical emergency.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Consistently Review Protocols:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Please reference the condition-specific Physician Protocols regularly.\nThey contain the most important points on safe practices on the Ro Platform and should serve as a continuous reference for physicians.\nMost importantly, all medical decisions should be made solely at your discretion according to the standard of care.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Never Share:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Never share your Ro physician app password with anyone.</li>\n<li>Never share any patient information with anyone outside of Ro and only share information that is required for someone to complete their job.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Secure PHI:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Never share PHI using any software tool that is not HIPAA compliant.\nYou may use password protected links to patient charts in Asana and email.</li>\n<li>Never work on the platform in open areas where someone may be able to see your screen and see PHI.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>ETHICAL EXPECTATIONS FOR PLATFORM PHYSICIANS</b>\n<p>Ro-affiliated physicians are expected to uphold the highest ethical standards called upon by the medical profession.\n</p>\n<b>Do No Harm:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>First, do no harm.\nThe practice of medicine is a calling.\nAlways put your patients\u2019 safety first.\nPatient safety is the first and primary priority.\nYou will always be compensated the exact same, regardless of whether a prescription is written.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<b>No Self-Referral:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Patients that come through the Ro Platform should never be self referred to your own practice.\nIf a referral is needed, please refer them to their primary healthcare provider or other outside physician.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Sound Body &amp.\nSound Mind: </b>\n<ul>\n<li>Never engage in the practice of medicine on our platform while under the influence of alcohol or other mind-altering substances.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Keep Ro Informed:</b>\n<ul>\n<li>In case of a board complaint, hospital administrative action, malpractice suit or judgement, or any other administrative or disciplinary action against you (including a criminal charge or conviction related or unrelated to the practice of medicine), please promptly notify the Ro Medical Operations Team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Tzvi Doron</p>\n<p>Owner, Roman Pennsylvania Medical, P.C.\n</p>\n<p>Clinical
