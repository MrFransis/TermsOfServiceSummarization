info@drawar.io<br>You can contact our Data Protection Officer at info@drawar.io <br>In this Privacy and Cookie Notice, we describe how we use cookies and process data, including personal data, when you visit a website that is part of our network.\n<br>We are committed to lawful, fair, and transparent processing of personal data, adhering to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u201cJUST THE BASICS\u201d</b>\n<br>Which data do we process when you use our sites and apps?\n<br>When you play a game or watch a video, we process information about these activities.\n<br>This includes information such as IP addresses, which games you played, advertising IDs, general browser and device information like the brand and type, and country.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Why do we process this data?</b>\n<br>We process data in order to:\n<br>- Deliver ads that more accurately reflect your interests.\n<br>- Perform analytics to see how you and other players use our sites and/or apps.\nThis helps us provide you with more useful customised content.\n<br>- For example, we can offer you more relevant games and select new games based on what\u2019s popular.\n<br>- Provide social media functionality.\nThis means that you can easily share games, high-scores, and other content from drawar.io.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Who can give consent?</b>\n<br>You need to be 16 years or older to give consent.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>What are my rights?</b>\n<br>You have the right to request access to your personal data.\nYou also have the right to:\n<br> - Rectify incorrect personal data, or, when certain circumstances apply, to erase it.\n<br> - Restrict or object to the processing of your personal data.\n<br> - Receive your data so that you can use it elsewhere (data portability).\n</p>\nWhere we process data on the basis of your consent, you also have the right to withdraw your consent for future processing at any time.\nPlease go click here to change your consent settings.\n<p>\n<b>Who do we share data with?</b>\n<br> We allow a limited number of advertising, analytics, and social media companies to also place cookies and/or collect your data via drawar.io.\nYou can see a detailed list below.\nUnder certain circumstances, other third parties may also place cookies and/or collect your data.\nHowever, we can\u2019t know beforehand which third parties this may involve.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\u201cALL THE DETAILS\u201d</b>\n<br>drawar.io and third parties process personal data mostly with the help of cookies.\nTo help you understand what this means, we will first describe the use of cookies on our website below.\n<br>We will then explain how personal data is processed, including the use of those cookies.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.How do we use cookies?</b>\n<br>Cookies are small pieces of information (small files) stored on your equipment (such as your computer).\nAs the website owner, we place cookies when you visit our website, as do the third-parties that we work with directly to deliver games and ads.\nWhile we control this process, you can use our consent tool to make choices about the cookies you wish to allow and the personal data processing that occurs with the help of those cookies.\n<br>Because of the way online games and ads work, third parties with whom we do not work directly, but who also deliver games and ads via our website, may also place cookies.\nThis is not something we can control.\n<br>Below we describe which cookies drawar.io uses, for what purpose, and the duration of their use.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.1 Cookies that help to ensure that the website functions properly</b>\n<br>Our website uses cookies:\n<br>- to remember information you enter when you fill in forms or input fields on various pages.\nWe do this so that you won\u2019t have to enter all of this information again the next time you visit.\n<br>- to store preferences such as language settings, location settings, the number of search results you wish to display per page, etc.\n<br>- to store settings for optimal (video) display, such as the optimal or desired buffer size and information regarding your screen resolution.\n<br>- to read your browser settings, ensuring that our website is displayed properly on your screen.\n<br>- to detect abuse of our website and services, for instance by registering repeated failed attempts to log in.\n<br>- to ensure an even load (page requests) across the website, allowing us to keep the website available to our visitors.\n<br>- to offer the option to store login details so that you do not have to log in manually the next time you visit the website.\n<br>- to enable you to interact with our website in a whole range of different ways, such as social media interaction, or leaving direct feedback.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.2 Cookies allowing us to sell and show ads</b>\n<br>Most of our domains/games are provided free of charge.\nAdvertising income is used to cover the costs.\nThis means that ads are a vital source of income, and are necessary to keep the domains running.\nSome advertisements (or videos) use cookies.\nThese ads are placed on our websites by us and/or media companies and advertising networks.\nAdvertising networks and media companies function as a middleman between us as the website owner and advertisers.\n<br>These cookies ensure that it is possible to:\n<br>- track which ads you have already seen, and prevent you from being shown the same ad over and over again.\n<br>- track how many visitors click on an advertisement, so that we can balance the books with advertisers.\n<br>- track how many orders are placed via the ads, so that we can balance the books with advertisers.\n<br>Please note that you will still be shown advertisements even if these cookies are not used.\nAfter all, we also display ads that do not use cookies.\nFor more information regarding the cookies used by these advertising networks and the data these parties collect using those cookies, we refer you to the terms and conditions / privacy policies applicable to these platforms as listed on their own websites.\nPlease see the advertising networks websites listed and linked below to view the terms and conditions / privacy policies that may apply.\nPlease note, however, that these terms and conditions / privacy policies may be subject to change without notice.\n<br>We do not have any influence on these separate terms and conditions.\n<br>- Improve Digital\n<br>-

our website</b>\n<br>To find out which sections of our website our visitors like best, we continually try to measure how many visitors our website attracts and which pages they view most often.\nTo do this, we use our own cookies and/or those provided by third parties.\nThe information we gather in this manner is used to generate statistics.\nThese statistics provide us with insights into how often visitors come to our web pages, which pages they spend the most time viewing, how often they interact with (part of) a page, and so on.\nThis allows us to make the structure, navigation, and content of our website as user-friendly as possible.\nWe do not trace our statistics and other reports back to individual people.\n<br>We use cookies to:\n<br>- keep track of the number of visitors on our webpages.\n<br>- keep track of the amount of time visitors spend on our webpages.\n<br>- determine the order in which a visitor views the various pages belonging to our website.\n<br>- determine which parts of our website (or pages) need to be adjusted.\n<br>- optimise the website (or parts of it).\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.4 Cookies used to increase the relevance of the content of the website</b>\n<br>We aim to provide our visitors with relevant information.\nThat is why we work to tailor our website to each visitor\u2019s needs and interest.\nIn order to adjust the website to reflect your interests more accurately, we try to get an impression of the things you like based on the websites you have previously visited.\nIn doing so, we do not construct a profile that can be traced to any individual person.\nWe tailor the content and the ads shown on our website to different groups of visitors.\nOn the basis of your online history, you may be put into a certain category, such as \u201cwomen aged 35-45, married, with children, interested in ballet\u201d.\n<br>This group will, of course, be shown different ads than the group \u201cmen aged 20-30, unmarried, interested in cooking\u201d.\nThird parties (advertisers) who place cookies via our website may use similar technologies to find out what interests you.\nIn this case, information about your current visit to the website may be combined with information from earlier visits to other websites besides our own.\nWhen such cookies are not used, this does not mean that you will no longer be shown any ads on our websites.\nInstead, the ads will just be less likely to match your interests.\n<br>These cookies make it possible:\n<br>- for websites to register your visit in order to try to guess what you might be interested in.\n<br>- to register whether you clicked on an advertisement (i.e.\nclick-through behaviour).\n<br>- to pass on information about your browsing behaviour to other websites.\n<br>- to use services provided by third parties to display ads (re-targeted marketing).\n<br>- to show more interesting ads based on your social media usage (i.e.\nsocial media behaviour).\n<br>For more information regarding the cookies used by these advertising networks and the data these parties collect using those cookies, we refer you to the terms and conditions / privacy policies applicable to these platforms as listed on their own websites.\nPlease see the advertising networks websites listed and linked below to view the terms and conditions / privacy policies that may apply.\n(Please note, however, that these terms and conditions / privacy policies may be subject to change without notice.) <br>We do not have any influence on these separate terms and conditions.\n<br>- Improve Digital\n<br>- OpenX\n<br>-

that we do not always have insight into the cookies that third parties place via our website.\nThis is especially the case if our web pages contain so-called embedded elements.\nThese are games that are stored with another party, but which are shown on, in, or via our website.\nIf you encounter cookies on this website that fall into this category, and do not correspond to the previous categories described above, please let us know.\nYou can also contact the third party directly and ask which cookies they place on your device, why they do this, and what personal data they process with the cookie.\nYou may also wish to ask what the lifespan of the cookie is and what safeguards they have taken to protect your privacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.\nHow does drawar.io use personal

buyers, such as advertisers, brands, media agencies, and other intermediaries, although not all buyers receive the same data.\nThe list of buyers changes on a continuing basis, and for this reason we cannot include a comprehensive list here.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.2 Transfer of your personal data</b>\n<br>If you are an EU resident, would like to inform you that we may transfer your personal data from your home country to other countries and organizations.\nWhen we transfer this data, we will do so only when we have put in place appropriate safeguards (you can obtain more information about these

reserve the right to store the data we need to meet our legal and internal audit requirements.\n<br>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nRevoke consent for drawar.io cookies and data processing</b>\n<br>\nYou have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, but we would like to point out that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing before the date that you withdraw your consent.\nTo revoke your consent, please click here\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.\nAdditional information</b>\n<br>\nWe use third-party advertising
