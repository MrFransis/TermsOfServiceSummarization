you\nmay assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.\nThe Federal\nArbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to\nArbitrate section (this \"Agreement to Arbitrate\").</p>\n<p>1.\nProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and\nNon-Individualized Relief</p>\n<p>YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE\nOTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY\nPURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND US\nAGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE\nPERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A\nCONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY\nAWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN\nFAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY\nTO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).\nANY RELIEF\nAWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OUR OTHER USERS.</p>\n<p>2.\nArbitration Procedures</p>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nThere\nis no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is\nvery limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on\nan individual basis that a court can award to an individual.\nAn arbitrator\nshould apply the terms of this Agreement as a court would.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or\nagency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or\nrelating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of\nthis Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of this Agreement including,\nbut not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to\nArbitrate or this Agreement is void or voidable.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration\nAssociation (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the\nAAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable),\nas modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nThe AAA's rules are available at\nwww.adr.org.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the\nAAA's site at http://www.adr.org.</p>\n<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you\nreside or at another mutually agreed location.\nIf the value of the relief\nsought is $10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration\nconducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election\nshall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to\nrequire an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.\nAttendance at an\nin-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the\narbitrator requires otherwise.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in\naccordance with the laws of the State of Florida, including recognized\nprinciples of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving\nour other users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the\nsame user to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe arbitrator's award\nshall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator\nmay be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<p>3.\nCosts of Arbitration</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees\nwill be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement\nto Arbitrate.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your\nrequest, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated\nwith the arbitration.\nAny request for payment of fees by us should be submitted\nby mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and we will make arrangements\nto pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the value of the relief\nsought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of\narbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will\npay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the\narbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being\ncost-prohibitive.\nIn the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you\nassert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all\nfees associated with the arbitration paid by us on your behalf, which you\notherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>\n<p>4.\nSeverability</p>\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 1 of\nthis Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative\nActions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides\nthat any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the\nother parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\nIf an arbitrator\nor court decides that any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to\nArbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and\nNon-Individualized Relief\") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety\nof this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.\nThe remainder of the\nAgreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to apply.</p>\n<p>5.\nFuture Changes to the Agreement to Arbitrate</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the\ncontrary, you and we agree that if we make any change to this Agreement to\nArbitrate (other than a change to any notice address or site link provided\nherein) in the future, that change shall not apply to any claim that was filed\nin a legal proceeding against us prior to the effective date of the change.\nThe\nchange shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to\nArbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and us.\nWe will notify you\nof changes to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on our Services\nat least 30 days before the effective date of the changes and/or by email.</p>\n<p>Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes</p>\n<p>Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the\nAgreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular\nclaim or dispute as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order,\nyou agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you\nand us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Palm\nBeach County, Florida.\nYou and us agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction\nof the courts located within Palm Beach County, Florida for the purpose of\nlitigating all such claims or disputes.\nYou also agree that: (i) our Services\nshall be deemed solely based in the State of Florida.\nand (ii) our Services\nshall be deemed passive Services that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction\nover us and our assigns, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other\nthan the State of Florida.</p>\n<p>Miscellaneous.\nIf any portion of this Agreement is deemed\nunlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent\njurisdiction, this Agreement as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or\nunenforceable, but only that portion of this Agreement that is unlawful, void\nor unenforceable shall be stricken from this Agreement.</p>\n<p>The headings contained in
