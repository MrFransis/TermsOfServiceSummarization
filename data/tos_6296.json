information using \u201ccookies.\u201d Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website.\nWe may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services.</p>\n<p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Services.\nand (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Services, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies we use</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our Services use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>\n<strong>Type of cookie</strong>\n<strong>Purpose</strong>\n<i>Essential Cookies</i>\n<p>These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Services and to enable you to use some of its features.</p>\n<p>Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.</p>\n<i>Functionality Cookies</i>\n<p>These cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make when you use our Services.\nThe purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Services.</p>\n<i>Analytics and Performance Cookies</i>\n<p>These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Services and how users use our Services.\nThe information gathered does not identify any individual visitor.\nIt includes the number of visitors to our Services, the websites that referred them to our Services, the pages they visited on our Services, the features they used on our Services, what time of day they visited our Services, whether they have visited our Services before, and other similar information.\nWe use this information to help operate our Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Services.</p>\n<p>We use for example Google Analytics, Mixpanel or Hotjar for this purpose.\nThose providers use their own cookies.\nIt is only used to improve how our Services works.\nYou can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies</p>\n<p>You can find out more about how Google protects your data here:

browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests.\nBased on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show adverts which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites.</p>\n<p>You can disable cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting

remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.</p>\n<i>Social Media Cookies</i>\n<p>These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \u201clike\u201d button on our Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Twitter or Google+.\nThe social network will record that you have done
