applied only to the browser from which you make the choice.</p>\n<p>Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications, or your mobile web browser may provide a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser setting which will notify those ad servers and networks who recognize the signals to refrain from sending you interest based ads to your mobile device.\nYou can check the settings on your device for such options in your device\u2019s operating system.\nAlternatively, you may wish to download the TrustE mobile application and/or the Digital Alliance \u201cApp Choices\u201d mobile application and follow the instructions provided.</p>\n<p>If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads on our Services, you may
