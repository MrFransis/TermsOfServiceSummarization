advance notice, unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Online Advertising</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use industry standard website tracking and delivery technology to serve you relevant advertising on and off the Services.\nOur services display advertisements to you via targeted advertising methods.\nThis permits us to show you certain advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests based on information we receive from visitors of the Services and by third-parties.\nYou may also see certain ads through your use of the Services because we participate in advertising networks.\nAd networks allow us to target our advertising to users through the use of click-stream, demographic, behavioral and contextual information.\nThe use of third-party tracking technologies to collect this information is often subject to their own privacy policies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Ad Serving</b> \u2013 The ads

or third party cookies.\nFirst party cookies like the ones used when you log in to your account, are set by G/O and share the same domain.\nThird party cookies, on the other hand, are stored by third party providers and organizations with different domains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use cookies that expire once you close your browser (called session cookies) and cookies that stay on your device until you delete them or they expire (called persistent cookies).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Opt-out </b>\u2013 As part of our commitment to transparency and your privacy, we provide the following links

responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites.\nFor questions about these sites, please consult their individual privacy policies.\nThis Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by G/O through our Sites.\nIf you choose to purchase a product or service via our site, some special terms apply.\nPayments are handled by a third party payment processor, whose own terms and privacy policy will govern your transaction.\nWe do not process, record or maintain your credit card, bank account or payment information, though the third party payment processor and/or the merchant may provide us with some data relating to your order, such as what you purchased and how much you spent.\nWe expressly disclaim any and all liability related to your use of any third party payment processor\u2019s system, including its privacy practices.\nWhen we link to an e-commerce site and you make a purchase on that site, we sometimes receive a small cut of the revenue.\nThe commercial relationships with e-commerce sites are handled by a third-party company.\nWe use the third party to help us automate the process of linking to products, especially as it distances our editorial staff from creating affiliate links themselves.\nOur journalists are not involved \u2013 our reviews are driven entirely by our editorial staff based on what we think.\nWe don\u2019t let any monetary incentives influence our editorial choices, and the journalists who select the links in their articles aren\u2019t aware of which sites might generate incremental revenue for G/O.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Merger, Sale or Other Asset Transfers</b> -In the event G/O goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of

contract.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Children\u2019s Privacy</b>\n</p>\n<p>We care about the privacy of children.\nAccordingly, we do not direct our Sites to children under the age of 16 or knowingly collect Personal Data from them.\nIf we learn that a user is under 16, we will promptly delete any Personal Data that the individual has provided to us.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>How We Protect Personal Data</b>\n</p>\n<p>G/O has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of Personal Data we maintain.\nUnder our security practices, access to personally identifiable information is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access, and sensitive records are to be retained only as long as necessary for business or legal needs and destroyed before disposal.\nAlthough we work hard to protect personal information that we collect and store, no program is one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information.</p>\n<p>If you become aware of a security issue, please email us at privacy@g-omedia.com.\nWe will work with you to address any problems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>How Long We Keep Personal Data</b>\n</p>\n<p>We retain the information we collect about you for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose we collected it for and for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.\nTo determine the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>\n<p>For information about deleting your Personal Data, including, your account, see
