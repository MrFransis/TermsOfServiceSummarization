Policy\n<p>Download a copy here<br>\nThis Services Privacy Policy (\u201cServices Policy\u201d) is provided by Lead Intelligence, Inc.\nd/b/a Jornaya (\u201cJornaya,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) to inform interested parties about how information is collected through our Platform, how we use such information, and how we share it as applicable.\nUnless otherwise defined in this Services Policy, terms used in this Services Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>This Services Policy applies only to our Platform.\nWe do not control the privacy policies of other websites or companies.\nIt is strictly up to you to learn more about the online privacy and data security policies of other third party websites you may come in contact with (whether or not through our Platform) directly from such third parties, as their policies may differ from ours.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>WHAT WE DO</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Jornaya provides a proprietary technology Platform, including any scripts or code provided by Jornaya (\u201cScripts\u201d), and any products/services provided by Jornaya (\u201cServices\u201d) (collectively the \u201cPlatform\u201d), which allows our Clients (as further defined below) who are sharing their data with one another to (i) verify the data\u2019s origin and history, (ii) help advertisers, vendors and marketers analyze first, second and third-party consumer (\u201cConsumer(s)\u201d) interactions to, for example, focus their attention and efforts on consumers who may be interested in certain products and/or services, and (iii) supplement our Services with related services provided by our strategic partners.&nbsp.\nIf the Consumer\u2019s browser allows it, a persistent cookie is dropped so that the same browser can be identified in future events and tied to a LeadiD or other identifiers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>OUR CLIENTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We have three types of Clients who access, use and interact with our Platform in different ways, as follows:</p>\n<p>\u201cPublishers\u201d are companies who are accessing and using the Services to create Universal LeadiDs (as further defined below) on their own web site(s) or platform(s) (\u201cPublisher Platforms\u201d).</p>\n<p>\u201cQueriers\u201d are companies who generate data on their own or receive data from another party with a Universal LeadiD or other identifiers (\u201cIdentifiers\u201d) and desire to verify and/or append certain attributes to the Identifiers by querying our network.\nA Querier can also be a Publisher.</p>\n<p>\u201cPartners\u201d are companies who work with Jornaya to provide supplemental services to Publishers or Queriers through our Services, either by incorporating certain aspects of our Services, or by integrating with our Services.\nPartners may contribute their own data or access data via APIs, SDKs, web related services.\nIn some cases, we may use Partner pixels, cookies, scripts or tags alongside our Script.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>USING OUR SERVICES ON PUBLISHER PLATFORMS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Many Publisher Platforms utilize our Services.\nWhen a Consumer visits, enters information into, browses or otherwise interacts with a Publisher Platform, the technology associated with our Services, including applicable Scripts (previously installed at a Publisher Platform with that Publisher\u2019s approval), captures certain information and automatically creates and returns to the Publisher a unique lead identifier associated with each unique online or application event known as a \u201cUniversal LeadiD\u201d.\nThe Services may use various technologies to do this, including JavaScript\u00ae, website scripts, pixel tags, cookies, local storage, and device identification.</p>\n<p>If a Consumer enters information into open text fields within a form on a Publisher Platform, our Services consider this information as potential personal information (\u201cPI\u201d) and is designed to automatically encrypt that information using a cryptographic hash function.\nThe Consumer PI that an applicable Client may obtain from our Platform includes this hashed information, other information captured through the Publisher Platform at the time a Consumer visits a Publisher Platform, including the Consumer\u2019s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language and the date and time that web page was visited, as well as other information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>INFORMATION SHARING</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We share Consumer PI only as necessary to enable us to provide our Services to Queriers who wish to verify that a certain event(s) took place at the Publisher Platform in which a Consumer participated.\nAt times, Consumer PI is shared with Partners to enable us to provide certain Services to Publishers and/or Queriers.\nWhen we act as a \u201cservice provider\u201d under the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) to our Clients, we do not retain, use, or share any personal information shared with us for any purpose other than to provide our services as specified by our contract with our Clients.</p>\n<p>A Client may provide certain additional information in its possession, such as conversion data, Identifiers, and/or other Consumer PI (\u201cContributed Data\u201d), when querying the Jornaya API, or by batch processing.\nIf any Contributed Data is provided by the Querier as part of a query or batch data, this information is utilized solely to generate applicable Jornaya Derived Data associated with that query.\nWe rely solely on our Clients to have secured the proper permissions from Consumers or other sources where they have been provided with the Contributed Data.</p>\n<p>If a Consumer does not want us to store his or her information, the Consumer can accomplish this by not visiting or not engaging with Publisher Platforms that utilize our Scripts or Services, or by requesting at the Publisher Platforms the Consumer visits not to capture or use certain information captured during an event on the Publisher Platforms pursuant to the terms contained on such Publisher Platforms.\nA Consumer may also have options to prevent cookie storage through their browser settings.</p>\n<p>We offer California residents the ability to access, delete, and opt out of the sales of their personal information consistent with the CCPA only for personal information we hold in the capacity of a \u201cbusiness\u201d under the CCPA.\nWhere we act as a service provider under the CCPA to our Clients, we will comply with applicable requests to the extent that our Clients pass them along to us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>OUR RELATIONSHIP TO CONSUMERS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>JORNAYA PROVIDES ITS PLATFORM TO OUR

mechanisms.\nWhether any Publisher Platform accepts or processes any Do Not Track signals or similar mechanisms is determined by the Publisher that owns or operates the Publisher Platform and should be addressed by the Publisher on the Publisher Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>INFORMATION SECURITY AND RETENTION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use security measures designed to protect against unauthorized

from our databases.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDER</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are an independent service provider to our Clients.\nThe fact that we provide our Platform and related services to our Clients is not meant to be an implied endorsement of, authorization of, or representation about any particular Client, nor is it an endorsement of, or representation about any Client\u2019s

through an order or a statement of work that provides additional details about your usage rights, including pricing.\n&nbsp;Additionally, as a Querier, you may choose (at your sole discretion) to enable services offered by certain Partners which are made available to you through the Client Portal or otherwise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, along with separate terms and conditions directly between you and the Partner.\n&nbsp;We do not control the terms and conditions, or the fees, applicable to services provided by our Partners.\n&nbsp;If you do not agree to such terms and conditions or fees, you should not enable or subscribe to such services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nJORNAYA\u2019S SERVICES&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) &nbsp;The two main elements of our Services are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u201cCreate\u201d is the process by which a Publisher implementing the Script on its Publisher Platform facilitates the capture of certain information through each unique consumer event (\u201cEvent\u201d) on a Publisher Platform.\n&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as a Publisher, you may utilize Create on your Publisher Platform(s).\n&nbsp;Your Create Script is unique to you and you agree that you will not share it with, or transfer it &nbsp;to, any other party.\nFor added clarity, your partners, providers or affiliates must each maintain their own account(s) with Jornaya.</li>\n<li>\u201cQuery\u201d is the process by which an Identifier(s) (which you have acquired on your own or through other sources, and subject to proper usage rights for which you are solely responsible) is queried in real-time or in batch to provide certain information about the Event (as defined above).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(b) For our Services, the main data sets are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Event Data&nbsp;</strong>.\n&nbsp;EVENT DATA IS NOT MADE PUBLIC AND IS SUBJECT TO PROTECTION AT ALL TIMES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICIES.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Platform facilitates the capture of data from Events (as defined above) which include, but are not limited to, lead history information, the URL where a consumer event occurred, Publisher\u2019s account number, Publisher name, referrer URL, and information that is entered by website visitors/end users of Publisher Platforms (\u201cConsumer\u201d) (\u201cEvent Data\u201d).\n&nbsp;Event Data is not exposed, except back to the original creator of the Event (\u201cCreator\u201d) or with the permission of the Creator.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Contributed Data&nbsp;</strong>.\n&nbsp;You may provide to Jornaya additional information in your possession, such as conversion data, or Consumer information and/or Identifiers, through a Query or batch file (\u201cContributed Data\u201d).\n&nbsp;You are solely responsible for securing and maintaining proper usage rights of any Contributed Data provided to Jornaya.\nContributed Data is not exposed without the permission of the party &nbsp;who contributed it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Derived Data&nbsp;</strong>.\n&nbsp;For any Querier utilizing the Services to perform a Query, certain \u201cDerived Data\u201d may be returned as requested by a Querier.\n&nbsp;Derived Data are derived from, but do NOT include or expose, Event Data or Contributed Data.\n&nbsp;Derived Data may be (i) related to an Event associated with a Universal LeadiD (for example, Lead Age, Data Integrity, TCPA Disclosure Match Status, Lead Origin, and Lead Velocity).\n(ii) related to a Consumer associated with a Universal LeadiD.\nor (iii) associated with any aspects of Contributed Data (as defined above).\n&nbsp;Full descriptions of available Derived Data are listed within the secure area of our Site (\u201cClient Portal\u201d).\n&nbsp;If you are the Creator of a Universal LeadiD that is part of a Query, you may block certain Derived Data elements from being shared with that Querier within your settings in the Client Portal.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Predictive Insights&nbsp;</strong>.\nA Querier utilizing the Services to perform a Query may request certain \u201cPredictive Insights\u201d.\n&nbsp;These Predictive Insights utilize Jornaya\u2019s proprietary technology for analyzing, transforming and/or aggregating the above mentioned data sets in anonymized form to provide certain scores, indicators and/or reports based on a Client\u2019s criteria to help better predict and identify consumer intent or other trends.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nPROTECTIONS AND ASSURANCES&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) &nbsp;Control Over Access to Data.\n&nbsp;As part of the Services, you have certain control over access to data as applicable.\n&nbsp;You may:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>decide whether or not, and where to place the Jornaya Script on your platform(s) to facilitate or limit the capture of Event Data;</li>\n<li>decide not to implement specific HTML tags within your implementation (for example, TCPA disclosure tags);</li>\n<li>share or not share Contributed Data.\nand</li>\n<li>decide with whom to share a Universal LeadiD.\n&nbsp;For the purpose of clarity, if you do not wish for a party to perform a Query on Universal LeadiDs that you have created, in order to limit that party\u2019s access to associated Derived Data, you can choose to not share Universal LeadiDs with that (or any) party.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(b) Aggregate Reporting.\n&nbsp;Jornaya may provide insights from the data sets referenced above in anonymous, aggregated formats, provided that the data shall not disclose or expose Event Data, including but not limited to, a Client\u2019s name, referral URLs, or other information which may help to identify a Client or otherwise allow a third party to reasonably determine that any information or data came from a specific Client as part of the aggregation.</p>\n<p>(c) &nbsp;No Ranking or Scoring of Publishers.\n&nbsp;Jornaya will not provide services or reports that rank or score a Publisher(s) or Publisher Platform(s).</p>\n<p>(d) Non-Compete.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Jornaya is not in the business of (nor do we intend to enter into) (i) buying, selling or aggregating leads, or (ii) retargeting consumers.\nboth in a manner that directly competes with our Clients during the term of this Agreement.\n&nbsp;In the event of any change in this respect, we will notify you in writing via email, and you may terminate the Agreement upon written notice to us, subject to Section 13 (Termination).\n&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, Jornaya will not use any data resulting from this Agreement to directly compete with a Client.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nPRIVACY POLICIES&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) &nbsp;The privacy and security of data and Consumer information witnessed and
