pursuant to such Requests subject to the condition that the advance will be refunded if the Request Agreements have not been formed, and the Company will confirm that such Fans have capacity to make payments equivalent to the Sale Proceeds by collecting a credit using a prescribed payment settlement method.\nWhen a Creator has Accepted a Request from a Fan by Company-prescribed method as specified in the preceding paragraph, a Request Agreement shall be formed as a two-party agreement between the Creator and the Fan stipulating that the Creator will provide the relevant Request Reward within the extent of the Plan set by such Creator, and that the Fan will pay the Sale Proceeds as consideration for such provision.\nThe Company shall, on behalf of the Creator, receive the Sale

vis a vis Fans or Creators in relation to Request Agreements, within the extent explicitly specified herein.</li>\n</ol>Article 6: Performance of Request Agreements, Permissibility of Cooling Off, etc.<ol>\n<li>If a Request Agreement has been formed, the relevant Fan will not be entitled to demand refunds of any Sale Proceeds already paid, except where explicitly specified otherwise.\nSale Proceeds are not eligible for cooling off and cannot be refunded pursuant thereto.<ul>\n<li>*Cooling off is a system enabling unconditional withdrawal of agreement applications or termination of agreements, for a certain period after application for or execution of an agreement.\nHowever, online sales are outside the scope of such systems, and cooling off systems thus cannot be used for Request Agreements as in Paragraph 1 of this article.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A Fan will not be entitled to Cancel or refund any already-paid Sale Proceeds for reason of the particulars of the Request Reward provided by a Creator.\nprovided, however, that if the Creator has not provided the Request Reward in accordance with the relevant Plan, or if there is noncompliance with the agreement in

the \u201cInquiry Form\u201d on the Site.\nIf the Company has considered such communication from the Fan and determined that the Fan\u2019s claims are reasonable, the Company will be entitled, but not obligated, to instruct the Creator to make corrections, refund the Sale Proceeds, or take other such action.\nIn such case, the Fan and the Creator shall act in accordance with the Company\u2019s

under the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions, subject Creators shall make appropriate notations on the Site as required under the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions.<ul>\n<li>To determine whether a notation under the Act on Specified Commercial Transactions is required, please refer to the \u201cGuidelines related to \u2018Sellers\u2019 in Internet Auctions\u201d on the website of the Consumer Affairs Agency, and other such resources.https://www.no-trouble.caa.go.jp/what/mailorder/</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Creators shall have fully performed their obligations to provide Request Rewards when they provide such Request Rewards to Fans in accordance with Request Agreements.\nThe acceptance of new Co-requesting shall also terminate at such time.\nPayment to Creators of Sale Proceeds that the Company has received from Fans on behalf of Creators shall be as specified in Article 8.</li>\n</ol>Article 7: Deletion or Termination of Requests<ol>\n<li>A Fan will be entitled to rescind the transmission of Requests by Company-prescribed procedures if the relevant Creator has not yet Accepted such Request.</li>\n<li>A Request will be retracted automatically if seven days have passed from the date of transmission of such Request without the relevant Creator Accepting such Request.\nAll Sale Proceeds advances received by the Company will be refunded to the relevant Fan.</li>\n<li>If, after the formation of a Request Agreement, 60 days have passed from the date of transmission of a Request without the relevant Creator providing the Request Reward to the Fan, such Request Agreement will be deemed terminated, and all Sale Proceeds received by the Company will be refunded to such Fan.</li>\n<li>The following items shall apply in the case where a Creator account has been deleted.<ol>\n<li>If account deletion occurred before the formation of a Request Agreement (before Request Acceptance), the Plan set by the relevant Creator will be deemed to have been retracted, and will be deleted.</li>\n<li>If account deletion occurred after the formation of a Request Agreement (after Request Acceptance) but before full provision of the Request Reward, all Sale Proceeds paid shall be refunded to the relevant Fan.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The following items shall apply in the case where a Fan account has been deleted.<ol>\n<li>If account deletion occurred before the formation of a Request Agreement (before Request Acceptance), the Fan will be deemed to have retracted the relevant Request.</li>\n<li>If account deletion occurred after the formation of a Request Agreement (after Request Acceptance) but before full provision of the Request Reward, the Fan is deemed to have waived the right to receive the Request Reward under such Request Agreement.\nNo Sale Proceeds will be refunded to the Fan in such case.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The Company will be entitled to terminate Request Agreements before full provision of the relevant Request Rewards if it determines that a prohibited act as set forth in Article 13 has been committed.\nAll Sale Proceeds received by the Company in connection with such Request Agreements will be refunded to the Fans of
