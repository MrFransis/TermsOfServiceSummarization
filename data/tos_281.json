"text": "User Agreement\n<p>\n<strong>Summary</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Zooniverse is a suite of citizen science projects operated by research groups in several institutions which support scientific research by involving members of the public - you - in the processes of analyzing and discussing data.\nData from these projects is used to study online community design and theory, interface design, and other topics.\nThis document describes what will happen to your contributions if you choose to contribute and what data we collect, how we use it and how we protect it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What you agree to if you contribute to the Zooniverse</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Projects involving the public are needed to enable researchers to cope with the otherwise unmanageable flood of data.\nThe web provides a means of reaching a large audience willing to devote their free time to projects that can add to our knowledge of the world and the Universe.</p>\n<p>The major goal for this project is for the analyzed data to be available to the researchers for use, modification and redistribution in order to further scientific research.\nTherefore, if you contribute to the Zooniverse, you grant us and our collaborators permission to use your contributions however we like to further this goal, trusting us to do the right thing with your data.\nHowever, you give us this permission non-exclusively, meaning that you yourself still own your contribution.</p>\n<p>We ask you to grant us these broad permissions, because they allow us to change the legal details by which we keep the data available.\nthis is important because the legal environment can change and we need to be able to respond without obtaining permission from every single contributor.</p>\n<p>Finally, you must not contribute data to the Zooniverse that you do not own.\nFor example, do not copy information from published journal articles.\nIf people do this, it can cause major legal headaches for us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What you may do with Zooniverse data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You retain ownership of any contribution you make to the Zooniverse, and any recorded interaction with the dataset associated with the Zooniverse.\nYou may use, distribute or modify your individual contribution in any way you like.\nHowever, you do not possess ownership of the dataset itself.\nThis license does not apply to data about you, covered in the Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal details</strong>\n</p>\n<p>By submitting your contribution to the Zooniverse, you agree to grant us a perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sub-licensable license to: use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and exercise all copyright and publicity rights with respect to your contribution worldwide and/or to incorporate your contribution in other works in any media now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in your contribution.</p>\n<p>If you do not want to grant to us the rights set out above, you cannot interact with the Zooniverse.</p>\n<p>By interacting with the Zooniverse, you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Warrant that your contribution contains only data that you have the right to make available to us for all the purposes specified above, is not defamatory, and does not infringe any law.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Indemnify us against all legal fees, damages and other expenses that may be incurred by us as a result of your breach of the above warranty.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Waive any moral rights in your contribution for the purposes specified above.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This license does not apply to data about you, covered in the Privacy Policy.</p>\nPrivacy Policy\n<p>In addition to the contributions you make towards the scientific goals of the Zooniverse, we collect additional data about you to support and improve the operation of the project.\nWe also conduct experiments on the design of the website that we evaluate based on your reactions and behavior.\nThis Privacy Policy describes what data we collect, how we use it and how we protect it.</p>\n<p>We respect the privacy of every individual who participates in the Zooniverse.\nWe operate in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, as well as with United Kingdom and United States regulations regarding protection of human subjects in research.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data we collect</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Identifying information</em>: If you register with the Zooniverse, we ask you to create a username and supply your e-mail address.\nYour e-mail address is not visible to other users, but others will see your username in various contexts.\nNotably, your username is associated with any classifications or other contributions you make, including on comments submitted to Talk, the discussion forums hosted by the Zooniverse.\nYou may optionally provide your real name to be included when we publically thank participants, e.g., in presentations, publications or discoveries.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Usage information</em>: We also monitor how people use our website, and aggregate general statistics about users and traffic patterns as well as data about how users respond to various site features.\nThis includes, among other things, recording:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When you log in.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pages you request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Classifications you make.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other contributions, such as posts on Talk pages.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you register and log in, the logs associate these activities with your username.\nOtherwise, they are solely associated with your IP address.\nIn order to collect this data, we may use software such as Google Analytics that collects statistics from IP data.\nThis software can determine what times of day people access our site, which country they access the websites from, how long they visit for, along with technical details of their computer (browser, screen type, processor).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What we do with the information we gather</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Usage information is collected to help us improve our website, and for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Internal record keeping.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you agree, we will periodically send email promoting new research-related projects or other information relating to our research.\nInformation about these contacts is given below.\nWe will not use your contact information for commercial purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will use the information to customize the website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To conduct experiments regarding the use of site features.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>What is shared with third parties</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will never release e-mail addresses to third parties without your express permission.\nWe will also never share data we collect about your use of the site unless (a) it cannot be associated with you or your username, and (b) it is necessary to accomplish our research goals.\nSpecifically, we can share your anonymized data with research study participants, other researchers, or in scholarly work describing our research.\nFor example, we might use one of your classifications as an illustration in a paper, show some of your classifications to another user to see if they agree or disagree, or publish statistics about user interaction.</p>\n<p>If you choose to give us a `Publishable Name' on registration, this is available to research teams in projects you have participated in for purposes of giving credit for your work in published papers and elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Contributions you make to the Talk pages are widely available to others.\nAside from the above, information is held within our secured database.\nPasswords are hashed rather than being stored in plain text.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we use cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In some areas of our site, a cookie might be placed on your computer.\nA cookie is a small file that resides on your computer's hard drive that allows us to improve the quality of your visit to our websites by responding to you as an individual.</p>\n<p>We use cookies to identify which pages are being used and improve our website.\nWe only use this information for statistical analysis purposes, they are not shared with other sites and are not used for advertisements.</p>\n<p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies.\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.\nHowever, if you choose to decline cookies from the Zooniverse then functionality, including your ability to log-in and participate, will be impaired.</p>\n<p>Acceptance of cookies is implied if you continue to access our website without adjusting your browser settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Where we store your data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use Amazon Web Services so we can quickly and reliably serve our website to an unpredictable number of people.\nThis means that your data will be stored in multiple locations, including the United States of America (USA).\nAmazon is a participant in the Privacy Shield program developed by the USA Department of Commerce and the European Union (EU).</p>\n<p>Our mailing list server, which contains a copy of subscribed email addresses and no other personal data, is hosted on a virtual private server with Linode in the UK.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Security measures</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Members of the research teams are made aware of our privacy policy and practices by reviewing this statement upon joining the team.\nWe follow industry best practices to secure user data, and access to the database and logs are limited to members of the research group and system administrative staff.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Removing your data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Due to the way in which we archive data, it is generally not possible to completely remove your personal data from our systems.\nHowever, if you have specific concerns, please contact us and we will see what we can do.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When we will contact you</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you do not register, we will never contact you.\nIf you do register, we will contact you by e-mail in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Occasionally, we will send e-mail messages to you highlighting a
