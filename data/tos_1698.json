etc.).\n</p>\n<p>\nc.\nluckycloud regularly carries out maintenance work on its systems for the security of network operation, maintenance of network integrity, interoperability of services and data

terminate the usage relationship in compliance with the contractually agreed notice period before the new prices come into effect.\nIf you do not terminate after notification of the new prices and

liable for damage in the event of intent and gross negligence.\nIf luckycloud breaches an essential contractual obligation (cardinal obligation) in a way that endangers the purpose of the contract, liability is limited to the typical damage that luckycloud could reasonably foresee at the time of conclusion of the contract, unless the breach of obligation is caused intentionally or by gross negligence.\nThis limitation shall not apply in the event of injury to life, body and/or health and in the event of liability under the Product Liability Act.\n</p>\n<p>\nb.\nIf the Customer is an entrepreneur, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law, liability shall be limited to the contractual fees paid by the Customer in relation to the Services, except in cases

extent necessary for the contractual provision of services and permitted by law.\nWe will process personal data confidentially and in accordance with the provisions of the EU Data Protection Basic Regulation, the Federal Data Protection Act (new) and will not pass them on to third parties.\n</p>\n<p>\nb.\nBeyond this, your personal data will only be used if you have expressly consented to this.\nYou can revoke your consent at any time.\n</p>\n<p>\nc.\nAs part of the basic data protection regulation, the customer must conclude an agreement with luckycloud for order processing in accordance with Art.\n28 DSGVO.\nFor this purpose luckycloud provides a contract for downloading in the personal customer dashboard under \"Download Manager\", which the customer can upload after signing at the relevant place in the Download Manager.\n</p>\n<p>\nd.\nFurther detailed information can be found in our privacy policy.\n</p> &nbsp;18&nbsp;Amendment of the AGB <p>\nluckycloud reserves the right to amend these GTC at any time, insofar as this is necessary for good reasons, in particular due to a change in the legal situation, technical changes or further developments, regulatory gaps in the GTC, changes in the market situation or other comparable reasons and does not unreasonably disadvantage the customer.\nThe customer will be notified of changes to the GTC in writing or by e-mail at least four weeks before they take effect.\nThe amendments shall become effective if the customer does not object in writing or by e-mail within this period of four weeks and luckycloud has informed the customer of this legal consequence in the notification of amendment.\nIn the event of an objection we reserve the right to terminate the user relationship.\nIn each notification of change you will be informed separately of the consequences of the change and your right of objection and/or termination.\n</p> &nbsp;19&nbsp;Final provisions <p>\na.\nAll changes,

text form.\n</p>\n<p>\nb.\nOffsetting or a right of retention may only be declared against claims of luckycloud with undisputed or legally established counterclaims.\n</p>\n<p>\nc.\nGerman law applies to disputes arising from these terms and conditions.\nThe exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising out of or in connection with these terms and conditions is Berlin.\n</p>\n<p>\nd.\nShould individual provisions of these terms and conditions be or become invalid in whole or in part, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected.\nIn this case, the contractual partners undertake to replace the invalid provision with a valid provision that comes as close as possible to the economic purpose of the invalid provision.\nThe same applies to any gaps in the agreements.\n</p>\n<p>\ne.\nThe law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply.\nThe application of the UN Sales Convention is excluded.\n</p> Status of the AGB - August 2020
