below).\nGamezop does not support, endorse or offer to Contestants \u2018games of chance\u2019 for money.Participating in Games of Skill competitions for cash prizes is legal in all states of India except Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Odisha, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana.</li>\n<li>SEVERABILITYIf, for any reason, a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms, or

of the Terms shall continue in full force and effect.</li>\n<li>WAIVERNo provision of the Agreement shall be deemed to be waived and no breach excused, unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by Gamezop.\nAny consent by Gamezop to, or a waiver by Gamezop of any breach by the User, whether expressed or implied, shall not constitute consent to, waiver of, or excuse for any other different or subsequent breach.</li>\n<li>GAMES OF SKILLA Game of Skill is a game where the outcome is determined mainly by mental or physical skill rather than by chance.\nGamezop does not support, endorse or offer to Contestants \u2018games of chance\u2019 for money.It is the dominant element of skill or chance which determines the character of the game.\nThe outcome or success in the Contests hosted on Gamezop platform is directly dependent on the Contestant\u2019s effort, performance and skill.\nContestant\u2019s skill and knowledge of the Contest may be enhanced with practice.\nAdditionally, Contests on the Platform have Rules and Contestants are encouraged to read, understand, and follow them.Different Contests will reward different skills, but each Contest will reward one or more skills, viz., knowledge of the game, familiarity with Rules, practice, hand-eye coordination, etc.The two main enactments dealing with gaming in India, are the pre-Independence Public Gambling Act, 1867 (<b>\u201cPGA\u201d</b>) and the Prize Competitions Act, 1955 (<b>\u201cPCA\u201d</b>) and both create a specific exception for Games of Skill.With respect to the PCA\u2019s regulatory ambit, in the case of R.\nM.\nD.\nChamarbaugwalla v.\nUnion of India, the Supreme Court held that the only competitions that are sought to be controlled and regulated by the PCA are those in which success does not depend to any substantial degree of skill.\nTherefore, it ruled that games that are predominantly based on skill are excluded from the regulatory purview and penalising terms of the PCA.\nThis position was reiterated in the case of News Television India Ltd.\nv.\nAshok D.\nWaghmare where the Bombay High Court found the programme \u2018Kaun Banega Crorepati\u2019 to be based around a game of skill and not in violation of the PCA as it essentially required a participant to utilise his / her general knowledge and memory to provide answers to questions on various topics such as history, geography, sport, music, politics, cinema, science and technology, etc.</li>\n</ol>", "created_at": "2021-10-28 22:01:31.480685", "updated_at": "2021-10-28 22:01:39.268534"},
