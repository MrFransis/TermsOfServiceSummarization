store on the device (e.g., computer, mobile phone, tablet, or any other mobile device) that you use to access any of the Bodybuilding.com Platforms (as defined in our Terms of Use).\nWe collect these cookies for a number of purposes, including: (i) to recognize repeat users.\n(ii) enable you to use and access Bodybuilding.com\u2019s Platforms.\n(iii) to help facilitate your navigation through and interaction with the Bodybuilding.com Platforms.\n(iv) to provide personalized content.\nand (v) for fraud detection and prevention.\nSpecific types of cookies we collect are described below.\nMost cookies expire after a certain period of time depending on what we use it for.\nWe use cookies for several reasons, which we describe below.</p>\n<p>By using Bodybuilding.com\u2019s Platforms, you expressly consent to the use of cookies as described on this page as well as in our Privacy Policy.\nYou may adjust your cookie settings at any time as described in section 7 below.</p>2.\nWHAT COOKIES DO WE USE?<p>Bodybuilding.com\u2019s Platforms use both first-party cookies (which are set by the websites and/or mobile apps being visited) and third-party cookies (which are set by a server located outside the domain of our websites and/or mobile apps).</p>3.\nFUNCTIONAL OR ESSENTIAL COOKIES<p>(Example: login session cookies)</p>\n<p>Certain cookies are necessary in order for Bodybuilding.com\u2019s Platforms to operate correctly.\nFor example, we use cookies to authenticate you.\nWhen you log on to our websites, authentication cookies are set which let us know who you are during a browsing session.\nAdditionally, if you have created an account with Bodybuilding.com through a social media login, such as Facebook, these cookies allow us to facilitate such login on our website or mobile apps.\nFunctional cookies do not include social media or advertising cookies, which are discussed below.</p>4.\nEXPERIENCE OR PREFERENCE COOKIES<p>(Example: language setting cookies.\nRTP Cookies \u2013 customizing content)</p>\n<p>These cookies collect information about your choices and preferences (e.g.\nusername and language selection) and are used to enable certain additional functionality on our websites, such as storing your preferences.\nThis functionality improves user experience and allows us to customize your site experience accordingly.</p>5.\nSOCIAL MEDIA AND ADVERTISING COOKIES<p>(Examples: Facebook/Google Plus using social media for behavioral advertising, analytics, advertising and market research.\nAdRoll)</p>\n<p>Social media cookies collect information about social media usage and allow you to connect to your social networks to share content from our website or mobile apps.</p>\n<p>We may also use advertising cookies to market Bodybuilding.com products or services to you on third party websites.\nFor example, if you visit our website, you may then see an advertisement for Bodybuilding.com products or services on certain third-party websites you visit in the future.\nInformation about this is described under the paragraphs in our Privacy Policy entitled \u201cService Providers\u201d and \u201cThird Party Partners And Integrations.\u201d</p>\n<p>We sometimes use cookies delivered by third parties to track the performance of our advertisements.\nFor example, these cookies remember which browsers have visited our websites.\nThe information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after we receive it.\nThis process helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.</p>\n<p>We also contract with third-party advertising networks that may collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, emails, and on third-party websites.\nAd networks follow your online activities over time by collecting website navigational information through automated means, including through the use of cookies.\nThey use this information to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you.\nYou may see these advertisements on other websites.\nThis process also

Analytics)</p>\n<p>Analytics cookies collect information about your use of the Bodybuilding.com Platforms, and enable us to improve the way it works.\nFor example, analytics cookies show us which are the most frequently visited pages on our website or mobile apps, help us record any difficulties you have (e.g., mobile app crashes), and show us whether our advertising is effective or not.\nThis allows us to see the overall patterns of usage on the Platforms, rather than the usage of a single person.\nWe use the information to analyze Bodybuilding.com Platforms\u2019 traffic to help create a better user experience.\nAnalytics cookies may be classified as either functional, experience/preference, or social media/advertising cookies.</p>7.\nHOW DO I MANAGE COOKIES?<p>If you'd like to remove or disable cookies via your browser, you certainly can.\nYou'll want to refer to your browser's configuration documentation (usually the Help portion of your browser\u2019s toolbar) to do this since the steps for doing so are usually browser-specific.</p>\n<p>Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies.\nTo learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.</p>\n<p>Your mobile device may allow you to control cookies through its settings function.\nRefer to your device manufacturer\u2019s instructions/settings panel for more information.</p>\n<p>For customers located in the EEA, you may adjust your Cookie

order at any time prior to dispatch.</p>G.\nApplicable Law<p>These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the UK, and the application of the United Nations Convention
