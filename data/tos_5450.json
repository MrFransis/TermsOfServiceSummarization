\u201c<strong>Subscription</strong>\u201d), you expressly authorize us or our third-party payment processor to charge you for such Services.\nYou represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment methods that you provide to us.</p>\n<p>5.2.2.\nAll fees are stated and solely payable in U.S.\nDollars, non-refundable, and not subject to setoff.\nYou are solely responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, and any other fees you incur as a result of the charges billed by us.</p>\n<p>5.2.3.\nIn the event that you fail to pay the full amount owed to us, we may limit your access to the Services, in addition to any other rights or remedies we may have.</p>\n<p>5.3.\n<strong>Authorization for Recurring Payments.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.3.1.\nAll pricing plans involve recurring fees (each, along with any applicable taxes and other charges are a \u201c<strong>Subscription Fee</strong>\u201d).\nDepending on which options you choose, those fees may recur each month, quarter or year thereafter, at the then-current rate.\nPlease note that our fees are subject to change, although we will notify you before we effect any change.</p>\n<p>5.3.2.\nBy agreeing to these Terms and purchasing a Subscription, you acknowledge that your Subscription has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your Subscription by you or Figma.\nWe (or our third party payment processor) will automatically charge you in accordance with the term of your Subscription (e.g., each month, quarter, or year), on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription using the payment information you have provided.</p>\n<p>5.3.3.\nIn the event your Subscription begins on a day not contained in a later month, your payment method will be charged on such other day as we deem appropriate.\nFor example, if you started a monthly Subscription on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your payment method would be billed on that date.\nWe may also periodically authorize your payment method in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges.</p>\n<p>5.3.4.\nYour Subscription continues until cancelled by you or we terminate your access to or use of the Services or the Subscription in

period.\nCancelling your Subscription will not terminate your Account.\nSee Section 10 (Termination) below for information on terminating your Account.</p>\n<p>5.5.<strong> Taxes.\n</strong>Subscription<strong>\n</strong>Fees do not include taxes, and you agree to: (a) pay all sales/use, gross receipts, value-added, GST, personal property, or other tax (including any

any information or tax returns with respect thereto.</p>\n<p>5.6.\n<strong>Withholding.\n</strong>Further, all payments made by you to us under these Terms will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding.\nIf any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required by law, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us after such deduction or withholding will be equal to the full amount that we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required.\nEach party will use commercially reasonable efforts to work with the other party to help obtain, reduce, or eliminate any necessary withholding, deduction, or royalty tax exemptions where applicable.</p>6.\nConfidentiality.<p>6.1<strong> Confidential Information.</strong> We (the \u201c<strong>Discloser</strong>\u201d) have disclosed or may disclose proprietary or non-public business,

of the Services or these Terms (each, a \u201c<strong>Claim</strong>\u201d) in binding arbitration instead of court, except that either party may bring suit in court to enjoin the infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What is arbitration?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury.\nInstead, a neutral person (the \u201carbitrator\u201d) hears each party\u2019s side of the dispute and makes a decision that is finally binding on both parties.\nThe arbitrator can award the same relief as a court could, including monetary damages.\nWhile court review of an arbitration award is limited, if a party fails to comply with the arbitrator\u2019s decision, then the other party can have the arbitration decision enforced by a court.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Can a Claim be part of a class action or similar proceeding?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>NO.\nYOU AGREE TO RESOLVE YOUR CLAIMS WITH US SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.\nWE AGREE TO DO THE SAME, WHETHER OR NOT YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION.\nACCORDINGLY, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE BOTH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR MEMBER IN ANY CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What rules apply in the arbitration?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted under the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d) Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201d).\nThe AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How will the arbitration be conducted? How much does it cost?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA or a comparable arbitration body in the event the AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>Unless the arbitrator finds your Claim frivolous, we\u2019ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees if your Claim is for less than $10,000, and we won\u2019t seek our attorneys\u2019 fees and costs if we prevail in the arbitration.\nThe arbitration may be conducted in writing, remotely (e.g., by videoconference), in San Francisco, California, United States or at some other location that we both agree to.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How do I start an arbitration proceeding?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding against us, send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claim to legal@figma.com, 760 Market St, Floor 10, San Francisco, CA 94102.\nIf we request arbitration against you we will give you notice at the email address or street address you provided.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPTING-OUT OF ARBITRATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to agree to arbitrate your Claims as explained above, then you can opt-out of this arbitration agreement by notifying us of your decision in writing at legal@figma.com, 760 Market St, Floor 10, San Francisco, CA 94102.\nYou must opt-out within 30 days of the date you first agree to these Terms or any updated Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN THE ABSENCE OF ARBITRATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The sole jurisdiction and venue for any Claims that are not handled by arbitration will be the state and U.S.\nfederal courts located in San Francisco, California, and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.\nBY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FIGMA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.</p>\n<p>This Section 11.17 only applies to Claims between us and individuals, and is governed by The Federal Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p>11.18.<strong> Dispute Resolution for Entities.\n</strong>If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, any claim, cause of action, or dispute between the company or other legal entity and Figma arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved exclusively accordingly to the process set forth in Section 11.17, except that, to the extent legally permitted, (1) each party will be responsible for their own filing, administrative, arbitrative and similar fees, (2) the losing party will pay the prevailing party for all costs and attorney\u2019s fees and (3) the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply to any arbitration between us.</p>\n<p>11.19.<strong> Interpretation.</strong> Whenever the words \u201cincluding,\u201d \u201cinclude,\u201d or \u201cincludes\u201d are used herein, they will be deemed to be followed by the phrase \u201cwithout limitation.\u201d</p>\n<p>11.20.<strong> Beta Features.</strong> Product features clearly identified as Alpha or Beta features (collectively \u201c<strong>Early Access

to the contrary in the Terms, all Early Access Features are provided \"AS IS\" without warranty of any kind and without any performance obligations.</p>\n<p>11.21.<strong> Entire Terms</strong>.\nThese Terms supersedes all other agreements between the parties relating to its subject matter.\nThe parties expressly agree that any different or additional terms set forth in any purchase order, vendor portal, code of conduct, or other similar documentation provided by you will not apply between the parties even if signed, acknowledged or accepted by Figma, unless Figma specifically references this clause and waives its rights.</p>Exhibit A \u2013 Service Terms<p>\n<strong>1.\nWho may use the Services.\n</strong>You may only use the Services if you are old enough to
