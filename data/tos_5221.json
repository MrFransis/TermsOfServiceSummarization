conditions.\nThese terms and conditions apply to all offers and agreements in connection with the online sale and delivery of Under Armour apparel, shoes and accessories (\u201c<b>UA Apparel</b>\u201d), but excluding digital products and services (e.g., Premium Memberships), which are expressly addressed in Section 8 of the Terms above.\nAccordingly, the specific terms and conditions set forth below apply when you order any UA Apparel (i) from underarmour.com, or UA.com, of any of its country extensions.\n(ii) from any site that is directly connected to UA.com.\nor (iii) any Under Armour e-commerce or shopping application (collectively, \u201cUnder Armour Shopping\u201d).</p>\n(a)\tAccount Registration\n<p>An account is not required to shop via Under Armour Shopping.\nTo make online shopping faster and easier, however, you may register for an account with us on one of our websites or applications.\nPlease confirm your email address when creating your account as we will use the email address on file to contact you.\nIf you have an account, you will have the ability to track shipments, view past orders, and quickly access your shipping and billing information with a username and password.\nIf you do not want to set up an account, you can still purchase from Under Armour Shopping as a \u201cGuest.\u201d</p>\n(b)\tOnline Availability\n<p>When shopping, once you\u2019ve selected the item you wish to purchase you can determine what color/size is in stock by first selecting the color (1.Select Color), and then the size (2.Select Size).\nIf the size you want is not listed for the selected color, it is not available.\nAlthough Under Armour Shopping is designed to feature \u201creal-time\u201d inventory levels so that only in-stock items are visible and available for purchase, we may experience shortages of stock due to overwhelming popularity of a particular style, color or size, and cannot guarantee that items which appear to be in stock are actually available.\nIf the item you would like to purchase is currently out of stock, we apologize for the inconvenience and encourage you to call our customer service line so that we may help you find a similar product.</p>\n\u00a9\tLocating the Style Number\n<p>If you are looking for a product\u2019s style number, it is located inside your garment on a small white tag.\nIt will read, for example, FW081100200 or on older styles FW060375.\nThe first four characters reference the season of the style (ex.\nFW06=Fall/Winter 2006) (although, depending on region, the style number for some products may not include the first four characters) and the last seven (on new styles) or four (on older styles) characters reference the style number.\nYou can search this style number on our Services to find exactly what you are looking for.\nIf no results are found, the style may no longer be manufactured by Under Armour.\nPlease contact our customer service team for assistance in finding a replacement product.</p>\n(d)\tOrdering and Changes to Orders\n<p>When you place an order we will send a confirmation email to the address you have provided.\nIf you are using your workplace email address, be aware that many corporations use spam filters to disqualify incoming automated emails, which could hamper delivery of our confirmation email to you or send it to junk mail.</p>\n<p>The \u201cconfirmation\u201d stage sets out the final details of your order.\nFollowing this, we will send you an order acknowledgement email detailing the products you have ordered.\nPlease note that this email is not an order confirmation or order acceptance from Under Armour.\nAcceptance of your order and the completion of the contract between us will occur upon our dispatch to you of the products ordered, unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled it.</p>\n<p>Due to the close time frame between order and shipment, it is difficult to make changes once your order has been placed.\nHowever, if you contact us within an hour of placing your order and we will attempt to facilitate a change.</p>\n(e)\tTax\n<p>Sales Tax and similar taxes, such as value added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d), are calculated using local and national rates depending on where you are located.\nWhere VAT is applicable, you will be charged at the local rate and it will be included in the product price.</p>\n(f)\tPayment\n<p>Under Armour reserves the right to supplement the list of acceptable forms of payment for Under Armour Shopping.\nWe may require credit cards and debit cards to be issued by an institution in the jurisdiction in which you are located, and those forms of payment must be linked to a billing address in the same jurisdiction.\nFor most jurisdictions, you must ensure that the billing address on file with the credit or debit card-issuing bank is the same billing address you enter when ordering.\nWe do not accept personal checks, money orders or cash payments online.</p>\n<p>Because Under Armour does not charge for items until they ship, we may use a pre-authorization process to reserve your products for shipment.\nIn order to avoid unnecessary overdraft charges, a method called a \u201cpre-authorization\u201d is often used by banks to verify that the credit/debit card in use is valid and has sufficient funds.\nPlease note that the transaction description will show up on your statement as \u201cUNDER ARMOUR.\u201d Most authorizations expire within five to seven days.\nhowever, the issuing bank ultimately determines the length of the authorization.\nThe final credit or debit card charge will only reflect the value of your shipped merchandise plus applicable shipping and taxes.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to call our customer service team.</p>\n<p>If you are experiencing problems with payment, please contact our customer service team-a member of our team will be happy to assist you.</p>\n(g)\tDelivery and Shipping\n<p>There are some locations that we cannot ship to, and we do not ship to post office boxes, so please confirm that we can deliver to you before placing your order.</p>\n<p>The estimated delivery time and shipping costs for each order will be presented at checkout.\nWhile we make every effort to deliver goods within the estimated timelines, delays occasionally occur.\nUnder Armour shall not be liable for any delay or failure to deliver goods within estimated timelines.</p>\n<p>Under Armour reserves the right to require goods to be signed for by an adult aged 18 years or over upon delivery.\nIt is not always possible for customers in one jurisdiction to purchase from Under Armour Shopping in another jurisdiction.\nPlease visit our local website to see what stock is currently available to you.</p>\n<p>You will generally receive a tracking number via email once your package has been shipped.\nYou can also find your tracking number(s) by logging into your account and entering the Order Number from your order confirmation email to track your package.\nPlease allow two to four business days between placing your order and using the tracking tool.</p>\n<p>If you tracked your order on our website and received the message that your order is \u201cin transit\u201d, this simply means that your order is being processed for shipment, or that the tracking information has not yet been updated with the shipping carrier.\nIt typically takes two to four business days for the carrier to receive our tracking information.</p>\n<p>We strive to ship all items in an order together, but we reserve the right to deliver your products in separate shipments if one or more items are unavailable at the time of initial shipment.\nIn the event that we split your order into more than one shipment, you will not be charged separate shipping costs for each shipment.\nFurther, each shipment will have a confirmation/tracking email.\nIf we experience an issue fulfilling one part of your order, that will not serve as a basis for canceling any of the other items included in that order.</p>\n<p>Any orders that are delivered to you will become your property at the time that you receive them, provided that Under Armour has received full payment for the order.</p>\n(h)\tCancellations, Exchanges and Refunds\n<p>The cancellation, exchange and refund policies and procedures that apply to your order may vary depending on where you are accessing Under Armour Shopping.\nFor additional information about the policies that apply to a particular order, please review the policies listed in the Customer Service and Additional E-Commerce Terms section of the local website that you used to place the order.</p>\n(i)\tConflicts of Terms.\nGoverning Law\n<p>To the extent these Under Armour Shopping terms are inconsistent with the Terms, these Under Armour Shopping terms will supersede and prevail

\u201c<em>Buyer</em>\u201d, respectively.\nSeller and Buyer may also be referred to as \u201c<em>Party</em>\u201d and together as \u201c<em>Parties</em>\u201d.\n\u201c<em>Agreement</em>\u201d means the relevant Confirmation and these Conditions.\n\u201c<em>Confirmation</em>\u201d means the confirmation in writing (including confirmation by email, per Seller\u2019s EDI system, Seller\u2019s web shop or through any other digital (communication or order) system of Seller) by Seller to Buyer unambiguously expressing Seller\u2019s acceptance of Buyer\u2019s order.\nAny order requires the issue of a Confirmation by Seller to Buyer to constitute an Agreement binding upon Seller.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.2</strong> No other general terms and conditions shall be applicable or supplement or set aside (any part of) these Conditions unless expressly agreed to by Seller in writing.\nReference by Buyer to any other general terms and conditions is hereby explicitly rejected.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.3</strong> In case of any inconsistency between the English version of these Conditions and a version in any other language, the English version shall prevail.</p>\nArticle 2\tOffers, Confirmation and Agreement\n<p>\n<strong>2.1</strong> Any offer of Seller shall not be an offer but merely an invitation to enter into negotiations with respect to the sale of Goods.\nFor completeness\u2019 sake, all Seller\u2019s offers (including actual offers as well as invitations to enter into negotiations), also including verbal offers or other declarations by Seller\u2019s (sales) representatives and/ or employees, either as price lists or otherwise (\u201cOffers\u201d) are completely free of obligation and do not oblige Seller in any way to conclude a contract with Buyer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2</strong> No Agreement will be constituted but after Confirmation by Seller after receipt of the order or after Seller has commenced to carry out the

Buyer shall pay to Seller all costs related to such taking back of the Goods.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.8</strong> All Agreements are entered into on the assumption that Buyer is sufficiently creditworthy and if Seller has any reason to doubt such, Seller may require full or partial payment in advance or set other payment conditions for delivery and suspend, delay or cancel any credit delivery or any other performance of its obligations.</p>\nArticle 3 - Delivery\n<p>\n<strong>3.1</strong> Delivery terms shall be set out in the Confirmation and be interpreted in accordance with the Incoterms

of failure to deliver\u201d and a reasonable time, which will be no less than 30 days, in within which to cure.\nBuyer\u2019s sole remedy for Selling failing to cure such breach within such reasonable time will be specific performance.</p>\n<p>Where the parties will have expressly agreed that time is of the essence, Seller must be declared to be in default in writing in the event of late delivery, and be granted a reasonable term of at least 30 days as of the date of the receipt of notification to fulfill its obligations.\nIn the event that such extended term is exceeded, Buyer will be entitled to dissolve the Agreement or part of the Agreement only with respect to the Goods not delivered within such reasonable time.\nIn such an event, Seller will not be liable to pay damages, unless such damages are the consequence of gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller\u2019s executive management.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.3</strong> Seller is entitled to deliver the Goods sold

recognizable as the property of Seller.\nIn addition, it will be obliged to insure such Goods against, inter alia, fire and water damage and theft.\nBuyer will pledge to Seller any claims it has

the cost price resulting from any government measures, an increase in the prices of energy, raw materials or other materials necessary for the manufacture of the Goods ordered by Buyer and/or an increase in freight, storage, insurance charges, wages and exchange rates occurring prior to the agreed date of delivery, Seller shall have the right to increase the price of the Goods ordered accordingly, even if such an increase was foreseeable at the time of concluding the Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.3</strong> In the event the increase of the cost price for the Goods exceeds 15%, Buyer shall have the right to cancel the Agreement within 3 days after Buyer has received the prior written notice of each such an increase.</p>\nArticle 6 - Payment terms\n<p>\n<strong>6.1</strong>

paid by Buyer shall be credited by Seller against the debts receivable by Seller from Buyer, including those pursuant to the previous paragraphs, in the chronological order of the due dates of the

delivery.\nBuyer must report defects not visible upon delivery within 48 hours of their discovery, though in any event within 48 hours after the time that Buyer should reasonably have discovered them.\nBuyer will not be entitled to any claim if the defect results from any normal wear and tear, incorrect operation, installation, storage, maintenance or from transport, misuse or improper handling by Buyer (i.e.\nall use that is deemed as such according to industry\u2019s best practices), or any other event that must be attributed to the Buyer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.3</strong> Buyer will be obliged to perform the inspection or to have the inspection performed with due care, upon receipt of the Goods.\nBuyer will bear the risk for inspecting the Goods by means of random checks and may not rely on the fact that it did not observe a defect that was visible and could have been discovered upon delivery because it\u2014or a third party engaged by it\u2014did not inspect the entire shipment.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.4</strong> Any such claims of Buyer need to be supported by evidence from an independent expert or surveyor.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.5</strong> Buyer may ship Goods returned

reasonable judgment and to the exclusion of any other rights of Buyer by law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.7</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have no obligations for breach of warranty in

reporting pursuant to Article 7.2 or b) 12 months after the delivery date.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.9</strong> For completeness\u2019 sake, this warranty and the warranty obligations set forth therein

7.2 and Article 8.1 of these Conditions.</p>\nArticle 8 - Liability\n<p>\n<strong>8.1</strong> Seller\u2019s total aggregate liability, on any basis whatsoever, with respect to any offer, order,

misconduct of Seller\u2019s executive management.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.5</strong> The Buyer will compensate and indemnify Seller against any claims by third parties and all resulting costs in connection with any Goods or other products supplied by Seller.</p>\nArticle 9 - Breach and Termination\n<p>\n<strong>9.1</strong> Without prejudice to any rights or remedies Seller may have under

to the sales price.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2</strong> Where possible and on request of Buyer, Seller will apply an exemption or a low or zero percent Tax rate or a suspension scheme as provided for under the applicable legislation.\nBuyer will in such case provide Seller with all documents (including an annotated copy of the administrative accompanying document) and information reasonably requested by Seller in accordance with the applicable legislation.\nIf any (additional) tax becomes due because Buyer has not timely provided Seller with such documents or information, or because of any fraud, loss or misappropriation in relation to the Goods, documents or information, Buyer shall indemnify Seller against all liabilities for such Tax which Seller reasonably needs to pay to a third party, including any interest, penalties and costs.\nIf Seller is subsequently able to obtain a credit or repayment of such Tax from a third party, Seller shall reimburse Buyer the amount so credited or repaid less all reasonable costs, penalties and interest incurred by Seller.\nParties undertake to inform each other of any relevant facts so that remedial action can be taken, and to take into account the interest of the other in any dealings with national fiscal/customs authorities to resolve disputes.</p>\nArticle 12 - Force Majeure\n<p>\n<strong>12.1</strong> Seller shall not be in breach if any obligation suffers from Force Majeure.\nForce Majeure includes, without limitation, strikes, lockouts and industrial actions, breakdowns of machines or tools or other breakdowns within

or riots, in- or export impediment and any other governmental measure or regulation as well as any other circumstance that is beyond Sellers control and which would result in Seller\u2019s inability to perform in accordance with the Agreement.\nForce Majeure must also be deemed to apply in the event that one or more of the above-mentioned circumstances occur within the companies of Seller\u2019s suppliers and Seller cannot or could not perform its obligations, or cannot or could not perform such in good time, as a consequence.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.2</strong> In case of such a non-attributable failure, Seller is entitled to either (i) suspend the performance of the relevant part(s) of the Agreement for the period such a non-attributable failure continues or (ii) terminate the Agreement without any liability whatsoever.</p>\nArticle 13 - Hardship\n<p>If, prior to the date of delivery of the Goods, the circumstances that existed at the date of conclusion of the Agreement should change to such an extent as to make it impossible for either party to be reasonably required to fulfill one or more of its obligations under the Agreement, and if such change could not have been reasonably foreseen by such Party, then Seller and Buyer shall jointly investigate, at the request of the injured Party, whether such hardship can be removed in a manner acceptable to the non-injured party.\nIf no agreement is reached within a reasonable time, the injured Party shall be entitled to terminate the Agreement.</p>\nArticle 14 - Compliance with laws\n<p>\n<strong>14.1</strong>\tEach Party represents that it is duly authorized to enter into an Agreement with the other Party and represents that with respect to its performance there under, it will comply with all applicable laws.\nBy

neutral arbitrator.\nThe place of arbitration shall be Amsterdam.\nThe language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English, and the arbitrator(s) shall apply Dutch law.\nWithout prejudice to any other rights or remedies that Seller may have, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach by Buyer and that accordingly Seller shall be entitled, without proof of special damages, to the remedies of injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach and Seller will be entitled to apply for injunctive relief and other provisional measures either to the court competent to grant such injunction or order, or under the Rules for expedited arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.4</strong> Any business information submitted in the arbitration shall be kept secret at all times at the Arbitration Institute may adopt such measures as it deems appropriate to secure the confidentiality of such

the court that would have had jurisdiction in the absence of the provisions or Article 15.3 and Article 15.5.</p>\nAnnex I\nInternet Sales Policy for E.U.\nDealers\n<p>\n<strong>UNDER ARMOUR EUROPE

extends to Internet Dealer\u2019s website, advertisement, sponsored link, and any on-line marketing.</p>\n<p>a.\nInternet Dealer\u2019s domain(s) and URL(s) must not contain any Under Armour trademark, including \u201cUnder Armour,\u201d \u201cUA,\u201d or any other trademark used or owned by Under Armour (e.g.\n\u201cColdGear,\u201d \u201cHeatGear,\u201d \u201cAllSeasonGear\u201d), including any variation or combination of these words or trademarks with each other or with other words.\nunless that trademark appears to the right of the country code domain name suffix i.e., co.eu.</p>\n<p>b.\nInternet Dealer may use terms such as \u201cUnder Armour Headquarters,\u201d \u201cUnder Armour Outlet,\u201d \u201cUnder Armour Depot\u201d or \u201cUnder Armour Store\u201d only

accordance with official Under Armour policy, Internet Dealer must not associate Under Armour products with any qualification that may suggest that Under Armour is not a premium brand, or that the specific products offered for sale have less value than the typical Under Armour product.\nTherefore, without prejudice to the right to establish its resale prices, Internet Dealer must not use terms such as \u201ccheap,\u201d \u201cexcess,\u201d or \u201cliquidation\u201d in connection with the Under Armour\u00ae products on any website, in any advertisement, sponsored link, or any other on-line

third-party website on which Internet Dealer advertises or markets Under Armour\u00ae products.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Internet Dealer must advertise its Under Armour products consistent with Under Armour\u2019s high quality brand image.</p>\n<p>a.\nInternet Dealer must submit any proposed \u201cpaid for\u201d search terms for pre-approval to Under Armour to ensure use of such terms are consistent with Under Armour\u2019s brand image.</p>\n<p>b.\nInternet Dealer must accurately describe Under Armour\u00ae products using the Authorized Marks.\nThe Authorized Marks must always be followed by the generic word for the product, such as \u201cUnder Armour\u00ae products\u201d or \u201cColdGear mock.\u201d They must never be used in the possessive or in the plural.\nThe Authorized

advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and app usage over time and across websites or apps.\nOur advertising practices also include the creation and use of \"audience segments.\" You have the option to restrict the use of information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads.\nDepending on where you access our website from, you may also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including advertising cookies.\nAdditional information on Audience Segments and our choices for interest- based advertising is found below.\n<ul>\n<li> Audience Segments Read More <p> We disclose various types of information for purposes of interest-based advertising, including for third party, interest-based advertising.\nThis processing includes the use of Personal Data to create de-identified audience segments.\nThese audience segments are then made available for interest-based advertising, including for third party advertising, on Under Armour online properties.\nThe audience segments are based on website visits, app usage data, Fitness and Wellness Data, online and offline purchasing behaviours, interaction with our ads or marketing emails, similar types of information, and in some cases, data from third parties.\nThe segments, prior to being used, are de-identified so that they will not identify you personally.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>United States Note</b>: The audience segments are made available for interest-based advertising for third party advertising on Under Armour online properties and on and within third party websites and apps.\nWe use one or more safe haven entities and partners to de-identify segments before sharing these segments for third party advertising displayed on online properties operated by entities other than Under Armour.\nWe use a third party to match de-identified segments to targeting IDs that are then used on third party sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Interest-Based Advertising Opt Outs, Choices, and Control Read More <p>For all of the interest-based advertising described above, including segments, you have the choice to not have your data used to target and serve you interest-based advertising-including third party advertising-regardless of where such ads might be served.\nThese opt-outs require that strictly necessary cookies are not blocked by the settings in your web browser.\nWe support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance in the US, the Canadian Digital Advertising Alliance in Canada, and the European Digital Advertising Alliance in the EU.\nIf you live in the United States, Canada, or the European Union, you can visit Ad Choices (US), Your Ad Choices (Canada), or Your Online Choices (EU) to find a convenient place to opt-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities for each region.\nThese websites also provide detailed information about how interest-based advertising works.\nOpting out does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising from us, or when you use the Internet.\nIt just means that the data collected from our website will not be used for interest-based advertising and that the advertising you see displayed on websites will not be customized to your interests.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em> Mobile Apps.</em> You may opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile devices by activating the \"Limit Ad Tracking\" or equivalent feature offered by your mobile platform.\nIt will transmit a signal to us and to third-parties that

the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, and exercise other controls regarding website and online data collection, interest-based advertising, your communication settings, and app preferences.\nDepending on the Service, collection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to work.\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We provide you several ways to manage your preferences: <br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Cookie Use and Controls Read More <p> Cookies serve a wide variety of purposes.\nCookies are pieces of data stored in your web browser that are transmitted to websites to remember your browser over time and distinguish it from other users.\nCookies are used to remember your shopping cart and personalize your web experience and for security, analytics, marketing, and interest-based advertising.\nOur cookies are placed and read by our web servers, while other cookies are placed and read by other companies' web servers.\nInformation on specific cookies is found on our website via the AdChoices link.\nYou can block and control cookies using the information noted in this section.\nIf you block all cookies, certain functionality on our website will not work.\n</p>\n<p> One way to think about cookies is based on their function.\nThe following settings will control our use of browser cookies, the use of IP address for tracking, and the collection and use of data for cookie-based, interest-based advertising.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>[ IN ] Required Cookies</b>.\nThese strictly necessary cookies are used for core functionality, and recognize when you are signed in, remember things such as shopping carts and text entered, are necessary for security, and enforce your privacy preferences.\nWithout these cookies, some functionality on our websites will fail.\nYou can block these cookies in your browser preferences.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>[ IN / OUT ] Functional Cookies</b>.\nThese cookies help to improve the sites by allowing us to understand how the site is used and how the site performs.\nThese cookies include analytics and measurement.</li>\n<li>\n<b>[ IN / OUT ] Advertising Cookies</b>.\nThese cookies help us and other parties personalize ads that are shown to you on our sites and Services, as well as on other sites.\nIf enabled, these cookies will allow third parties engaged in

network to a computer, mobile device, Internet of Things (IoT) device, or routing device.\nIP addresses, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, include \"public\" IP addresses, such as the IP address for a home router that is visible to the Internet, as well as \"local\" IP addresses, which are IP addresses assigned to computers and mobile devices \"behind\" a router (such as a home router).\nOur advertising and analytics partners may use IP addresses to group or correlate devices for purposes of analytics, security and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad targeting, ad attribution, and limiting ad frequency.</p>\n<p>You can choose not to have IP address used for purposes of advertising or analytics by using the cookie controls for \"Advertising Cookies,\" and \"Performance/Analytics,\" above.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> Web Pixels or Beacons Use Read More Pixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web browser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party corresponding to the pixel.\nIf that party's cookies are currently stored in your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request.\nBeacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the opening of a marketing email.\nWhen used in conjunction with cookies for interest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to control the purpose for which they are used.\n</li>\n<li> HTML5 Local Storage Read More HTML5 Local Storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be used for the same purpose (to pair a tracking ID to a particular web server with your web browser so that the web server can identify your web browser over time).\nYou can control the purpose for which HTML5 Local Storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above.\n</li>\n<li> Flash Cookie Use Read More Flash cookies are \"local shared objects\" used by Flash player to store data, similar to cookies.\nAlthough Flash content is declining in use, we may still use Flash on our sites.\nIf you have Flash installed, and wish to delete, block, or manage Flash cookies, please use the Flash settings panel made available by Adobe.\n</li>\n<li> Social Network Interaction and Widgets Read More Social network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our websites passively transmit data regarding a social network's members to that social network, even when a button is not clicked.\nThese technologies may allow a social network (such as Facebook, Twitter or YouTube) to personally identify its members and to know the web pages its members have visited.\nThis is true wherever social network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is \"clicked\" or \"pressed.\" If you belong to a social network or use these categories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of those services to understand the nature of the data that they collect and what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is collected and used.\nIf you disable advertising cookies, the passive tracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.\n</li>\n<li> Mobile Device Advertising IDs, Location, Sensor Data, and

running on that device).\nWhen that signal is received by Under Armour or third parties, it communicates your choice to not have device IDs or Location Data used for purposes of advertising or analytics.\nWe honor the signal and require that our third party advertising and analytics partners do the same.\n<br> To the extent our mobile apps personalize functionality for you, you can change these settings within the app, or reset to defaults by deleting and reinstalling the app.\n</li>\n<li> Other Ways to Manage Your Location Services Read More You can also turn off the transmission of
