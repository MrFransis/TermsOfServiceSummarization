should still stay on track with their given topic.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Do not insult other users.\nIf it isn't nice, just don't say it.\nEven if another user is insulting you, it is best to just report their content and move on.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Do not abuse any feature of the forums or your privileges may be revoked.</b>\n<ol>\n<li>Do not abuse the resources system.<ol>\n<li>Posting malicious resources is strictly not allowed.\nThis includes plugins which are malicious towards players (e.g.\ncrashing their client).</li>\n<li>Posting someone else's plugin or resource is not allowed.\nThis includes minor edits such as configuration changes and code taken directly from tutorials or other resources.<ol>\n<li>\"Premium Resources\" are held to a higher

especially if you are criticising its price or worth.</li>\n<li>Do not distribute \"Premium Resources\" to those who have not purchased them.</li>\n<li>Using pay-per-click sites such as adf.ly or similar services to distribute resources is forbidden.</li>\n<li>You are allowed to obfuscate your resources, however the decompiled code must be somewhat legible by staff and is subject to the following limitations:<ol>\n<li>Free resources may only use basic name obfuscation (ie what Mojang does with Minecraft).<ol>\n<li>This limits you to certain free publicly available obfuscators (eg Proguard, yGuard).<ol>\n<li>See https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/420746/ for a complete list of approved obfuscators and settings.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Do not use string obfuscation or anything that hides code flow.</li>\n<li>In exceptional circumstances exceptions to this rule may be granted.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>All resources must retain an unobfuscated package root and main class name.<ol>\n<li>com.example.myplugin.MyPlugin is an acceptable main class name, com.example.myplugin.a, a.a.a.MyPlugin or a.a.a.a.\nare not.</li>\n<li>com.example.myplugin.a.a is an acceptable secondary class name, a.a.a.SecondaryClass or a.a.a.a are not.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Obfuscation designed to crash inspection tools is not allowed.<br>\n</li>\n<li>All parts of a class must be visible when decompiled and it must be clear what all parts of the code is supposed to do.<ol>\n<li>Class encryption is not allowed.\nIt does not add meaningful security anyway.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Obfuscated class or member names should not be unnecessarily long or difficult to inspect.<ol>\n<li>Long (eg llililililillllllliiiillliiiiillii) or illegal (eg CON1)

allowed.</li>\n<li>We may request you use a different obfuscator or none at all.</li>\n<li>We reserve the right to remove obfuscated resources without consultation, especially if we believe obfuscation is being used to hide rule-breaking code.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>You may not use the name of other servers or brands to advertise your resource unless consent has been given.\nThis means that resources such as \"XXXX inspired by YYYY.net\" / \"AAAA like BBBB\" are not allowed unless YYYY.net has given permission for their brand to be used in this way.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>This includes the \"post ratings\" feature which is designed to be used appropriately and in moderation.</li>\n<li>Do not attempt to bypass restrictions such as minimum character or word count.</li>\n<li>Do not access the forums via automated mechanisms.</li>\n<li>Do not blank out question threads after you have received an answer.\nDoing so will lead to a 1 week

contravene other rules.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Do not post content in the wrong category.</b>\n<ol>\n<li>Spigot has several categories available to allow us to keep content organized.\nPlease post in the correct category, and if you are unsure, post it in what you think is the closest match.</li>\n<li>Where applicable, please follow the category specific sticky threads which outline what content is and isn't acceptable, as well as what format to post it in.</li>\n<li>Where SpigotMC software is concerned, discussion, support and distribution should be limited to official versions and sources.</li>\n<li>Resources that require third party software to load (e.g.\nSkript) should clearly state so in the description.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>No advertising servers, products, or services outside of the \"Services &amp.\nRecruitment\" section.</b>\n<ol>\n<li>Many of our users are already very busy with their own servers, so advertising your own is not generally productive.\nInstead consider using the \"Rate My Server!\" section for suggestions on improvement.<ol>\n<li>Only post an IP or server address if it is necessary for the purpose of the thread.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Do not post threads asking for the community to \"Name your X\", including, but not limited to usernames, servers, services, products, etc.<ol>\n<li>This includes

removed.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Advertisements that are more than a line or two must be kept out of the first half of the description.\nPlease put banners and large bodies of text towards the end of the description (ie below the fold).<br>\n</li>\n<li>Please keep advertisements limited to what is reasonably necessary.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Advertising must be limited to the resource page itself.\nYou may not use resource updates, the resource itself (eg console or in-game messages), or any other location for any advertisement whatsoever.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Advertisements must be directly related to running or developing a Spigot based Minecraft server or network.<ol>\n<li>SpigotMC reserves the right to determine what constitutes an advertisement and to disallow specific advertisements at any time for any reason.</li>\n<li>Advertisements may not include products or services in competition with SpigotMC or its affiliates.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>You must have an actual business arrangement with the advertisement target or sponsor.<ol>\n<li>This means that you cannot promote your resource by feigning endorsement or sponsorship.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The advertisement must not contravene other forum rules.</li>\n<li>Authors that are found to be abusing the use of advertisements may lose the option to do so.</li>\n<li>This rule is not subject to 'grandfathering' as prior

jurisdiction.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Creation of multiple accounts is not permitted.</b>\n<ol>\n<li>If you have a legitimate need for a second account, please email tmp-support@spigotmc.org to

access remain in good standing.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>You are responsible for all actions performed by your account.<ol>\n<li>Keeping your account secure is your responsibility.\n\"I was hacked\" and \"It was my friend/brother\" are not excuses.<ol>\n<li>We provide additional mechanisms such as \"two factor authentication\" to help you with this.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Usage of a public proxy or VPN is at your own risk.\nIf the IP address you use is shared with banned users, you too may be banned.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Name changes are generally available only to donors and only at our

tmp-support@spigotmc.org.</li>\n<li>Discussion of your ban, or other user's bans is strictly prohibited.</li>\n<li>Accounts may not be sold without specific permission from SpigotMC.\nIf there is any indication you are attempting to, or have sold your account it will be permanently banned.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Be sure to follow any and all section specific rules, and their implications across the forums as a whole.</b>\n<ol>\n<li>Services and Recruitment</li>\n<li>Resources<ol>\n<li>Resource reviews will not be moderated or removed by staff unless they violate a general forum rule.<ol>\n<li>This means that \"false\" reviews will not be removed unless there is evidence of targeted harassment.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If users are found to be abusing the review system, specific punishments may be enacted.</li>\n<li>Resources may only be transferred to another user if the current author requests so via the report feature.\nResource transfers are final and cannot be

admin@spigotmc.org.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<b>Punishment System</b>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Punishments for violations of these rules are issued by moderators and highly dependent on context.\nThe following is provided as a guideline only and extreme variations may be encountered:<ul>\n<li>The more specific the rule is, the harsher the punishment will be.\nThis means for example that if you make a slightly rude post, it may just be deleted with a warning, whereas if you post a malicious resource then the punishment may be an instant ban.</li>\n<li>Moderators will always consider previous behaviour before issuing a punishment.\nThis means that persistent rule breakers will be subject to progressively harsher punishments and may ultimately be permanently excluded from our services.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nThanks,<br>\n~ Spigot Team ", "created_at": "2018-08-22 11:00:13.882899", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 15:50:41.561831"}, {"id": 412, "name": "Cookie Usage",
