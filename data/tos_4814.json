a nutshell:</em> as far as it\u2019s under our control, we will never use your information, or willingly let it be used, for anything other than CraftBru.com related stuff that you give us permission for.</p> Cookies <p>At the time of the last update of this policy (5 July 2021), CraftBru.com, the website, generates a few <em>cookies.\n</em>Essentially a cookie is a bit of information stored in your browser that most sites, this one and virtually every other, uses to do things.\nWordPress (our site\u2019s content management system) creates 3 (named <em>tk_*</em>), and if you manage to find one or more WooCommerce store pages, you\u2019ll see 2 more.\nThey are all functional, do not track across the web, and contains no info that can identify you.\n</p>\n<p>On this date we have also removed Google Analytics and Google Ads, and as such you should not receive cookies from these services during a visit to this site.\n</p> Using our eCommerce System for Bookings or Purchases <p>Our WooCommerce shop is currently disabled.\nThese T&amp;Cs will be updated should it be renabled.\nIf in the past you purchased or paid for a listing on CraftBru.com, you may request a copy of your data stored with us (if any), and even request such data be deleted, provided such data is not required for compliance with local business, industry and/or tax laws.</p> Newsletter Info <p>When you sign up to the CraftBru Monthly newsletter, we need your email address and at least your first name.\nYou can also complete your newsletter profile with your surname, address and birth date.\nWe promise not to visit you at home, ever (unless you invite us for beers and a braai).\nInstead, we aggregate the towns and/or cities, which is insightful when we\u2019re planning giveaways or promotions, and your birth date (we only ask for the day and month) will enable us to help you celebrate your birthday month with tailored special offers.</p>\n<p>The newsletter\u2019s related info is also stored offsite, at the newsletter service we use.\nWe only ever use that info to send the CraftBru Monthly and, in future, perhaps a birthday greeting.\nThe system we use sends out certain additional admin confirmation emails, like when you update your info, or you unsubscribe.</p>\n<p>There is always a link in every email that allows you to unsubscribe from the email list, so, heavens forbid, if you ever get bored, you can unsubscribe and you will stop receiving them.\nYou can leave a reason if you want, that would be helpful, but it\u2019s optional.</p>\n<p>The service allows us to collect \u201crewards\u201d in the form of credits.\nAt the bottom of each email you\u2019ll see the service\u2019s logo.\nIf you click that logo, sign up and maybe one day down the line decide to pay for something they offer, we will get credits to use for advanced features, or to pay for sending out our own emails.\nThat would require some form of tracking, so be aware of that.\nThe service we use (and this link would earn us those rewards if you clicked it and signed up for a paid product) is MailChimp.</p>\n<p>Aaaand, that\u2019s all of it.\nIf you read this far you totally deserve a beer and we should meet up for one*.</p>\n<p>*you\u2019re buying</p> ", "created_at": "2021-08-11 00:30:37.158333", "updated_at": "2021-08-10 22:31:14.406568"}], "points": [{"id": 24687, "title": "You can
