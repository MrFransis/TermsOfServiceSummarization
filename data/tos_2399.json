OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nIF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICE.<br>Arbitration and Class Waiver</p>\n<p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Service, other than a court action to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, (\u201cCovered Disputes\u201d) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms as a court would.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules, including the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards.\nJAMS\u2019s rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS rules.\nWe will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.<br>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p>This arbitration and class waiver agreement not only applies to Covered Disputes between you and Fivestars, but also to Covered Disputes between you and Reward Providers, other merchants who participate in Fivestars loyalty programs, or vendors who perform services for Fivestars.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Choice of Law</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Except as provided above in the Arbitration and Class Waiver section, these Terms will be governed by the laws of California without regard to choice of law principles.\nThis choice of law provision is only intended to specify the use of California law to interpret this Agreement and does not create any other substantive right to non-Californians to assert claims under California law whether by statute, common law, or otherwise.<br>Termination</p>\n<p>You agree that Fivestars, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Fivestars believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms.\nAny suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your use of the Service and may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.\nFivestars may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice.\nYou agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of these Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Fivestars may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all of your related Rewards.\nFurther, you agree that Fivestars shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>User Disputes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user, Rewards Provider or third party in connection with the Service (or any third-party service with which the Service is integrated), and Fivestars will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.\nFivestars reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any Rewards Provider or other third party in connection with the Service (or any third-party service with which the Service is integrated).\nIn addition, without limiting the foregoing, Fivestars will have no liability or responsibility for any acts or omissions of Rewards Providers with respect to their use of any of your information or your interactions with them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and Fivestars and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Fivestars with respect to the Service.\nYou also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.\nThe failure of Fivestars to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you and Fivestars nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to Fivestars\u2019 intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.\nYou agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.\nA printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.\nThe section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nNotices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.\nThe Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p> ", "created_at": "2020-11-08 07:39:42.375806", "updated_at": "2020-11-08 07:39:46.332261"}], "points": [{"id": 12318,
