Competitions, and Goals\n<p>If you choose to upload data from your Garmin device to Garmin Connect, we collect recorded data from those activities so you can analyze it and track your progress toward your goals.\nIf you want to, you can even share your activity data with others.\nPlus, you can withdraw your consent and delete activities at any time.\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re opted-in to product
