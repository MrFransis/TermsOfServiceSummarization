DisclosureWhat You Need to Know About the California Consumer Privacy Act and Internet-Based Advertising <p>As described in our privacy notice, Square and third parties that provide advertising or other functionality on our behalf, may use cookies, pixel tags, and other technology to help us advertise our products and services to you as informed by your interests.\nThis approach is called interest-based advertising, which means we tailor our ads to you based on information that gives us a sense of what interests you, such as information collected from your activity on the web, including but not limited to, browsing or purchasing products on or through our websites or on third party websites, your activity on mobile sites and applications, or your responses to our marketing emails.</p>\n<p>Square does not sell your data, has not in the past, and is committed not to do so in the future.\nWhile the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) lacks clear guidance whether this type of interest-based advertising would be considered a \u201csale\u201d of personal information under that law, we do not believe this information constitutes a \u201csale\u201d under CCPA.</p>\n<p>However, we also want to provide you with ways for you to control the cookies and internet-based information you may share with us.\nYou can always restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or remove them from your browser by going to your browser settings.\nMore information on how to manage these settings on common browsers and devices are below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage

parties as to account ownership, we will be the sole arbiter of such dispute in our sole discretion.\nOur decision (which may include termination or suspension of any Square Account subject to

PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p> 20.\nDisputes <p>When you see the word \u201cDispute\u201d in these terms, here\u2019s what it means.</p>\n<p>\u201cDisputes\u201d are defined as any claim, controversy, or dispute between you and Square, its processors, suppliers or licensors (or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees), whether arising before or during the effective period of these Terms, and including any claim, controversy, or dispute based on any conduct of you or Square that occurred before the effective date of these Terms, including any claims relating in any way to these Terms or the Services, or any other aspect of our relationship.</p> 21.\nBinding Individual Arbitration <p>This section provides details about how we will resolve disputes through the arbitration process.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General.</strong>\nYou and Square agree that any and all Disputes, except those that are resolved informally or brought in a small claims court, will be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same individual damages and individual relief that a court can.\nANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nCLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.\nYOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST SQUARE.\nIf any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pre-Filing Requirement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes.</strong> Before an arbitration is commenced, you or Square agree to attempt to avoid the costs of formal dispute resolution by giving each other a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve a Dispute informally.\nBoth parties recognize that this is an important requirement, and that breach of this requirement would be a material breach of the Terms.\nTo provide this opportunity, before commencing any arbitration or suit, each party agrees to send to the other party a written Notice (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nAny Notice to Square should be sent by mail to Square, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142.\nAny Notice sent to you will be sent to the address on file for your account.\nThe Notice must: (i) include your name and account number.\n(ii) provide detailed information sufficient to evaluate the merits of the claiming party\u2019s individualized claim and for the other party to determine if an amicable resolution is possible.\nand (iii) set forth the specific relief sought, including whatever amount of money is demanded and the means by which the demanding party calculated the claimed damages.\nBoth parties agree that they will attempt to resolve a dispute through an informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice is sent.\nAfter that sixty (60) day period and not before, either party may commence arbitration.\nEach party agrees that state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California, referenced below, may enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been commenced in violation of this paragraph.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Scope of Arbitration.</strong> If we are not able to resolve the Dispute by informal negotiation or, as provided below, in a small claims court, all Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d) administered by the American Arbitration Association (https://www.adr.org) according to this Section and the Commercial Arbitration Rules for that forum, except you and Square will have the right to file early or summary dispositive motions and to request that the AAA\u2019s Expedited Procedures apply regardless of the claim amount.\nExcept as set forth above, the Arbitrator shall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the General Terms and/or Additional Terms (or any aspect thereof) are enforceable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Small Claims Court.</strong>\nSubject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, either party may elect to pursue a Dispute in a local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as the matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual basis.\nIf a party has already submitted an arbitration demand to the AAA, the other party may, in its sole discretion, inform the AAA that it chooses to have the Dispute heard in small claims court.\nAt that time, the AAA will close the arbitration and the Dispute will be heard in the appropriate small claims court, with no fees due from the arbitration respondent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16, including its procedural provisions, fully applies.\nAny arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco, California, at another mutually agreeable location or, if both parties agree, by telephone or videoconference.\nThe Arbitrator\u2019s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nSquare values your privacy, particularly with respect to your financial transactions and data.\nEach of the parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration and shall not (without the prior written consent of the other party) disclose to any third party the fact, existence, content, award, or other result of the arbitration, except as may be necessary to enforce, enter, or challenge such award in a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise required by applicable law.\nWhile an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief, the Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual party\u2019s claim.\nThe Arbitrator\u2019s decision and judgment thereon will not have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Fees.</strong> In accordance with the AAA Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or us) is responsible for paying the applicable filing fee.\nFor purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Square also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Opt Out.</strong> You may reject this provision, in which case only a court may be used to resolve any Dispute.\nTo reject this provision, you must send us an opt-out notice (the \u201cOpt Out\u201d) within thirty (30) days after you create a Square account or we first provide you with the right to reject this provision.</p>\n<p>The Opt Out must be mailed to Square, Inc., Attn: Arbitration Provision, PO Box 427069, San Francisco, CA 94142.\nFor your convenience, we are providing an opt out notice form you must fill in to Opt Out.\nYou must complete this form by providing your name, address, phone number and the email address(es) you used to sign up and use the Services.\nThis is the only way of opting out of this provision.\nOpting out will not affect any other aspect of the General Terms, Additional Terms, or the Services, and will have no effect on any other or future agreements you may reach to arbitrate with us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Court Proceedings.</strong>\nSubject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions as discussed above) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California.</p> 22.\nGoverning Law <p>Our relationship is governed by the laws of California, federal law, or both.</p>\n<p>These General Terms and any Dispute will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, as set forth above, and by California law and/or applicable federal law, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles.</p> 23.\nLimitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute <p>Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues.</p> 24.\nAssignment <p>You may not transfer any rights you have under our terms of service to anyone else.</p>\n<p>These General Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you and any attempted transfer or assignment will be null and void.</p>
