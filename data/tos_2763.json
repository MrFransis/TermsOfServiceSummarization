<p>We believe that what you browse online should be private.\nWhat you browse is no one\u2019s business but your own.\nIt\u2019s as simple as that.\nWe believe privacy is essential to a free internet.\nWhen you're under surveillance or being tracked, you think twice before investigating certain ideas or visiting certain websites.\nThrough internalized self-censorship, this creates a kind of prison in our minds.\nWe believe in free investigation, free minds, and a free internet.\nPrivacy is essential to all of those ends.</p> Why should I worry about my browsing not being private? <p>Your browsing history reveal a lot about who you are.\nIt's often bundled with your offline data like your purchases,location, credit history, and personal identity and this data is sold on data exchanges every single day.\nIt can and is being used to determine if you can get health or life insurance, what price to charge you at online stores, your job application status, and much more.\nImagine visiting webpages on getting out of a speeding ticket one day then seeing your car insurance rates go up a few months later.\nOr visiting a site about diabetes treatments then applying for health insurance policies only to find all of them won\u2019t cover \u201cdiabetes related illness.\u201d Beyond that, privacy is essential to freedom of thought.\nIf you know you're under surveillance, you're significantly less likely to research or express minority views.\nThe goal of a governmental surveillance system is to effectively build \"prisons in our minds.\" Writers around the world are already reporting chilling self-censorship effects from government surveillance.\nYour browsing is personal and valuable, protect it.</p> Are companies really using my browsing history to determine if I get a job or health insurance or other things? <p>Yes.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that \u201cWebsites Vary Prices based on User Information\u201d so for example Kim and Trude who live a few miles apart saw a 10% difference in the price quoted online at the same website for the same product (WSJ Article).\nOffline data is being merged with online data and sold to insurance companies and others.\nThe CEO of a data analysis firm that analyzes online data for insurance companies admits to buying junk food or hamburgers with cash to avoid being labeled as unhealthy (Economist Article).\nThose are just two examples.\nThere are many, many more reported by the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and many other publications.</p> Why should I use Epic? <p>When you use the Epic Privacy Browser, you get privacy in a fast, simple browser.\nHave a fabulous browsing experience that's private.\nProtect your browsing and searches from your ISP (in many countries they can sell your browsing history), hundreds of companies tracking you, and governments.</p> How does Epic protect my privacy? <p>Epic does several things to protect your privacy.\nEpic by default removes all Google services from Chromium so that your browsing does not go through Google\u2019s servers.\nYou can manually turn on Epic\u2019s built-in encrypted proxy (basically an in-built VPN for the browser) anytime (it\u2019s the icon at right in the address bar).\nEpic blocks thousands of trackers and widgets from tracking your browsing and searching across the internet.\nEpic has an encrypted data preference so whenever possible, Epic connects you securely.\nEpic always blocks third-party cookies and sends a do-not-track me signal.\nEpic never collects any data about your browsing or search queries beyond basic data tallies such as the bandwidth passing through our servers or the numerical count of searches performed in a day.\nEpic services such as auto-fill in the address bar are local so that what you\u2019re typing is never sent to any server with the exception of video downloading which when selected does ping a server we operate.\nEpic is always in private browsing or incognito mode so that after you close Epic, your browsing data is deleted.</p> Should I close Epic regularly? <p>Yes, please do.\nIt\u2019s helpful to close Epic regularly because this \u201ccleans\u201d Epic out.\nEpic does allow first-party cookies and HTML5 data storage and a few other things without which most websites wouldn\u2019t work, so it\u2019s important to \u201cclean\u201d your browser out of all that data regularly.\nEpic is always in private browsing mode, so when you close Epic it deletes all stored data \u2013 unlike other browsers no other effort on your part is required.</p> Should I log into Gmail when I use Epic? <p>If you\u2019re doing searches via Google in Epic, then we would strongly recommend you not log into Gmail while using Epic.\nGoogle\u2019s new privacy policy allows it to aggregate your personal data across all its services.\nSo if you\u2019re logged into Gmail, then Google can track your searches.</p> Where is Epic based? Which investors are backing Epic? <p>Our software development team operates out of Bangalore.\nGraham Holdings (formerly the Washington Post Company) and a small group of angel investors are backing us.</p> Does Epic provide total privacy? Could forensic recovery find my browsing data? <p>Unfortunately no browser and no one at this point can provide total privacy and that includes Epic.\nEpic provides as much privacy as possible while still offering a fast, normal browsing experience \u2013 excellent protection from the general surveillance that is occurring.\nEpic blocks many but not all fingerprinting techniques and scripts.\nPlugins can leak your actual IP address as well as enable others to fingerprint you -- this shouldn't be a concern for most users as no plugins are active by default in Epic.\nWhen you use Epic's encrypted proxy, all of your browsing does pass through our encrypted proxy servers which is the one aspect of Epic which is not private-by-design.\nThe single node does make Epic much faster than onion networks as well as secure.\nThe TOR browser is highly private but can not be considered secure as many exit nodes are run by malicious hosts.\nPlease note we never log any browsing history or website visits and have relayed as much to every single request by governmental agencies who've requested data from us.\nForensic software tools can recover browsing data even after Epic is closed, a problem facing all browsers including the TOR browser.\nWe haven't addressed this issue yet because it's quite difficult and would be cumbersome to do thoroughly as many OS files which are out of our control may cache some browsing data.\nIn terms of other tools which are resistant to forensic recovery and extremely private, TAILS is probably the most reputable (be warned it's not easy to set up or use).\n</p> Is Epic like my current browser (chrome, ie, firefox)? <p>Yes, but better.\nEpic is private and probably even faster.\nEpic is built on Chromium which is the same base as the Google Chrome browser.\nSince Epic blocks a lot of tracking scripts and other requests, web pages usually load up faster in Epic.\nEpic is always in a private browsing or incognito mode and has additional privacy protections to protect you from being tracked online.</p> What about just using private browsing or incognito mode? <p>Private Browsing or Incognito Mode doesn\u2019t stop anyone from tracking you.\nIt prevents someone from looking at your browser's history and knowing what you browse, but it won\u2019t protect your browsing and searches from being tracked.\nYour browsing history is still easily accessible via your dns cache even upon Incognito window close.\nWhen you search or browse in Incognito Mode, that data is generally going to Google\u2019s servers and hundreds of data collectors can continue to track you.</p> What about using privacy addons in my Chrome or Firefox? <p>Using privacy addons is not advisable because addons can access all your browsing, searches and almost everything you type in your browser.\nThat\u2019s why we block almost all addons \u2013 they represent a huge privacy risk.\nMoreover, many so-called privacy addons do in fact save and sell your browsing history (look up the popular addon \"Web of Trust\").\nWe\u2019ll also note that at present no set of privacy add-ons for any browser provides the full set of protection you get while running Epic.</p> Why does Epic block almost all Addons or Extensions? <p>Addons can access everything you type and do in the browser.\nMany have been found to save and sell your browsing history (look up the Web of Trust).\nWhile they can be very useful, they represent a very large security and privacy risk hence Epic only allows a few trusted addons.</p> How is Epic built on Chromium? Isn\u2019t Chrome also built on Chromium? <p>Chromium is an open source project led by Google and is the base of the Chrome browser.\nAll the code in Chromium is free to use by anyone.\nChromium was created by Google and also utlizes a great deal of open source code from KDE, Apple, Mozilla and others.</p> Why worry about data collectors? <p>Your browsing can be used to determine if you get health insurance, auto insurance, car insurance, a job and much more.\nImagine subscribing to Weight Watcher\u2019s magazine and being denied health insurance.\nThe much-touted \u2018Big Data\u2019 industry into which billions of dollars are being invested has designs to collect and use your personal data in such controversial ways.</p> What\u2019s the difference between Epic and Tor? <p>TOR is a network that helps provide anonymity to browse the internet.\nYou can get a TOR browser which is a version of Firefox which accesses the TOR network and has various privacy protections.\nTOR is an innovative product and effort.\nIt's particularly useful when you suspect you\u2019re being actively tracked and must have the highest level of anonymity at the expense of browsing speed and website functionality.\nFor most users in their day-to-day browsing, Epic is likely a more natural choice since Epic is a browsing experience similar or even faster than your current browser \u2013 all the while providing great privacy.\nPlease note neither the TOR network nor the TOR browser can be considered secure as TOR network nodes are run by volunteers which include some malicious groups.\nMalicious TOR hosts are reported to have carried out serious attacks including one on a cryptocurrency website which resulted in tens of millions of dollars of losses to TOR users according to one report.\nFor even more privacy, TAILS which includes a TOR Browser is another tool to consider (though as mentioned above it's difficult to install and use).</p> How does Epic\u2019s built-in proxy protect my IP address? <p>Epic includes an encrypted proxy (essentially a built-in, free VPN) that lets you choose servers in eight different countries (the US, UK, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, France, India, and Singapore) via clicking on the icon at the top right of the address bar.\nUsing the proxy will route your browsing through a different IP address effectively hiding your actual IP.\nPlease note that plugins can leak your actual IP so for maximum privacy, via Epic's settings, set them to disabled or click-to-play.</p> Who powers Epic\u2019s proxy service? <p>For maximum speed and security, we run all the servers ourselves at present.</p> How can I uninstall the Epic Privacy Browser? <p>Windows users, please use the Windows Uninstall Programs.\nFor Mac users, simply drag the Epic Privacy Browser icon into your trash icon.</p> How does Epic protect against browser fingerprinting? <p>There is no agreed-upon way to prevent browser fingerprinting or device fingerprinting at this point.\nThere are many fingerprinting techniques which a solution would need to protect against.\nWhile we are working on a more thorough solution, at present Epic provides good protection against known fingerprinting scripts by simply blocking those scripts.\nEpic also directly blocks many prevalent fingerprinting methods including image canvas data, font canvas data, ultrasound signals, audiocontext, and battery status.</p> If Epic is free, how will the company sustain itself? <p>We expect to offer premium privacy services, sponsors on our new tab page, and search partners.</p> Is Epic Open Source? <p>All of Epic's code is visible and auditable by anyone.\nWe are committed to complete transparency (as you know from reading this page) about how Epic works and doesn't work.\nWe love open source software and Epic is built on open source Chromium.\nIf you would like to audit any files, please let us know.\nWe have released many files to developers who needed help -- so if you need help, just write us.\nIf you would like to contribute to Epic, please write us with your specific background and what you'd like to work on.\nWe'd love your help, but we've gotten many offers but no one has actually followed through with a contribution to date (it's okay, working on Chromium is hard :-).\nChromium which Epic is built on is open source software which anyone can immediately download and audit.\nNo one has written us regarding auditing chromium, but we'd love to hear ideas on how as a community we can continue to make sure Chromium is safe and private.\nIf you have any questions, please write us.</p> Why aren't so-called private search engines DuckDuckGo or Startpage offered in Epic? Why are you unable to trust them? <p>They wrote us often -- until we asked them to tell us how they worked.\nSince then, they've refused to tell us what data they send to their partners Google/Bing to retrieve search ads.\nIt's misleading to say you don't save any data if you're still sending it to other partners who are.\nClicking on their ads sends you and your data directly to Google or Bing which is not disclosed plainly to users by either search engine.\nIt's strange to call yourself a private search engine when your business model depends on sending your users' personal data to Bing or Google.\nWe're thus unable to believe they offer any meaningful privacy benefit versus using Bing, Google or Yahoo directly.</p> What happened to Epic's private search partnership with Google? Was Epic transparent about it and was it quite private? <p>Google annulled it a few years ago.\nYes, we were always transparent about how it worked and what data we shared.\nIt was highly private as to retrieve search ads and on ad click, we relayed a user's masked IP address to provide an approximate location.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-02-09 20:35:38.97968", "updated_at": "2021-04-07 20:13:04.545123"}, {"id": 4167, "name": "Privacy Policy", "url": "https://www.epicbrowser.com/privacypolicy.html", "xpath": "/html/body/div/div[1]/div[2]", "text": " <ol>\n<p> Privacy and transparency are important to us.\nEpic's mission is to provide fast, private and unfiltered internet access to our users.\nWe're writing this in plain english so it's very clear how Epic works.\nThis is to our knowledge the most honest privacy policy of any software company to date and we hope a model for others.\nAlmost all other privacy and other software companies may detail how they handle your data (that they don't save it), but they don't explicitly write about their partners or who they share your data with which may or may not be legally accurate but is still dishonest.\nWe have fought for years for true privacy and honesty and will continue to do so.\n<br>\n<br> We do not collect nor store nor share any personal or browsing data from the Epic Browser or usage of it.\nExcept for the video download and proxy services which are web services, the only data that is transferred either to or from your system to our servers are updates of the Epic Privacy Browser.\nUpdates never have any personally identifiable data, usage data, browsing data, or similar data.\n<br>\n<br> We do not store user, personal, browsing or other data in respect to our encrypted proxy or the video download web service.\nThe only indirect metrics we have about Epic usage are through our search partner data, minimal proxy bandwidth usage data (so we know when to add more servers), and through a count of the number of downloads.\nWhen you visit epicbrowser.com, our server does log your visit with minimal data and when you download epic, a counter is increased.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe do not share any data with Yahoo or its related entities, but they do support Epic through a search partnership.\n(Side Note: we held out for true, free private search as long as we could.\nWe simply couldn't continue to pay for development of Epic and the several hundred servers powering our encrypted proxy without this partnership and charging for the EpicSearch service at our scale.\nTrue, free private search is not possible today unfortunately, and we have written about that elsewhere.) As part of the contractual requirements of the search partnership, Yahoo search is white-listed from Epic's encrypted proxy.\nYahoo search and other Yahoo sites are white-listed from Epic's AdBlock.\nUpon ad click in Yahoo Search, both Epic's AdBlock and Proxy are disabled for several seconds.\nNo other sites are by default white-listed from either the Encrypted Proxy or AdBlock services.\n<br>\n<br>\nEpicSearch.in has no ads and is not white-listed from Epic's Encrypted proxy.\nIt sends only your search query to Yandex to retrieve search results and absolutely no other information.\nIt neither stores nor shares user or search data.\nIt is intuitively what one would expect from a private search engine.\n<br>\n<br>\nEpic is built on Chromium for Windows, Mac and Android and does remove all Google tracking and Google services.\nEpic for desktop does include the Widevine plugin which was acquired by Google and is required for video playback for many sites such as Netflix and others.\nIn order for Widevine to work, it does make a server call (to check for updates) often on open of the browser.\nThis is unavoidable according to their design of Widevine.\nWe never share any data with Google, are entirely independent, and have a minimal relationship with them due to Epic containing Widevine at this time.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe latest Agreement under which your
