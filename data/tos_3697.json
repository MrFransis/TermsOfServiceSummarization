resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms and Conditions (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Site will be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American

whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against us any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.\nThe laws of the State of New York will govern these Terms of Use, as well as any claim that might arise between you and us, without regard to any conflict of law

determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.\nDecisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.\nFor details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures .</p>\n<p>(b) Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to

those courts for such purposes.\nThese Terms and Conditions, and any dispute between you and us, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of law,

waiver of such right or provision.\nWe may assign these Terms and Conditions to any person or entity without your consent.\nYou may not assign these Terms and Conditions without our prior written consent.\nIf any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions remain in full force and effect.\nSections 1, 3-6, 9-14, 17-20 and any other provisions of
