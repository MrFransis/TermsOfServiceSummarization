that User feedback benefits the marketplace, all Users, and the efficiency of the Site and you specifically request that Upwork post composite or compiled feedback about Users, including yourself, on User Profiles and elsewhere on the Site.\nYou acknowledge and agree that feedback results for you, including your Job Success Score, wherever referenced, and other User Content highlighted by Upwork

between Users, as detailed below.</i>\n<b>3.1 SERVICE CONTRACTS</b>If a Client and Freelancer decide to enter into a Service Contract, the Service Contract is a contractual relationship directly between the Client and Freelancer.\nClient and Freelancer have complete discretion both with regard to whether to enter into a Service Contract with each other and with regard to the terms of any Service Contract.\nYou acknowledge, agree, and understand that Upwork is not a party to any Service Contract, that the formation of a Service Contract between Users will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Upwork and any User or a partnership or joint venture between Upwork and any User.With respect to any Service Contract, Clients and Freelancers may enter into any written agreements that they deem appropriate (e.g., confidentiality agreements, invention assignment agreements, assignment of rights, etc.) provided that any such agreements do not conflict with, narrow, or expand Upwork\u2019s rights and obligations under the Terms of Service, including this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions.\nThe parties to a Service Contract can, if the parties prefer, agree to the Optional Service Contract Terms in whole or in part, in addition to or instead of other such agreements.\nOnly to the extent that they have not entered into another agreement or terms with respect to a Service Contract, the parties to a Service Contract agree that the Optional Service Contract Terms apply to their Service Contract.The Optional Service Contract Terms are provided as a sample only and may not be appropriate for all jurisdictions or all contracts.\nUsers are responsible for complying with any local requirements, including applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\nUpwork does not assume any responsibility for any consequence of using the Optional Service Contract Terms.\nThe Optional Service Contract Terms are not intended to and do not (a) constitute legal advice, (b) create an attorney-client relationship, or (c) constitute advertising or a solicitation of any type.\nEach situation is highly fact-specific and requirements vary by situation and jurisdiction and therefore any party should seek legal advice from a licensed attorney in the relevant jurisdictions.\nUpwork expressly disclaims any and all liability with respect to actions or omissions based on the Optional Service Contract Terms.Please refer to the Upwork Payroll Agreement for Service Contracts using Upwork Payroll.<b>3.2 DISPUTES AMONG USERS</b>For disputes arising between Clients and Freelancers, you agree to abide by the dispute process that is explained in the Escrow Instructions that apply to your particular Service Contract.\nIf the dispute process does not resolve your dispute, you may pursue your dispute independently, but you acknowledge and agree that Upwork will not and is not obligated to provide any dispute assistance beyond what is provided in the Escrow Instructions.If Freelancer or Client intends to obtain an order from any arbitrator or any court that might direct Upwork, Upwork Escrow, or our Affiliates to take or refrain from taking any action with respect to an Escrow Account, that party will (a) give us at least five business days\u2019 prior notice of the hearing.\n(b) include in any such order a provision that, as a precondition to obligation affecting Upwork or Upwork Escrow, we be paid in full for any amounts to which we would otherwise be entitled.\nand (c) be paid for the reasonable value of the services to be rendered pursuant to such order.<b>3.3 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</b>Users may agree to any terms they deem appropriate with respect to confidentiality, including those set forth in the Optional Service Contract Terms.\nIf and to the extent that the Users do not articulate any different agreement with regard to confidentiality, then they agree that this Section 3.3 (Confidential Information) applies.To the extent a User provides Confidential Information to the other, the recipient will protect the secrecy of the discloser\u2019s Confidential Information with the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than due care.\nOn a User\u2019s written request, the party that received Confidential Information will promptly destroy or return the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information and any copies thereof contained in or on its premises, systems, or any other equipment otherwise under its control.<b>4.\nWORKER CLASSIFICATION AND UPWORK PAYROLL</b>\n<b>\n</b>\n<i>Section 4 discusses what you agree to concerning whether a Freelancer is an employee or independent contractor and when you agree to use Upwork Payroll, as detailed below.</i>\n<b>4.1 WORKER CLASSIFICATION</b>Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or should be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, franchisor/franchisee or employer-employee relationship between Upwork and a User.Client is solely responsible for and has complete discretion with regard to selection of any Freelancer for any Project.\nClient is solely responsible for and assumes all liability for determining whether Freelancers should be engaged as independent contractors or employees of Client and engaging them accordingly.\nClient warrants its decisions regarding classification are correct and its manner of engaging Freelancers complies with applicable laws, regulations, and rules.\nUpwork will have no input into, or involvement in, worker classification as between Client and Freelancer and Users agree that Upwork has no involvement in and will have no liability arising from or relating to the classification of a Freelancer generally or with regard to a particular Project.<b>4.2 UPWORK PAYROLL SERVICES</b>Client agrees to enroll in Upwork Payroll if it will receive services from a Freelancer under terms and conditions that would give rise to an employment relationship (unless Client elects instead to pay the Conversion Fee (see Section 7)).\nWhen the Client enrolls in Upwork Payroll, Client will engage Upwork\u2019s third-party staffing vendor (the \u201c<b>Staffing Provider</b>\u201d), which is an Agency on Upwork, through the Site.\nThe Staffing Provider will hire Freelancer at the request of Client and Freelancer according to the terms described on the Site and otherwise agreed to by the Staffing Provider and Client and/or Freelancer, and subject to the Upwork Payroll Agreement.\nFor all purposes with Upwork Payroll, the employer of Freelancer will be the Staffing Provider and not Upwork under any circumstances.Freelancer, acknowledges, understands, and agrees that Upwork will have no control over, or involvement in determining or influencing, the terms and conditions of any employment relationship that may arise between Freelancer and Staffing Provider or Client, including the selection of an employee, pay rate, work hours, employment dates and working conditions.\nFreelancer will not have any contract on the Site or contact with Upwork regarding such employment terms.\nWhere Freelancer and Client have enrolled in Upwork Payroll the Site is provided for, and Users agree to use the Site for, the sole purpose of enabling Freelancer to communicate with the Staffing Provider and the Client.\n<b>5.\nUPWORK FEES</b>\n<i>Section 5 describes what fees you agree to pay to Upwork in exchange for Upwork providing the Site and Site Services to you and what taxes Upwork may collect, as detailed below.</i>\n<b>5.1 FEES FOR FREELANCERS</b>\n<strong>Service Fees.</strong> Freelancers will pay Upwork a service fee for the use of the Site Services as set forth in the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement and the Direct Contract Terms, for using the Site Services, including the communication, invoicing, reporting, dispute resolution and payment services, including facilitating arbitration services and Hourly Payment Protection, as described in the applicable Escrow Instructions (the \u201c<b>Service Fees</b>\u201d).\nThe Service Fees (to use the Site Services) are paid solely by Freelancer.\nWhen a Client pays a Freelancer for a Project or when funds related to a Project are otherwise released to a Freelancer as required by the applicable Escrow Instructions (See Section 6.1), Upwork Escrow will credit the Freelancer Escrow Account for the full amount paid or released by the Client, and then subtract and disburse to Upwork the Service Fee.\nFreelancer hereby irrevocably authorizes and instructs Upwork Escrow to deduct the Service Fee from the Freelancer Escrow Account and pay Upwork on Freelancer\u2019s behalf.\nIn the event the Freelancer chooses to withdraw funds in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars, there may also be a foreign currency conversion charge imposed by Upwork Escrow or an affiliate and the rate may differ from rates that are in effect on the date of the payment and you may be able to obtain a better rate from your bank or financial institution.<br>\n<strong>Membership Fees and Connects.\n</strong>Freelancers may subscribe to different levels of participation and privileges on the Site to access additional features and Site Service, by payment of subscription membership fees and by purchasing \"Connects\" as described in and subject to the terms of the Freelancer Membership Agreement.<strong>Disbursement Fees.\n</strong>Freelancers will pay Upwork a disbursement fee for remitting payments to their preferred payment method (\u201c<b>Disbursement Fee</b>\u201d).\nThe Disbursement Fee is paid to Upwork in consideration of costs incurred and administration of disbursements via the disbursement method requested by Freelancer and varies by disbursement method.\nThe Disbursement Fee for each disbursement method is listed under Fees and Schedules on the Site as revised from time to time.In addition to fees charged by Upwork, your disbursement method may also charge activation, maintenance, or other account fees.<b>5.2 CLIENT FEES</b>Clients pay Upwork a fee for payment processing and administration related to the Freelancer Fees they pay to Freelancers they engage through the Site, as described in the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement.\nClients may also choose to pay for a premium membership plan to access additional features and Site Services, as described in the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement.\nClients do not pay fees if they use the Site solely for Direct Contracts.<b>5.3 VAT AND OTHER TAXES</b>Upwork may be required by applicable law to collect taxes or levies including, without limitation, withholding income tax or VAT (while some countries may refer to VAT using other terms, e.g.\nGST, we\u2019ll just refer to VAT, GST and any local sales taxes collectively as \u201c<b>VAT</b>\u201d) in the jurisdiction of the Freelancer (the \"<b>Taxes</b>\").\nIn such instances, any amounts Upwork is required to collect or withhold for the payment of any such Taxes shall be collected in addition to the fees owed to Upwork under the Terms of Service.<b>5.4 NO FEE FOR INTRODUCING OR FOR FINDING PROJECTS</b>\n<b>\n</b>Upwork does not introduce Clients to Freelancers and does not help Freelancers secure Projects.\nUpwork merely makes the Site and Site Services available to enable Freelancers to do so themselves and may from time to time highlight Projects that may be of interest.\nTherefore, Upwork does not charge a fee when a Freelancer finds a suitable Client or finds a Project.\nIn addition, Upwork does not charge any fee or dues for posting public feedback and composite or compiled feedback, including Composite Information.<b>6.\nPAYMENT TERMS AND ESCROW SERVICES</b>\n<i>Section 6 discusses your agreement to pay Freelancer Service Fees on Service Contracts, and describes how Upwork\u2019s Escrow Services work, what happens if a Client doesn\u2019t pay, and related topics, as detailed below.</i>\n<b>6.1 ESCROW SERVICES</b>Upwork Escrow provides escrow services to Users to deliver, hold, and/or receive

provides the Escrow Services described in this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions.\nUpwork Escrow is only obligated to perform those duties expressly described in this Agreement and any applicable Escrow Instructions.\nIf you authorize or instruct Upwork Escrow to release or make a payment of funds from an Escrow Account associated with you, Upwork Escrow may release or pay those funds as instructed in reliance on your authorization, this Agreement, and the applicable Escrow Instructions or as required by applicable law.<strong>Fixed-Price Projects.</strong> If Users choose fixed-price compensation, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Upwork Escrow will follow, the Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions.<strong>Hourly Projects, Bonus Payments, or Expense Payments</strong>\n<strong>.</strong> If Users choose hourly compensation, and/or if the Client makes bonus or expense payments, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Upwork Escrow will

they will be bound by, and Upwork Escrow will follow, the Direct Contract Escrow Instructions.<strong>Upwork Payroll Engagement</strong>\n<strong>s.</strong> If Users use Upwork Payroll (Section 4) for a particular Project, then the Staffing Employee is paid directly by the Staffing Provider.\nA Client will be invoiced through the Site by the Staffing Provider, and the applicable Escrow Instructions will apply.\nHowever, the Client will not be able to dispute hours reported by the Staffing Employee and there is no waiting period for the disbursement of funds to the Staffing Employee.<b>6.1.2 ESCROW ACCOUNTS</b>Upwork Escrow will use and release funds deposited in an Escrow Account only in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions.\nDepending on your needs and the applicable Escrow Instructions, Upwork Escrow will establish and maintain one of three different types of Escrow Accounts:(a) <strong>Client Escrow Account.\n</strong>After entering into a Service Contract, the first time a Client makes a payment for a Project, Upwork Escrow will establish and maintain a \u201c<b>Client Escrow Account</b>\u201d to hold funds for the Client to use to make payments for Projects, to receive refunds in connection with Projects, and to make payments to Upwork.(b) <strong>Freelancer Escrow Account.</strong> After entering into a Service Contract, the first time a Freelancer uses the Site to receive payment for a Project, Upwork Escrow will establish and maintain a \u201c<b>Freelancer Escrow Account</b>\u201d for Freelancer to receive payments for Projects, withdraw payments, make payments to Upwork and issue refunds to Clients.(c) <strong>Fixed-Price Escrow Account.</strong> When you enter into a Fixed-Price Contract, Upwork Escrow will establish and maintain a \u201c<b>Fixed-Price Escrow Account</b>\u201d to receive, hold, and release payments pursuant to the Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions for the Project that is the subject of that Fixed-Price Contract.(d) <strong>Direct Contract Escrow Account.</strong> When you enter into a Direct Contract, Upwork Escrow will establish and maintain a \u201c<b>Direct Contract Escrow Account</b>\u201d to receive, hold, and release payments pursuant to the Direct Contract Escrow Instructions for the Project that is the subject of that Direct Contract.You hereby authorize and instruct Upwork Escrow to act as escrow agent in connection with the Escrow Accounts and the payment, holding, and receipt of funds for each Project and other specified purposes in accordance with the Terms of Service and the applicable Escrow Instructions.\nClient and Freelancer may access current information regarding the status of an Escrow Account on the Site.<b>6.1.3 FREELANCER APPOINTMENT OF UPWORK ESCROW AND SUBSIDIARIES AS AGENT</b>If you are a Freelancer and you request payment related to an Hourly Contract or the release of funds from a Fixed-Price Escrow Account, you hereby appoint Upwork Escrow and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as your agent to obtain funds on your behalf and credit them to your Freelancer Escrow Account as applicable.\nBecause Upwork Escrow is Freelancer\u2019s agent, Freelancer must, and hereby does, fully discharge and credit Freelancer\u2019s Client for all payments and releases that Upwork Escrow receives on Freelancer\u2019s behalf from or on behalf of such Client.<b>6.1.4 TITLE TO FUNDS</b>Upwork, Upwork Escrow and our Affiliates are not banks.\nUpwork Escrow deposits and maintains all Escrow Account funds in an escrow trust account at a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and approved to receive, hold, and deliver escrow funds under applicable laws and regulations.\nThe escrow trust account is separate from the operating accounts of Upwork and each of our Affiliates.\nUpwork Escrow will not voluntarily make funds deposited in the escrow trust account available to its creditors, or the creditors of its Affiliates, in the event of a bankruptcy, or for any other purpose.\nAs provided in United States Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 541(d), Upwork Escrow holds only legal title to, and not any equitable interest in, the escrow trust account and any funds deposited therein.\nThis Agreement is supplementary to the Service Contract and to any other agreement between Client and Freelancer concerning the Project, as provided in 11 United States Bankruptcy Code, \u00a7 365(n).<b>6.1.5 NO INTEREST</b>You agree that you will not receive interest or other earnings on the funds held in your Escrow Account.\nUpwork, Upwork Escrow, or our Affiliates may charge or deduct fees, may receive a reduction in fees or expenses charged, and may receive other compensation in connection with the services they provide as provided in Section 5 and the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement.<strong>6.1.6 ESCROW AGENT DUTIES</strong>We undertake to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement, the applicable Escrow Instructions, and the other Terms of Service, and no other duties will be implied.\nWe have no liability under, and no duty to inquire as to, the provisions of any agreement, other than the Terms of Service, including this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions.\nWe will be under no duty to inquire about or investigate any agreement or communication between Client and Freelancer, even if posted to the Site.\nWe have the right to rely upon, and will not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon, any written notice, instruction, or request furnished to us by Client or Freelancer in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Escrow Instructions, if we reasonably believe that such notice, instruction, or request is genuine and that it is signed or presented by the proper party or parties.\nWe have no duty to inquire about or investigate the validity, accuracy, or content of any such notice, instruction, or request.\nWe have no duty to solicit any payments or releases that may be due to or from any Escrow Account.\nWe may execute any of our powers and perform any of our duties under this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions directly or through agents or attorneys (and will be liable only for the careful selection of any such agent or attorney) and may consult with counsel, accountants, and other skilled persons to be selected and retained by us.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be liable for anything done, suffered, or omitted in good faith by us in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants, or other skilled persons.\nIf we are uncertain as to our duties or rights hereunder or receive instructions, claims, or demands from any party hereto that, in our opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement or the applicable Escrow Instructions, we will be entitled to refrain from taking any action, and our sole obligation will be to keep safely all property held in the Escrow Account until we are directed otherwise in writing by Client and Freelancer or by a final order or judgment of an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction.<b>6.1.7 ESCROW AGENT RIGHT</b>We have the right, in our sole discretion, but not the obligation, to institute arbitration or, if no arbitration provision applies, other legal proceedings, including depositing funds held in the Escrow Account with a court of competent jurisdiction, and to resolve any dispute between Client and Freelancer related to the Escrow Account.\nAny provision of this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless whether we are identified as a party in interest in any dispute, arbitration, or other legal proceeding, nothing herein will be construed to limit our legal and equitable rights, including, but not limited to, depositing funds held in the Escrow Account with a court of competent jurisdiction.\nAny corporation or association into which Upwork Escrow may be merged or converted or with which Upwork Escrow may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all the escrow business of Upwork Escrow may be transferred will succeed to all the rights and obligations of Upwork Escrow as escrow holder and escrow agent under this Agreement and the applicable Escrow Instructions without further act to the extent permitted by applicable law.<b>6.2 CLIENT PAYMENTS ON SERVICE CONTRACTS</b>\n<strong>Hourly Contracts.\n</strong> Freelancer will invoice Client for Freelancer Fees on a weekly basis through Upwork, and Client will pay invoices consistent with the Hourly Escrow Instructions.\nWhen Client approves an Hourly Invoice for an Hourly Contract, Client automatically and irrevocably authorizes and instructs Upwork or its Affiliate, Upwork Escrow or Elance Ltd., to charge Client\u2019s Payment Method for the Freelancer Fees.<strong>Fixed-Price Contracts.</strong> Client becomes obligated to pay applicable amounts into the Escrow Account immediately upon sending a Fixed-Price Contract offer (for the full amount or for the first milestone, if milestones are used) or upon activating any additional milestone.\nWhen Client authorizes the payment of the Freelancer Fees for a Fixed-Price Contract on the Site, Client automatically and irrevocably authorizes and instructs Upwork or its Affiliates, Upwork Escrow or Elance Ltd., to charge Client\u2019s Payment Method for the Freelancer Fees.Client acknowledges and agrees that for both Hourly Contracts and Fixed-Price Contracts, failure by Client to decline or dispute an Hourly Invoice or request for payment is an authorization and instruction to release payment, as described more fully in the applicable Escrow Instructions.\n<b>6.3 DISBURSEMENTS TO FREELANCERS ON SERVICE CONTRACTS</b>Under the relevant Escrow Instructions, Upwork Escrow disburses funds that are available in the applicable Freelancer Escrow Account and payable to a Freelancer upon Freelancer\u2019s request.\nA Freelancer can request disbursement of available funds any time on a one-time basis or by setting up an automatic disbursement schedule.\nIf Freelancer does not request a disbursement, Upwork will automatically disburse available funds no more than 90 days after the Freelancer Fees are released to the Freelancer Escrow Account, unless the amount in the Escrow Account is less than the Minimum Threshold.\nFor purposes of the Terms of Service, a \u201c<b>Minimum Threshold</b>\u201d is either (a) $100 for Freelancers within the United States, or (b) $1,000 for Freelancers outside the United States.\nWhen the funds in the Freelancer Escrow Account are below the Minimum Threshold, the automatic disbursement schedule is paused and the available and payable funds are released on the earlier of: (i) Freelancer\u2019s request.\n(ii) on the first scheduled automatic disbursement occurring after the amount exceeds the Minimum Threshold.\nor (iii) 180 days after the funds are available in the Freelancer Escrow Account.<strong>Hourly Contracts.</strong> Freelancer Fees become available to Freelancers following the expiration of the dispute period and the five-day security period.\n<strong>Fixed-Price Contracts.</strong> Freelancer Fees become available to Freelancers following the expiration of the five-day security period after the funds are released as provided in the applicable Escrow Instructions.\nThe security period begins after Client accepts and approves work submitted by Freelancer.Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms of Service or the Escrow Instructions, Upwork Escrow, in its sole discretion and except as prohibited by applicable law, may refuse to process, may hold the disbursement of the Freelancer Fees or any other amounts and offset amounts owed to us, or take such other actions with respect to the Escrow Account as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion if: (a) we require additional information, such as Freelancer\u2019s tax information, government-issued identification or other proof of identity, address, or date of birth.\n(b) we have reason to believe the Freelancer Fees may be subject to dispute or chargeback.\n(c) we suspect a User has committed or attempted to commit fraud or other illicit acts on or through the Site.\n(d) we believe there are reasonable grounds for insecurity with respect to the performance of obligations under this Agreement or other Terms of Service.\nor (e) we deem it necessary in connection with any investigation or required by applicable law.\nIf, after investigation, we determine that the hold on the disbursement of the Freelancer Fees is no longer necessary, Upwork Escrow will release such hold as soon as practicable.In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms of Service or the Escrow Instructions and to the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to seek reimbursement from you, and you will reimburse us, if we: (i) suspect fraud or criminal activity associated with your payment, withdrawal, or Project.\n(ii) discover erroneous or duplicate transactions.\nor (iii) have supplied our services in accordance with this Agreement yet we receive any chargeback from the Payment Method used by you, or used by your Client if you are a Freelancer, despite our provision of the Site Services in accordance with this Agreement.\nYou agree that we have the right to obtain such reimbursement by instructing Upwork Escrow to (and Upwork Escrow will have the right to) charge the applicable Escrow Account, and any other accounts you hold with us, offsetting any amounts determined to be owing, deducting amounts from future payments or withdrawals, charging your Payment Method, or obtaining reimbursement from you by any other lawful means.\nIf we are unable to obtain such reimbursement, we may, in addition to any other remedies available under applicable law, temporarily or permanently revoke your access to the Site and Site Services and close your Account.<b>6.4 NON-PAYMENT</b>If Client is in \u201c<strong>default</strong>\u201d, meaning the Client fails to pay the Freelancer Fees or any other amounts when due under the Terms of Service, or a written agreement for payment terms incorporating the Terms of Service (signed by an authorized representative of Upwork), Upwork will be entitled to the remedies described in this Section 6.4 in addition to such other remedies that may be available under applicable law or in such written agreement.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Client will be deemed to be in default on the earliest occurrence of any of the following: (a) Client fails to pay the Freelancer Fees when due.\n(b) Client fails to pay a balance that is due or to bring, within a reasonable period of time but no more than 30 days after accrual of the charge, an account current after a credit or debit card is declined or expires.\n(c) Client fails to pay an invoice issued to the Client by Upwork within the time period agreed or, if no period is agreed, within 30 days.\n(d) Client initiates a chargeback with a bank or other financial institution resulting in a charge made by Upwork for Freelancer Fees or such other amount due being reversed to the Client.\nor (e) Client takes other actions or fails to take any action that results in a negative or past-due balance on the Client\u2019s account.If Client is in default, we may, without notice, temporarily or permanently close Client\u2019s Account and revoke Client\u2019s access to the Site and Site Services, including Client\u2019s authority to use the Site to process any additional payments, enter into Service Contracts, or obtain any additional Freelancer Services from other Users through the Site.\nHowever, Client will remain responsible for any amounts that accrue on any open Projects at the time a limitation is put on the Client\u2019s Account as a result of the default.\nWithout limiting other available remedies, Client must pay Upwork upon demand for any amounts owed, plus interest on the outstanding amount at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum interest allowed by applicable law, plus attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs of collection to the extent permitted by applicable law.At our discretion and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Upwork or its Affiliates, Upwork Escrow or Elance Ltd., may, without notice, charge all or a portion of any amount that is owed on any Account to Upwork or as Freelancer Fees or otherwise to any Payment Method on file on the Client\u2019s Account.\nset off amounts due against other amounts received from Client or held by for Client by Upwork, Upwork Escrow or another Affiliate.\nmake appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities.\nand cooperate with credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities in any investigation or prosecution.Upwork does not guarantee that Client is able to pay or will pay Freelancer Fees and Upwork is not liable for Freelancer Fees if Client is in default.\nFreelancer may use the dispute process as described in the applicable Escrow Instructions in order to recover funds from Client in the event of a default or may pursue such other remedies against Client as Freelancer chooses.\nIf Upwork recovers funds from a Client in default pursuant to this Section 6.4, Upwork will disburse any portion attributable to Freelancer Fees to the applicable Freelancer to the extent not already paid by Client or credited by Upwork through any Payment Protection program.<b>6.5 NO RETURN OF FUNDS AND NO CHARGEBACKS</b>Client acknowledges and agrees that Upwork or its Affiliates, Upwork Escrow or Elance Ltd., will charge or debit Client\u2019s designated Payment Method for the Freelancer Fees incurred as described in the applicable Escrow Instructions and the Fee and ACH Authorization Agreement and that once Upwork or its Affiliates, Upwork Escrow or Elance Ltd., charges or debits the Client\u2019s designated Payment Method for the Freelancer Fees, the charge or debit is non-refundable, except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nClient also acknowledges and agrees that the Terms of Service provide a dispute resolution process as a way for Client resolve disputes.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, Client therefore agrees not to ask its credit card company, bank, or other Payment Method provider to charge back any Freelancer Fees or other fees charged pursuant to the Terms of Service for any reason.\nA chargeback in breach of the foregoing obligation is a material breach of the Terms of Service.\nIf Client initiates a chargeback in violation of this Agreement, Client agrees that Upwork or its Affiliates, Upwork Escrow or Elance Ltd., may dispute or appeal the chargeback and institute collection action against Client and take such other action it deems appropriate.<b>6.6 PAYMENT METHODS</b>In order to use certain Site Services, Client must provide account information for at least one valid Payment Method.Client hereby authorizes Upwork, Upwork Escrow, and Elance Ltd., as applicable, to run credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by Client, to store credit card and banking or other financial details as Client\u2019s method of payment consistent with our Privacy Policy, and to charge Client\u2019s credit card (or any other Payment Method) for the Freelancer Fees and any other amounts owed under the Terms of Service.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to our Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agree that we may use certain third-party vendors and service providers to process payments and manage your Payment Method information.By providing Payment Method information through the Site and authorizing payments with the Payment Method, Client represents, warrants, and covenants that: (a) Client is legally authorized to provide such information.\n(b) Client is legally authorized to make payments using the Payment Method(s).\n(c) if Client is an employee or agent of a company or person that owns the Payment Method, that Client is authorized by the company or person to use the Payment Method to make payments on Upwork.\nand (d) such actions do not violate the terms and conditions applicable to Client\u2019s use of such Payment Method(s) or applicable law.\nWhen Client authorizes a payment using a Payment Method via the Site, Client represents and warrants that there are sufficient funds or credit available to complete the payment using the designated Payment Method.\nTo the extent that any amounts owed under this Agreement or the other Terms of Service cannot be collected from Client\u2019s Payment Method(s), Client is solely responsible for paying such amounts by other means.Upwork is not liable to any User if Upwork does not complete a transaction as a result of any limit by applicable law or your financial institution, or if a financial institution fails to honor any credit or debit to or from an account associated with such Payment Method.\nUpwork will make commercially reasonable efforts to work with any such affected Users to resolve such transactions in a manner consistent with this Agreement and any applicable Escrow Instructions.<b>6.7 U.S.\nDOLLARS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION</b>The Site and the Site Services operate in U.S.\nDollars.\nIf a User's Payment Method is denominated in a currency other than U.S.\nDollars and requires currency conversion to make or receive payments in U.S.\nDollars, the Site may display foreign currency conversion rates that Upwork, Upwork Escrow, or our Affiliates currently make available to convert supported foreign currencies to U.S.\nDollars.\nThese foreign currency conversion rates adjust regularly based on market conditions.\nPlease note that the wholesale currency conversion rates at which we or our Affiliates obtain foreign currency will usually be different than the foreign currency conversion rates offered on the Site.\nEach User, at its sole discretion and risk, may authorize the charge, debit, or credit of its Payment Method in a supported foreign currency and the conversion of the payment to U.S.\nDollars at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site.\nA list of supported foreign currencies is available on the Site.\nIf foreign currency conversion is required to make a payment in U.S.\nDollars and Upwork or its Affiliate, Upwork Escrow or Elance Ltd., as applicable, does not support the foreign currency or the User does not authorize the conversion of such payment at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site, Upwork Escrow or one of our Affiliates will charge, debit, or credit the User's Payment Method in U.S.\nDollars and the User's Payment Method provider will convert the payment at a foreign currency conversion rate selected by the User's Payment Method provider.\nThe User's Payment Method provider may also charge fees directly to the Payment Method even when no currency conversion is involved.\nThe User's authorization of a payment using a foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site is at the User's sole risk.\nUpwork, Upwork Escrow, Elance Ltd., and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a Payment Method denominated in a currency other than U.S.\nDollars.\nUpwork, Upwork Escrow, Elance Ltd., and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payments to and from the Escrow Account.<b>7.\nNON-CIRCUMVENTION</b>\n<i>Section 7 discusses your agreement to make and receive payments only through Upwork for two years from the date you first identify or meet your Client or Freelancer on the Site, unless you pay a Conversion Fee.\nviolating this Section 7 is a serious breach and your Account may be permanently suspended for violations, as detailed below.</i>\n<b>7.1 MAKING PAYMENTS THROUGH UPWORK</b>\n<b>\n</b>You acknowledge and agree that a substantial portion of the compensation Upwork receives for making the Site available to you is collected through the Service Fee described in Section 5.1 and that in exchange a substantial value to you is the relationships you make with other Users when you identify or are identified by another person through the Site or Site Services (the \u201c<strong>Upwork Relationship</strong>\u201d).\nUpwork only receives the Service Fee when a Client and a Freelancer pay and receive payment through the Site.\nTherefore, except as set out in Section 7.2, for 24 months from the start of an Upwork Relationship (the \u201c<strong>Non-Circumvention Period</strong>\u201d), you agree to use the Site as your exclusive method to request, make, and receive all payments for work directly or indirectly with that person or arising out of your relationship with that person and not to circumvent the Payment Methods offered on the Site unless you pay a fee to take the relationship off of the Site (the \u201c<strong>Conversion Fee</strong>\u201d).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, if you, or the business you represent, did not identify and were not identified by another person through the Site, such as if you and another User worked together before meeting on the Site, then the Non-Circumvention Period does not apply.\nIf you use the Site as an employee, agent, or representative of another business, then the Non-Circumvention Period applies to you and other employees, agents, or representatives of the business or its successor when acting in that capacity with respect to the other User.By way of illustration and not in limitation of the foregoing, you agree not to:\u2022 Offer or solicit or accept any offer or solicitation from parties identified through the Site to contract, hire, invoice, pay, or receive payment in any manner other than through the Site.\u2022 Invoice or report on the Site or in a Conversion Fee request an invoice or payment amount lower than that actually agreed, made, or received between Users.\u2022 Refer a User you identified on the Site to a third-party who is not a User of the Site for purposes of making or receiving payments other than through the Site.You agree to notify Upwork immediately if a person suggests to you making or receiving payments other than through the Site in violation of this Section 7 or if you receive unsolicited contact outside of the Site.\nIf you are aware of a breach or potential breach of this non-circumvention agreement, please submit a confidential report to Upwork here.You acknowledge and agree that a violation of any provision in this Section 7.1 is a material breach of the Terms of Service.\nYour Account may be permanently suspended and charged the Conversion Fee (defined above) if you violate this Section 7.1.\nIf you refuse to accept any new version of the Terms of Service or elect not to comply with certain conditions of using the Site, such as minimum rates supported on the Site, and therefore choose to cease using the Site, you may pay the Conversion Fee for each other User you wish to continue working with on whatever terms you agree after you cease using the Site.<strong>7.2 COMMUNICATING THROUGH THE SITE.\nNOT SHARING CONTACT DETAILS </strong>The provisions of this Section 7.2 apply to

Client disputes Freelancer\u2019s hours invoiced in the Hourly Invoice under an Hourly Contract during the Dispute Period, Client and Freelancer are encouraged to resolve the dispute between themselves.\nIf Client and Freelancer fail to come to a resolution, Upwork will promptly investigate the Hourly Invoice and determine, in our sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate

the proposed resolution.</li>\n<li>If Client or Freelancer rejects Upwork\u2019s proposed, non-binding resolution then Client and/or Freelancer must pursue the Dispute independently.</li>\n<li>Upwork reserves the right to review the Freelancer\u2019s work for 30 days prior to the date of the request for Dispute Assistance for compliance with Hourly Payment Protection requirements, and in its sole discretion, to make adjustments to invoices, and to direct Upwork Escrow to make appropriate releases to Client if it finds work that clearly does not relate Hourly Contract requirements or Client instructions in the Work Diaries or violations of the Terms of Service during its review of the work.</li>\n</ul>Dispute Assistance does not apply to Freelancer Services using Upwork Payroll.<b>8.\nNO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVICES OR PAYMENTS</b>Upwork and Affiliates merely provide a platform for Internet payment services.\nUpwork and Affiliates do not have any responsibility or control over the

week (Monday 12:00 a.m.\nmidnight UTC to Sunday 11:59 p.m.\nUTC) during the four days following the close of the weekly invoice period (Monday 12:00 a.m.\nmidnight UTC to Thursday 11:59 p.m.\nUTC) (the \u201cDispute Period\u201c).\nIt is Client\u2019s responsibility to review the Hourly Invoice of every Hourly Direct Contract on a weekly basis and to file any disputes during the Dispute Period.\nOnce the Dispute Period expires, Client will be deemed to have accepted the Freelancer Services and Freelancer Fees and can no longer dispute them.\nDisputes handled by Upwork can only address the hours billed, not the quality of the Freelancer Services or the Work Product provided under Hourly Direct Contracts.\nIf Client disputes Freelancer\u2019s hours invoiced in the Hourly Invoice under an Hourly Direct Contract during the Dispute Period, Client and Freelancer are encouraged to resolve the dispute between themselves.\nIf Client and Freelancer fail to come to a resolution, Upwork will promptly review the Hourly Invoice and determine, in our sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate consistent with Client\u2019s and Freelancer\u2019s instructions in these Escrow Instructions.\nUpwork's determination of such dispute shall be final unless Client and Freelancer pursue legal proceedings, in which case funds will be released according to the final order from which appeal is not taken in accordance with Section 5.1 of these Hourly Direct Contract Escrow Instructions.You acknowledge and agree that Upwork Escrow or its Affiliates may, at its sole discretion, withhold or delay payment in the event of dispute between a Client and a Freelancer.\nYou further acknowledge and agree that Upwork, Upwork Escrow, and other Affiliates are not and will not be a party to any dispute between a Client and Freelancer over an Hourly Invoice or Hourly Direct Contract.<br>\n<br>\n<b>7.\nNO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVICES OR PAYMENTS</b>Upwork and Affiliates merely provide a platform for Internet payment services.\nUpwork and Affiliates do not have any responsibility or control over the Freelancer Services that Client purchases.\nNothing in this Agreement deems or will be interpreted to deem Upwork or any Affiliate as Client\u2019s or Freelancer\u2019s agent with respect to any Freelancer Services, or expand or modify any warranty, liability or indemnity stated in the Terms of Service.\nFor example, Upwork does not guarantee the performance, functionality, quality, or timeliness of Freelancer Services or that a Client can or will make payments.<br>\n<br>\n<b>8.\nREFUNDS AND CANCELLATIONS</b>Client and Freelancer are encouraged to come to a mutual agreement if refunds or cancellations are necessary.\nIf there are no funds in escrow, Freelancer may issue a refund via the Upwork platform up to the full amount paid on the Hourly Direct Contract.<br>\n<br>\n<b>9.\nNOTICES</b>All notices to a User required by these Escrow Instructions will be made via email sent by Upwork to the User\u2019s registered email address.\nUsers are solely responsible for maintaining a current, active email address registered with Upwork, for checking their email and for responding to notices sent by Upwork to the User\u2019s registered email address.<br>\n<br>\n<b>10.\nABUSE</b>Upwork, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to suspend or

reside outside the United States, you are entering into this Agreement with Elance Ltd.<b>2.\nFees Charged to Freelancers</b>Pursuant to the User Agreement, we charge Freelancers a Service Fee for each payment their Client makes to the Freelancer on a Service Contract.\nDepending on certain features of the Service Contract, the Service Fees will be charged either as \"tiered\" or \"straight\" pricing, as discussed in further detail in this Section 2.\nWhere applicable, Upwork Global, Elance Ltd., or Upwork Escrow may also collect taxes (such as value added tax (VAT) in Europe) on Service Fees.Pursuant to the Freelancer Membership Agreement, we charge Freelancers a Membership Fee.\nThese Membership Fees automatically renew until they are cancelled as described on the Site.Additionally, the use of various Payment Methods offered through the Site and the Site Services may incur added fees or charges.\nAll Payment Methods will be posted on the Site along with any associated fees or charges, which we may update from time to time at our sole discretion.\nYou hereby authorize us to charge to you and to collect from you (consistent with this Agreement, the User Agreement, or elsewhere in the Terms of Service) any fees, charges, or taxes described in this Section 2.<b>2.1</b>\n<b>Tiered Pricing</b>We will charge you a Service Fee based on the total Freelancer Fees collected by you from your Client (less any refunds or reversals) for the duration of your relationship with your Client (the \u201c<strong>Engagement Relationship</strong>\u201d).\nUnless different pricing described in Section 2.2, 2.3, or 2.4 applies, the Service Fee rates decrease as the total Freelancer Fees you have collected from your Client for the Engagement Relationship meet certain thresholds as follows (\u201c<strong>Tiered Pricing</strong> \u201d):<b> TOTAL FREELANCER FEES COLLECTED FROM CLIENT</b>\n<b>(per Engagement Relationship)</b>\n<b> SERVICE FEE RATES</b>\n<b> $500.00 and below</b>\n<b> 20%</b>\n<b>$500.01 to $10,000.00</b>\n<b>10%</b>\n<b>$10,000.01 and up</b>\n<b>5%</b>\n<br>Below are some examples of Tiered Pricing.<strong>\n<i>Example 1.\nFixed-Price Contract.\nRepeat Service Contracts</i>\n</strong>If a Freelancer and a Client who have never entered into a Service Contract together before agree to a $600 Fixed-Price Contract, the Service Fee will be calculated as follows:<b>FREELANCER FEES </b>\n<b>SERVICE FEE RATES </b>\n<b>SERVICE FEES </b>\n<b>$500</b>\n<b>20%</b>\n<br>\n<b>$100 ($500 x 20%) </b>\n<b>$100</b>\n<b>10%</b>\n<br>\n<b>$10 ($100

Agreement are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not binding.\nBecause of rounding, the Service Fees charged may differ slightly.<br>If the same Freelancer and Client agree to <b>\n<i>another</i>\n</b> $600 Fixed-Price Contract, the Service Fee will be calculated as follows:<br>\n<b>FREELANCER FEES</b>\n<br>\n<b>SERVICE FEE RATE <br>\n</b>\n<b> SERVICE FEES</b>\n<br>\n<b> $600</b>\n<b> 10%</b>\n<b> $60 ($600 x 10%)</b>\n<b>\n<i>Total Freelancer Fees: $600</i>\n</b>\n<i>\n<i>\n<b>(Total Engagement Relationship Fees: $1,200)</b>\n</i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n<b>Total Service Fees: $60 </b>\n</i>\n<br>If the same Freelancer and Client enter into additional Fixed-Price Contracts for different Service Contracts, the Freelancer Fees for each Service Contract will count toward the total Freelancer Fees collected for purposes of determining the Tiered Pricing that applies to the Service Fees.\nIf the Freelancer collects $10,000 in Freelancer Fees from the Client, then the Service Fee on any additional Freelancer Fees for the Engagement Relationship with the Client will be 5% of the Freelancer Fees.\nFor example, if the Freelancer has collected a total of $15,000 in Freelancer Fees during the Engagement Relationship and the Freelancer and Client enter into a new Fixed-Price Contract for $1,000, the Service Fee would be determined as follows:<br>\n<b>FREELANCER FEES</b>\n<br>\n<b>SERVICE FEE RATE</b>\n<br>\n<b>SERVICE FEES</b>\n<br>\n<b> $1,000 </b>\n<br>\n<b>5</b>\n<b>%</b>\n<b>\n</b>\n<br>\n<b> $50 ($1,000 x

Fees will be calculated as follows:<br>\n<b>HOURS WORKED</b>\n<b>FREELANCER FEES</b>\n<b>(hours x freelancer rate)</b>\n<b>SERVICE </b>\n<b>FEE </b>\n<b>RATES</b>\n<b> SERVICE FEES</b>\n<b> First 10 hours</b>\n<b>$500 </b>\n<b>20%</b>\n<b>$100 </b>\n<b>190 <br>\n</b>\n<b>(Hour 11 to 200)</b>\n<b>$9,500</b>\n<b> 10%</b>\n<b>$950</b>\n<b>200 <br>\n</b>\n<b>(Hour 200 to 400)</b>\n<b>$10,000</b>\n<b>

not binding.\nBecause of rounding, the Service Fees charged may differ slightly.<br>\n<b>2.2 </b>\n<b>Freelancers Working on Enterprise Client Contracts</b>\n<br>If you are a Freelancer with a Service Contract entered into with an Enterprise Client, the Service Fee rate is 10% of the Freelancer Fees, unless otherwise provided in the Enterprise Client contract.\nIf you are a Freelancer with an active Contract with a Client whose Account is being converted to an Enterprise Client Account, then only on any Service Contract that is active at the time of the conversion, Upwork will honor the lower of (a) the Tiered Service Fee in effect at the time of the conversion, or (b) the Service Fee rate in the Enterprise Client contract for that Account.\nFor purposes of the Terms of Service, \u201c<strong>Enterprise Client</strong> \u201d means a Client, including a legacy Enterprise client or an Upwork Business Client, whose profile displays the following \u201cEnterprise\u201d badge:<br>\n<br>\n<b>2.3</b>\n<b>Alternate Pricing</b>\n<br>Alternate Pricing (defined below) only applies to Service Contracts when any of the following are true:(a) you entered into the Service Contract before Upwork first started charging Tiered Pricing;<br>(b) you entered into the Service Contract pursuant to a feature of the Site where we advertised a different Service Fee, such as our Featured Job Post for Clients.\nor(c) the Service Contract is with a Client who is not an Enterprise Client, but who has a legacy arrangement for lower fees that apply to the Service Contract.As described in this Section 2.3, if Alternate Pricing applies, we will typically charge you a Service Fee of a fixed percent (\u201c<b>Alternate Pricing</b> \u201d), as shown in the examples below.\nThe Service Fee under Alternate Pricing is a flat 10% unless other rates for Alternate Pricing are expressly communicated to you, including by communications through the Site.\n<b>CONTRACT

tiered fee rates (such as for a Featured Job Post), in each case as clearly stated on the Site at the time the Service Contract was or is entered into.\nWhen there is a different tiered fee rate, the initial rate will be as clearly stated on the Site, and once the Service Fees on the Engagement Relationship exceed $10,000, the Service Fee will be reduced to 5%, unless otherwise clearly communicated to you, including by communications through the Site.<b>2.4 Other Fees</b>Freelancers may also choose a membership with an associated membership fee (the \u201cFreelancer Membership Fee\u201d) and choose to purchase \u201cConnects\u201d, in each case as described in the Freelancer Membership Agreement and on the Site.<b>3.\n</b>\n<b>Client Membership Fees</b>\n<br>Upwork offers

(except for Background Technology as permitted by the Service Contract) contained in or on Freelancer\u2019s premises, systems, or any other equipment or location otherwise under Freelancer\u2019s

Client, Freelancer hereby automatically irrevocably assigns to Client all right, title and interest worldwide in and to such Intellectual Property Rights.\nExcept as set forth above, Freelancer retains no rights to use, and will not challenge the validity of Client\u2019s ownership in, such Intellectual Property Rights.\nFreelancer hereby waives any moral rights, rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal or inalienable rights under applicable law in and to the Work Product.\nIf payment is made only for partial delivery of Work Product, the assignment described herein applies only to the portion of Work Product delivered and paid for.<strong>6.5 LICENSE TO BACKGROUND TECHNOLOGY</strong>Upon Freelancer\u2019s receipt of full payment from Client for delivery

and publicly display in any form or medium, whether now known or later developed, make, use, sell, import, offer for sale and exercise any and all such rights.\nIf Freelancer has any rights to such Work Product that cannot be assigned or licensed, Freelancer hereby automatically, upon Freelancer\u2019s receipt of payment from Client, unconditionally and irrevocably waives the enforcement of such rights, and all claims and causes of action of any kind against Client or related to Client\u2019s customers, with respect to such rights, and will, at Client\u2019s request and expense, consent to and join in any action to enforce such rights.\nIf payment is made only for partial delivery of Work Product, the grant described herein applies only to the portion of Work Product delivered.<strong>6.7 ASSISTANCE</strong>Freelancer will assist Client in every way, including by signing any documents or instruments reasonably required, both during and after the term of the Service Contract, to obtain and enforce Intellectual Property Rights relating to Work Product in all countries.\nIn the event Client is unable, after reasonable effort, to secure Freelancer\u2019s signature on any document needed in connection with the foregoing, Freelancer hereby designates and appoints Client and its duly authorized officers and agents as its agent and attorney in fact to act on its behalf to further the purposes of this Section with the same legal force and effect as if executed by Freelancer.<strong>7.\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</strong>\n<strong>7.1

law that gives residents of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) more clarity and control over how their personal data is used.\nPersonal data is anything that can directly or indirectly identify a person, such as a photo, name, bank details, medical information, computer IP address, and so on.\nThis European-wide law replaces the 1995 Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC.The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a new data privacy law, effective January 1, 2020, that applies to certain businesses and is intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of

our users\u2019 privacy and their rights to control their personal data.\nRegardless of where you call home, you may close your account or request the deletion of all personal information we have about you at any time.\nHowever, we will only be following the requirements outlined by the GDPR and the CCPA for those living in the EEA and in California, respectively.\nIf you live elsewhere, we

REQUEST?</b> Depending on where you are located, you may have certain rights with regard to your personal information.\nThese rights may be limited, for example, if fulfilling a request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping (such as fraud prevention purposes or record retention requirements under applicable laws).\nIn addition, we typically will not remove information you posted publicly or shared with others through or on the Service, as neither you nor Upwork can delete all copies of information that have been previously shared with others on the Service.\nIf you would like to request to close your account in our system, you can do so

Upwork provides written notice of a price change at least 30 days before any renewal notice is due, in which case the pricing increase will be effective upon the commencement of the subsequent Renewal Term.\nBilling for any pricing increases will commence in the month following the renewal month in which the Order Form was renewed.<strong>\n</strong>3.3 <strong>Freelancer Service Fee</strong>.<strong>\n</strong>Upwork normally charges Freelancers a fee stated on the Platform.\nHowever, if a Freelancer is a BYO Freelancer or if the Freelancer is engaged via Upwork Payroll Services, Upwork will not charge such fee to the Freelancer for any work the Freelancer performs for Subscriber as a BYO Freelancer or via Upwork Payroll Services.<strong>\n</strong>3.4 <strong>Fees Related to Upwork Payroll Services</strong>.\nThe flat rate Service Fees set forth in the Order Form for BYO Freelancers and Platform Freelancers only applies to Freelancers located in the United

number(s).\nUpon request, Subscriber shall promptly provide Upwork with proof of direct Tax payments made to applicable authorities.\nSubscriber shall promptly pay or reimburse Upwork for all costs

purchase order to issue payment under this Agreement and Upwork has not received a copy of such purchase order, Upwork reserves the right to suspend Subscriber\u2019s access to the Platform until such purchase order has been received.\nIf Subscriber requires a valid purchase order number to be attached to or entered in an invoice submission to Subscriber\u2019s portal, but a valid purchase order has not been provided to Upwork in a timely manner, the net payment terms in the Service Order will be based on the date of the invoice generated by Upwork and not the date of invoice submission to

found on the Platform through a source other than Upwork within two years after the date that such Platform Freelancer is first engaged by Subscriber or, if never engaged by Subscriber through the Platform, within two years after the Platform Freelancer is first identified by Subscriber on the Platform, then Subscriber agrees to pay Upwork $10,000 for each such Freelancer.\nIf upon Subscriber\u2019s request, Upwork finds a Freelancer that was not on the Platform and Subscriber engages that Freelancer through a source other than Upwork, Subscriber agrees to pay Upwork $10,000 for each such Freelancer.\nThis provision does not apply to (i) BYO Freelancers or (ii) Freelancers responding independently and without direct solicitation to Subscriber\u2019s indirect solicitations (such as employment agency referrals and internet job postings).<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>TERM AND TERMINATION.</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>4.1 <strong>Term.\n</strong>This Master Subscription Agreement will

<strong>Post-Termination Obligations</strong>.If Subscriber\u2019s subscription to the Services or this Agreement ends early for any reason other than Subscriber\u2019s termination pursuant to Section 4.2 (Termination for Cause), then, in addition to other amounts Subscriber may owe Upwork, Subscriber will be responsible for paying any unpaid Subscription Fees associated with the remainder of the current Term.<strong>\n</strong>4.4 <strong>Effect of Termination and Survival</strong>.\nAs of the date either party provides notice of termination to the other, Subscriber will no longer be able to

completed, even if completion of the Final Engagement follows the termination date, unless otherwise agreed by the parties and the affected Freelancer(s).\nNotwithstanding any termination of this

Engagement</strong>.<strong>\n</strong>Upwork will, based on its worker classification, either: (i) engage the Freelancer as an independent contractor, (ii) hire the Freelancer as an employee through Upwork Payroll Services, or (iii) if the classification is neither employment nor independent contractor, for example the \u201cworker\u201d classification in the United Kingdom, Upwork will engage the worker consistent with applicable law.\nUpwork may delegate the Engagement of Freelancers (and other obligations regarding Freelancers under this Agreement) to one or more third parties.\nUpwork and Employment Provider reserve the right not to engage or hire a Freelancer in their sole discretion.\nUpwork will cause each Freelancer classified and engaged as an independent contractor to execute an Independent Contractor Agreement.\nUpwork (through Employment Provider) will cause each Freelancer classified and hired as an employee to execute an employment agreement containing confidentiality and intellectual property assignment provisions consistent with this Agreement.2.2.3 <strong>Custom Requirements</strong>\n<em>.</em> At Subscriber\u2019s request, if legally permissible and subject to separate fees, Upwork will establish and administer mutually agreeable custom onboarding requirements, including, if applicable, background checks and drug tests.<strong>\n</strong>2.2.4 <strong>Legal Compliance</strong>.<strong>\n</strong>Upwork, Employment Provider, or any third party acting to engage a Freelancer, as applicable, will comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the Engagement and payment of Freelancers.\nexcept that Upwork or Employment Provider shall not be liable for any non-compliance associated with any information provided by Subscriber.2.2.5 <strong>Work Protection Program.\n</strong>In connection with Engagements performed for Subscriber under this Agreement by Freelancers, Upwork will provide its Work Protection Program as described in this Section.\n2.2.5.1 <u>Freelancer Insurance Coverage.</u> Prior to the commencement of any Engagement with a project value of $75,000 or more based on the project value as stated in the project description or for Engagements that exceed $75,000 through the addition of milestones or as a result of the hours approved in a project extension by Subscriber, Upwork will verify that the Freelancer (or the Employment Provider for Engagements using the Upwork Payroll Service) has at least $1,000,000 USD of professional liability or errors and omissions liability insurance coverage in place unless this requirement is waived by Subscriber.\n<br>\n<br>2.2.5.2 <u>Dispute Process.</u> Before starting the Dispute Process (as described below), Subscriber shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any disputes with the Freelancer.\nTo start the \u201cDispute Process\u201d where Upwork will attempt to help Subscriber and the Freelancer resolve the dispute relating to Freelancer Services, Freelancer Work Product, or payment of Freelancer fees, for any Engagement(s), provided that for each such Engagement Subscriber shall (i) for milestone work, provide notice to Upwork by email that reasonably asserts in good faith that the Freelancer Work Product or Freelancer Services do not match the description of work product or services agreed upon, within seven days of acceptance of the milestone provided by Freelancer (or before acceptance of the milestone), or (ii) for hourly work, provide notice to Upwork by email that reasonably disputes in good faith the number of hours billed by the Freelancer within seven days of the earlier of (a) the acceptance by Subscriber of the hours worked by Freelancer, or (b) the end of the Subscriber Review Period (the deadline described in romanettes (i) and (ii), as applicable, are referred to herein as the \u201cWork Protection Dispute Deadline\u201d).\nEmails sent by Subscriber to Upwork in connection with the Dispute Process must be sent to work-protection-disputes@upwork.com.<br>\n<br>If Subscriber, with Upwork\u2019s assistance, is unable to resolve the dispute to its satisfaction, including specifically to recover amounts from the Freelancer in an amount satisfactory to Subscriber, Upwork will provide Subscriber with a credit to use on Upwork equal to the amount disputed in connection with the disputed Freelancer Services or Freelancer Work Product up to the total amount paid by Subscriber (including applicable Service Fees, but net of any monies returned or to be returned to Subscriber by the Freelancer) in connection with the disputed services or work product (the \u201cWork Protection Credit\u201d).\nprovided, however that Subscriber assigns in writing the right to Upwork to recover damages from the Freelancer.\nBy accepting the Work Protection Credit, Subscriber agrees that it thereby automatically assigns to Upwork the right to recover damages from the Freelancer to the extent of the amount of the Work Protection Credit.\nTo the extent that Subscriber is harmed beyond the amount of the Work Protection Credit, Subscriber retains the right to pursue recovery of any excess damages from the Freelancer.\nThe Work Protection Credit will be provided at the \u201cTeam\u201d level in Subscriber\u2019s account or to Subscriber\u2019s general account if no \u201cTeam\u201d exists and will expire upon the earlier of (a) three months after the provision of such credit in Subscriber\u2019s account or (b) termination of the Agreement.<br>\n<br>2.2.5.3 <u>Limitations on Work Protection.\n</u>The Work Protection Program does not apply to Freelancer Work Product or Freelancer Services provided by BYO Freelancers or in cases where Subscriber has waived the insurance requirement described in Section 2.2.5.1 (Freelancer Insurance Coverage).\nFor avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that (i) Freelancers are solely responsible for Freelancer Services and Freelancer Work Product.\nand (ii) the Work Protection Program is provided to Subscriber as a monetary remedy only and no guarantee is being made by Upwork with respect to Freelancer Work Product or Freelancer Services.\nNotwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Upwork (a) is not obligated to provide the credits described in this Section and may terminate this Agreement with 30 days prior notice to Subscriber if Upwork reasonably determines that allegations made by Subscriber under the Work Protection Program have not been made in good faith, and (b) is not obligated to provide the credits in this Section if Subscriber does not start the Dispute Process by the Work Protection Dispute Deadline.<br>\n<br>2.3 <strong>Program Management and Other Services</strong>.\nIf Subscriber requests Program Management Services from Upwork, then Subscriber authorizes Upwork personnel to access Subscriber\u2019s Upwork enterprise account and take actions on the Platform on behalf of Subscriber as directed by Subscriber, including without limitation, posting projects, creating Platform Content, preparing and offering contracts on the Platform to Freelancers, releasing payments, and closing such contracts upon completion of the work.\nAll actions performed by program management personnel in Subscriber\u2019s Upwork enterprise account will be considered to be actions by and at the direction of Subscriber.\nAny use by Subscriber of Program Management Services or other services listed on the Order Form will not alter, reduce or eliminate any Subscriber responsibilities under this Agreement.<strong>\n</strong>2.4 <strong>Affiliates</strong>.\nSubscriber\u2019s Affiliates are permitted to contract for Services and to use the Platform pursuant to the terms of this Master Subscription Agreement by either (i) directly entering into an Order Form with Upwork, which will be governed under the terms of this Master Subscription Agreement (an \u201cAffiliate Order Form\u201d) or (ii) if authorized by Subscriber, using the Platform as an Authorized User under Subscriber\u2019s account.\nBy entering into an Affiliate Order Form directly with Upwork under romanette (i), (a) Subscriber\u2019s Affiliate agrees to be bound by the terms of this Master Subscription Agreement as if a direct party hereto and all applicable terms that apply to \u201cSubscriber\u201d in this Master Subscription Agreement will be deemed to apply to the Affiliate for the purposes of its use of the Platform and Upwork\u2019s Services and (b) in the event that this Agreement terminates or expires with respect to the Subscriber, the terms of this Agreement will remain in effect for the Affiliate until the sooner occurrence of either the expiration of the Affiliate Order Form or termination by the Affiliate.\nBy authorizing an Affiliate to use Subscriber\u2019s account as an Authorized User under romanette (ii), (1) Subscriber agrees to be directly responsible for all costs and fees incurred by such Affiliate, which will be directly billed to Subscriber and (2) Subscriber will be responsible for its Affiliates\u2019 compliance with this Master Subscription Agreement.\nIf an Affiliate of Subscriber that establishes a relationship with Upwork under this provision ceases to be an Affiliate of Subscriber, then the relevant Affiliate Order Form will terminate with respect to such Services in accordance with Section 4.4 (Effect of Termination and Survival).<strong>\n</strong>2.5 <strong>Freelancer Services</strong>.<strong>\n</strong>2.5.1 <strong>Hourly Work for Independent Contractors</strong>.\nFor hourly work performed by Freelancers classified as independent contractors, Subscriber can dispute the Freelancer billing entries as described by this Section.\nThe Freelancer invoice will cover the billing period that begins Mondays at 00:00 midnight UTC and ends Sundays at 23:59 UTC (the \u201c<strong>Weekly Billing Period</strong>\u201d).\nFollowing each Weekly Billing Period, Subscriber has from Monday at 12 noon UTC until Friday at 23:59 UTC to review the Freelancer\u2019s billing records and file a dispute through the Platform if Subscriber disputes the hours billed by the Freelancer (the \u201c<strong>Subscriber Review Period</strong>\u201d).\nIf Subscriber does not file a dispute during the Subscriber Review Period, then (i) Subscriber will be deemed to have irrevocably approved the time billed and irrevocably accepted the work performed by the Freelancer during the time reflected on the Platform at the end of the Subscriber Review Period, and (ii) Upwork will be authorized and instructed to make payment to Freelancer for time reflected on the Platform.<strong>\n</strong>2.5.2 <strong>Hourly

overtime payments.\nFor Freelancers engaged by Upwork or Employment Provider as employees, Subscriber agrees to comply with all applicable laws (e.g., not requiring or encouraging any Freelancer to work without recording time, not discouraging or prohibiting Freelancers from taking any meal or rest periods authorized by law) and acknowledges and agrees that overtime wages are included in the Freelancer Payments and Costs to be reimbursed by Subscriber.<strong>\n</strong>2.5.3 <strong>Milestone Work</strong>.\nFor Engagements where Freelancer Payments are tied to completing milestones, Subscriber must approve or reject milestone approval requests through the Platform within 14 calendar days after such approval requests are submitted through the Platform.\nSubscriber acknowledges and agrees that in the event Subscriber fails to approve or reject a submitted milestone approval request within such 14 calendar day period, then (i) the Freelancer Services or Freelancer Work Product reflected in the milestone approval request will be deemed irrevocably accepted by Subscriber, and any payment associated with the milestone will be deemed irrevocably approved by Subscriber and (ii) Upwork will be authorized and instructed to make payment to Freelancer for such milestone.<strong>\n</strong>2.5.4 <strong>Arbitration with Freelancer</strong>.\nSubscriber understands that the

service tiers by opening a new contract on the new service tier and then closing the old contract on the old service tier.\nIf no end date is indicated on the old contract, the new contract will be established with a six-month duration.\nIn the event the old contract is either (i) a fixed price contract with no incomplete milestones or (ii) an hourly contract that has not had payments made under it over the past six months, then the old contract will only be closed on the old service tier and a new contract will not be entered into on the new service tier.\nSubscriber acknowledges that it may not be able to leave feedback for Freelancers for Engagements under contracts that are closed by Upwork pursuant to this provision.\nFor the purposes of this provision, \u201c<strong>Upgrade</strong>\u201d means Subscriber\u2019s election to utilize the Platform in a higher service tier and \u201c<strong>Downgrade</strong>\u201d means Subscriber\u2019s election to utilize the Platform in a lower service tier.\nFor Downgrades from a Compliance product, when a Freelancer contract is opened in the lower service tier as described in this Section, the new contract

be effective upon the commencement of the subsequent Renewal Term.\nBilling for any pricing increases will commence in the month following the renewal month in which the Order Form was renewed.<strong>\n</strong>3.3 <strong>Freelancer Service Fee</strong>.<strong>\n</strong>Upwork normally charges Freelancers a fee stated on the Platform.\nHowever, if a Freelancer is a BYO Freelancer or if the Freelancer is engaged via Upwork Payroll Services, Upwork will not charge such fee to the Freelancer for any work the Freelancer performs for Subscriber as a BYO Freelancer or via

any unpaid Subscription Fees associated with the remainder of the current Term.<strong>\n</strong>4.4 <strong>Effect of Termination and Survival</strong>.\nAs of the date either party provides notice of termination to the other, Subscriber will no longer be able to enter into new Engagements via the Platform.\nAll projects in a working status as of the date such notice is provided (each a

Arbitration Provision affects the Parties\u2019 ability to participate in class or collective actions.\nThe Parties agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others.\nThere will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (\u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d).\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the JAMS Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nIn any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.\nFreelancer will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of exercising any rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, if applicable, by filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum.\nHowever, any Party may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims.\n</strong>\n<strong>d.\nRight to Opt Out of the Arbitration Provision.</strong>\n<strong>Freelancer may opt out of the Arbitration Provision by notifying UTG in writing within 30 calendar days of the Effective Date.\n</strong>To opt out, Freelancer must send a written notification to UTG to Upwork Global Inc.\nheadquarters as listed on its Site

(d) Freelancer\u2019s telephone number, (e) Freelancer\u2019s email address, and (f) a statement that Freelancer wishes to opt out of the Arbitration Provision.\nFreelancer understands that Freelancer

</strong>\n<strong>Choice of Law.</strong> Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, this Agreement and any Claims will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).\nprovided, however, that any Claims by any Freelancer located within the United States will be governed by the law of the state in which such Freelancer resided at the time the Project was performed.\n<strong>16.2 Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nSection 15.3(c) governs severability of the Class Action Waiver.<strong>16.3 No Assignment</strong>.\nThis Agreement, and the Parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned or otherwise transferred by either Party without the other\u2019s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.\nprovided, however, UTG may assign this Agreement, its rights and its obligations to an affiliate or to any successor to its business or assets to which this Agreement relates, whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of stock, reorganization or otherwise.\nThe terms of this Agreement will be binding upon assignees.\n<strong>16.4 Injunctive Relief.\n</strong>Freelancer acknowledges that, because its services are personal and unique and because Freelancer will have access to Confidential Information of UTG and Upwork Client, any breach of this Agreement by Freelancer would cause irreparable injury to UTG or Upwork Client for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, will entitle UTG or Upwork Client to injunctive relief (including specific performance).\nThe rights and remedies provided to each Party in this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such Party at law or in equity not otherwise waived by this Agreement.<strong>16.5 Waiver.</strong> Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.<strong>16.6 Export.</strong> Freelancer agrees not to export, directly or indirectly, any U.S.\ntechnical data acquired from UTG, Upwork or Upwork Client, or any products utilizing such data, to countries outside the United States, because such export could be in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.<strong>16.7 Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the Parties with respect to such subject matters.\nNo modification of or amendment to this Agreement, or any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing and signed by Freelancer and UTG.<strong>16.8 Electronic Acceptance.\n</strong>The Parties expressly agree that this Agreement may be electronically signed and accepted, and that the Site\u2019s record of Freelancer\u2019s acceptance will be treated, for purposes of validity, enforceability and admissibility, the same as written

between applicable law and this Exhibit 1, Freelancer will comply with applicable law.\nPersonal Information includes any information related to an identified or identifiable natural person where such information is protected under applicable data protection law.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nNotification Of Security Incident:</strong> Freelancer will notify Upwork Client of any actual or suspected security incident involving Personal Information as soon as possible after becoming aware of the incident, but never later than 24 hours after learning of the incident.\nFreelancer will cooperate with

technical and administrative safeguards to protect Personal Information and comply at all times with applicable laws concerning the protection and securing of Personal Information.\nFor as long as

new passwords at least every 90 days;</li>\n<li>Ensure that multiple failed login attempts (no more than 10) to devices and applications result in lockout (check security settings on

overwrites data on the hardware.\npaper documents containing Personal Information will be shredded.\nDeleting files using standard keyboard commands is not sufficient because data may remain on the

the extent required by applicable law, take such reasonable steps as Upwork Client deems necessary (e.g., execute a data transfer agreement) to comply with any law in the country of origin that restricts the international transfer of Personal Information.</li>\n<li>Freelancer will cooperate with Upwork Client\u2019s reasonable request for assistance in responding to a request to Upwork

to Upwork Client so that Upwork Client can respond to the individual.</li>\n<li>Freelancer will make available, upon Upwork Client\u2019s reasonable request, information necessary to demonstrate

claim in arbitration.\nUTG will not retaliate against Freelancer for filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.<strong>b.\nInterpretation and Enforcement of this Arbitration Provision</strong>This Arbitration Provision is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of Claims and replaces all prior agreements between Freelancer and UTG regarding the arbitration of disputes covered by this Arbitration Provision.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision covers, and the arbitrator will have exclusive jurisdiction to decide, all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, enforcement, or application of this Arbitration Provision, including, except as otherwise provided in this Arbitration Provision, the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Provision or whether any portion of the Arbitration Provision is void or voidable.\nAll such matters will be decided by an arbitrator and not by a court.\nIn the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, the remainder of this Arbitration Provision will be enforceable.\nIf any portion of the Class Action Waiver in subsection c, below, of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be unenforceable, the Parties agree that this Arbitration Provision will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n<strong>c.\nClass and Collective Action Waiver</strong>\n<strong>Private attorney general representative actions under the California Labor Code are not arbitrable, not within the scope of this Arbitration Provision and may be maintained in a court of law.\nHowever, this Arbitration Provision affects the Parties\u2019 ability to participate in class or collective actions.\nThe Parties agree to bring any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis on behalf of others.\nThere will be no right or authority for any dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action, or as a member in any such class or collective proceeding (\u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d).\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the JAMS Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity or breach of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nIn any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class or collective action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class or collective action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration.\nFreelancer will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of exercising any rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, if applicable, by filing or participating in a class or collective action in any forum.\nHowever, any Party may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class or collective actions or claims.\n</strong>\n<strong>d.\nRight to Opt Out of the Arbitration Provision.</strong>\n<strong>Freelancer may opt out of the Arbitration Provision by notifying UTG in writing within 30 calendar days of the Effective Date.\n</strong>To opt out, Freelancer must send a written notification to UTG to Upwork Global Inc.\nheadquarters as listed on its Site (https://www.upwork.com/about/contact/), Attn: Legal or <u>legalnotices@upwork.com</u> that includes (a) Freelancer\u2019s account username, (b) Freelancer\u2019s name, (c) Freelancer\u2019s address, (d) Freelancer\u2019s telephone number, (e) Freelancer\u2019s email address, and (f) a statement that Freelancer wishes to opt out of the Arbitration Provision.\nFreelancer understands that Freelancer has the right to consult with counsel of Freelancer\u2019s choice concerning this Agreement and the Arbitration Provision.\n<strong>16.\nGENERAL PROVISIONS</strong>\n<strong>16.1 </strong>\n<strong>Choice of Law.</strong> Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, this Agreement and any Claims will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).\nprovided, however, that any Claims by any Freelancer located within the United States will be governed by the law of the state in which such Freelancer resided at the time the Project was performed.\n<strong>16.2 Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nSection 15.3(c) governs severability of the Class Action Waiver.<strong>16.3 No Assignment</strong>.\nThis Agreement, and the Parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned or otherwise transferred by either Party without the other\u2019s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.\nprovided, however, UTG may assign this Agreement, its rights and its obligations to an affiliate or to any successor to its business or assets to which this Agreement relates, whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of stock, reorganization or otherwise.\nThe terms of this Agreement will be binding upon assignees.\n<strong>16.4 Injunctive Relief.\n</strong>Freelancer acknowledges that, because its services are personal and unique and because Freelancer will have access to Confidential Information of UTG and Upwork Client, any breach of this Agreement by Freelancer would cause irreparable injury to UTG or Upwork Client for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, will entitle UTG or Upwork Client to injunctive relief (including specific performance).\nThe rights and remedies provided to each Party in this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such Party at law or in equity not otherwise waived by this Agreement.<strong>16.5 Waiver.</strong> Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.<strong>16.6 Export.</strong>Freelancer agrees not to export, directly or indirectly, any U.S.\ntechnical data acquired from UTG, Upwork or Upwork Client, or any products utilizing such data, to countries outside the United States, because such export could be in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.<strong>16.7 Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matters hereof and supersedes and merges all prior discussions between the Parties with respect to such subject matters.\nNo modification of or amendment to this Agreement, or any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, will be effective unless in writing and signed by Freelancer and UTG.<strong>16.8 Electronic Acceptance.\n</strong>The Parties expressly agree that this Agreement may be electronically signed and accepted, and that the Site\u2019s record of Freelancer\u2019s acceptance will be treated, for purposes of validity, enforceability and admissibility, the same as written signatures.<strong>THE PARTIES AGREE THAT BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT VIA THE SITE, FREELANCER HAS BOUND ITSELF TO THIS AGREEMENT AND CREATED AN AGREEMENT THAT IS ENFORCEABLE AGAINST ALL PARTIES.\n</strong>\n<strong>FREELANCER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FREELANCER HAS BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN INDEPENDENT LEGAL ADVICE WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT BEFORE ACCEPTING IT, AND THAT FREELANCER VOLUNTARILY AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF ITS TERMS.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>EXHIBIT A</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>Privacy

(a) for purposes of providing the Services and as otherwise instructed by Upwork Client, (b) in accordance with this Exhibit 1, and (c) in compliance with applicable law.\nIn the event of any conflict between applicable law and this Exhibit 1, Freelancer will comply with applicable law.\nPersonal Information includes any information related to an identified or identifiable natural person where such information is protected under applicable data protection law.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nNotification Of Security Incident:</strong> Freelancer will notify Upwork Client of any actual or suspected security incident involving Personal Information as soon as possible after becoming aware of the incident, but never later than 24 hours after learning of the incident.\nFreelancer will cooperate with Upwork Client on any investigation of the security incident.\nA \u201csecurity incident\u201d is a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nSecurity Standards:</strong> Freelancer will utilize reasonable and physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect Personal Information and comply at all times with applicable laws concerning the protection and securing of Personal Information.\nFor as long as Freelancer has access to Personal Information or to Upwork Client\u2019s systems/networks, Freelancer will update security practices and controls at Freelancer\u2019s own cost.</p>\n<strong>4.\nMalware Protection:</strong> Freelancer will use up-to-date, commercially reasonable virus protection software (i.e.\nanti-virus) for the duration of the Engagement.\n<strong>5.\nDevice and Software Management:</strong> Before the start of the Engagement and at all times while Freelancer accesses any Personal Information or Upwork Client\u2019s systems/networks, Freelancer will: <ol>\n<li>Use up-to-date software and firmware that includes any current patches and updates and that is configured to automatically update/patch;</li>\n<li>Use a

for access to devices and applications;</li>\n<li>Use password-activated screensavers to lock hardware or devices after a period of inactivity;</li>\n<li>Configure devices and applications to require new passwords at least every 90 days;</li>\n<li>Ensure that multiple failed login attempts (no more than 10) to devices and applications result in lockout (check security settings on applications).\nand</li>\n<li>Disable Bluetooth on devices (except when use is necessary).<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nSecure Practices: </strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Freelancer will only connect

Freelancer\u2019s possession (e.g., hard copies shredded, desktop/email trashcan emptied, etc.).\nPersonal Information in electronic form will be deleted with a \u201cwiping\u201d program that overwrites data on the hardware.\npaper documents containing Personal Information will be shredded.\nDeleting files using standard keyboard commands is not sufficient because data may remain on the computer\u2019s hard drive.\nWiping programs are available at most office supply stores.\nFreelancer understands that a failure to delete Personal Information in Freelancer\u2019s possession after completion of the Engagement may constitute theft of Personal Information.<strong>8.\nData Protection: </strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Freelancer will not disclose Personal Information to a subcontractor without Upwork Client\u2019s prior, written consent.\nFreelancer will not disclose Personal Information to any other third party without Upwork Client\u2019s prior, written consent except as required by

Personal Information made available to Freelancer by Upwork Client with any other data without the express authorization of Upwork Client.\n</li>\n<li>In the event Freelancer access to, or storage of, Personal Information results in the transfer of Personal Information to a country outside the country where the Personal Information originated, Freelancer will, at Upwork Client\u2019s request and to the extent required by applicable law, take such reasonable steps as Upwork Client deems necessary (e.g., execute a data transfer agreement) to comply with any law in the country of origin that restricts the international transfer of Personal Information.</li>\n<li>Freelancer will cooperate with Upwork Client\u2019s reasonable request for assistance in responding to a request to Upwork Client by an individual to exercise his or her rights under applicable data protection law, including but not limited to requests to delete Personal Information, and requests to access Personal Information.\nIn the event Freelancer receives such a request directly from an individual concerning Personal Information in Freelancer\u2019s possession, Freelancer will promptly forward the request to Upwork Client so that Upwork Client can respond to the individual.</li>\n<li>Freelancer will make available, upon Upwork Client\u2019s reasonable request, information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Exhibit 1 and will allow for audits or inspection by Upwork Client or its designee concerning Freelancer\u2019s handling of Personal Information in accordance with this Exhibit
