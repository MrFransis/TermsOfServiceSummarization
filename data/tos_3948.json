referred to as \"Boardhost\") Flagcounter.com service's counters, facilities, and services (collectively the \"Service\").\nIn consideration for your right to use the Service, you agree as follows: <br>\n<br>\n<b>SERVICE PROVIDED</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nBoardhost provides the capability of creation and/or use of website counters, to the user, who is at least eighteen (18) years old, or is a minor over the age of thirteen (13) who has parental permission.\nService is provided \"as is.\" There may, among other things, be unexpected downtimes, loss of data, delays or interruptions of service.\nBOARDHOST SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES YOU MAY SUFFER AS A RESULT OF SUCH INTERRUPTIONS OR DATA LOSSES, OR OTHERWISE AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOSS OF BUSINESS.\nFURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you create a counter, Boardhost may provide an HTML and/or Javascript code for you to include on your website (or any other page where you include such code, hereafter referred to simply as \"Your website\") to use certain features that we provide.\nBoardhost cannot guarantee that such code will not interfere with other elements of Your website or that such coding will at all times work as described.\nYou may not modify provided codes in any manner and you may not intentionally conceal the visual display of your counter from Your website.\nYou further may not remove the link leading back to your counter's statistical information.\n</p>\n<p>\nBoardhost is not obligated to monitor the Service, but may do so and may remove or edit any counter created through our site, or adjust your access to the Service.\nCounters that Boardhost may, in its sole discretion, elect to remove or edit include without limitation those which violate the \"Restrictions\" enumerated herein.\n</p>\n<p>\nCounters and their content are provided for entertainment only, and their content is subject to error and innaccuracies.\nWe cannot guarantee, for instance, that the counts indicated represent anything other than a minimum number of times the counter was loaded from our server, nor can we guarantee the accuracy of the originating country and/or other information assigned to an individual visitor.\nFurther, your counter code could be placed elsewhere on the Internet by automated robots or by unscrupulous or other third parties.\nSuch placement may result in a distortion of your intended count of visitors.\n</p>\n<p> Counters provided through our service can only count visitors that directly load the associated image from our server.\nModifications to your code and/or the functionality of your code, and/or the implementation of proxy servers, advertisement blocking or other software on Your website or by Your website's visitors may result in incorrect information and/or limited or no information being recorded.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou agree that if your counter is or is expected to be viewed more than 5,000,000 times in a single month, to contact us to ensure that adequate resources are available.\nIf you do not recieve our written confirmation of such, your counter may be temporarily or permanently deactivated until such resources become available.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou may not place your counter on websites of which you do not own or operate, or which you have obtained permission from the person who does own or operate the site.\nYou further may not include your counter in \"comments\" to sites that you do not own or operate.</p>\n<p> Boardhost may place advertisements on any counters created on our site, and on associated information pages, in exchange for the service provided.\nIt is Boardhost's sole discretion as to how many advertisements appear, and the form of these advertisements.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>RESTRICTIONS</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou may use our Service for legal purposes only, and further may not use our Service on any website that contains or promotes any

allowed to use our site.\nAny reported incident of spamming, or any form of unsolicited e-mail or newsgroup posting that includes a link to or references to a counter or its associated content, may result in IMMEDIATE termination of any related counters, and a ban from using any future Boardhost services.<br>\n<br>\nFurthermore, you may not include a counter in ANY e-mail message, including but not limited to e-mail newsletters.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>TERMINATION</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nBoardhost reserves the right to terminate, or take steps to terminate your counters and/or access to the Service, in whole or part, without warning, for any reason at its sole discretion, including without limitation any violation of a provision of these terms.\nBoardhost further reserves the right to remove any counters or accounts determined in Boardhost's sole discretion to be using excessive server resources.<br>\n<br>\nAny counters you create and their associated data may be removed for inactivity at Boardhost's discretion.\nOrdinarily, this will occur if your counter has not had a new visitor in over 30 days.\n<br>\n<br>\nShould any credit or debit card or other payment method used to pay for Boardhost's services be rejected or should your card issuer (or its agent or affiliate) seek return of payment previously made to Boardhost where Boardhost believes you are liable for the charge, your Service will be immediately terminated and you will be barred from using our services in the future.\nSuch rights are in addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available to

need to share your information with our billing provider to process the payment, prevent fraud, or resolve disputes regarding your payment.</li>\n<li> We may disclose information in certain

necessitating such disclosure.</li>\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>We do not utilize a promotional mailing list of any kind.</u> We will use your email address only to provide requested assistance or information, to remind you of an upcoming billing renewal, or to provide information that may be required by law or that may materially affect your usage of our services.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY A FLAG COUNTER</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>A Flag Counter image itself placed on a website does not collect personally identifiable information</u>.\nWe are not able to determine whether a particular person has viewed a particular counter.\nThe counter collects the minimum information that we believe is necessary to provide our service.</b>\n<br>\n<br> A Flag Counter displays information about the countries and/or regions that have viewed a particular counter publicly, as is its purpose.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur counter service is a simple image.\nWhen an image loads from our server, the visitor's web browser automatically provides us with certain information including the visitor's IP address, the URL of the referring page (where the image was placed), and the user-agent string of the visitor (which ordinarily contains the type and version of a visitor's web browser and operating system).\nHowever, the information we log is limited.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhen the image is requested, our service queries a third-party company's database which is locally hosted on our servers (no information is transmitted to the third-party company.\nOur service does not use GPS nor do we request or have access to a visitor's precise location).\nThis allows us to determine the country and/or region most likely associated with a particular visitor's IP address, at which time that country and/or region is added as a visit to the counter.\n<br>\n<br>\nTo prevent a returning visitor from repeatedly adding to a counter's statistics, a combination of the visitor's IP address and the particular counter's username are converted to an encrypted hash (which we cannot reverse), and then the hash itself is placed into a filter (for up to seven days after which it is erased).\nThis method allows our counters to operate without the use of cookies.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>We do not log IP addresses of a counter's visitors or otherwise associate them with a particular visit.</u>\n</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Counters provided as part of our free service:</u>\n<br>\nMost of our customer use free counters.\nFree counters do not log any information.\nThese counters only add information to a tally of the visitor counts we have associated with a particular country/region and/or date.\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>Counters provided as part of our paid Flag Counter Pro service:</u>\n<br>\nSome of our customers have upgraded to our paid Flag Counter Pro service.\nWhen an upgraded counter loads, it will log the visit's referring page URL (as provided by their browser<sup>1</sup>), the detected country and/or region of the visitor, and the visitor's web browser (such as Firefox) and operating system (such as Windows 10) as indicated in the visitor's user-agent string.\nthis limited logged information is made available for a period of up to 90 days.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>We do not build profiles on a counter's visitors nor do we attempt to track or associate visitors from one counter to another.\nThe Flag Counter image does not use cookies.\nAdding the counter to your website will not cause any cookies or advertising on your website itself.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<sup>1</sup>To prevent recording a potential leakage of personal information from third-party sites, <u>query strings</u> are automatically stripped from a referring page URL.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>CORRESPONDENCE WITH US</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nCorrespondence received from customers of our service (who identify themselves as such) regarding their account will ordinarily not be revealed to third parties, except as we deem in our sole discretion, necessary for us to address any issues raised in or by such correspondence, or as required by law.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you're contacting us about someone else's account, your correspondence may be revealed to that customer, or to other third-parties at our sole discretion (even if the third-party contacting us is also our customer).\nFor instance, if we receive a complaint regarding a customer's account, we may reveal that complaint to the account holder, so that they may address the situation.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>UPDATING OR REMOVING YOUR INFORMATION</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you have created a counter and you do not use your counter, after 30 days of it not recording a new visitor, it will automatically be removed from our service to make room for our active customers.\nAny information associated with the counter will be erased.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you registered your counter, you have access to the Flag Counter Management section, where your information can be updated, or your counter and all of its information erased.\nOther updates and/or removals can be requested by <u>contacting us</u>.\nWe will respond within 30 days, and may request information sufficient for us to verify that you are inquiring about your own information.\n<br>\n<br>\nPlease note that most information requested and stored by us is the minimum necessary for us to provide services to you, therefore if you request that your information be removed, you may not be able to use our services.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>REVIEWING YOUR INFORMATION</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you created and maintain an active free counter, it is likely that the only information we have about you in our records is your email address.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you have upgraded to our Flag Counter Pro service, we may also have credit card or billing information.<br>\n<br>\nIf you are interested in reviewing your information, please <u>contact us</u>.\nWe will respond within 30 days, and may request information sufficient for us to verify that you are inquiring about your own information.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>OUR WEBSITE USES THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING AND
