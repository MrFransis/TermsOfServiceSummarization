phones Networks Address your every network need Go to networks Cookies Cookies and how we use them\n<p>This policy details how Nokia uses cookies and cookie-like files and technologies on its websites, e.g.\nLocal Shared Objects, also known as \u201cFlash cookies\u201d, web beacons etc.\nWe refer to these generically as \u201ccookies\u201d.\nIf you visit our websites and your browser settings accept cookies, we consider this as acceptance of our use of cookies.</p>\n&nbsp.\nWhat are cookies and how do they work?\n<p>Cookies are small files that are sent to and stored in your computer by the websites you visit.\nCookies are stored in your browser\u2019s file directory.\nNext time you visit the site, your browser will read the cookie and relay the information back to the website or element that originally set the cookie.\nTo learn more about these technologies and how they work, please see e.g.\nallaboutcookies.org.</p>\n&nbsp.\nWhy does Nokia use cookies?\n<p>At Nokia domains, we use cookies to offer you a smoother experience.\nView your options for managing cookies in the next chapter.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Basic functions</strong>\n<br>\nThese cookies are essential for running our web sites and are the key to providing you a seamless experience.\nYou can navigate uninterrupted e.g.\nby remembering language and country choices you\u2019ve made and by preserving authentication to secure parts of the domain.\nThese cookies also remember products of interest when you are redirected to an Operator site for a possible purchase.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Site improvement</strong>\n<br>\nThese cookies enable us to improve our websites by looking at how they are used.\nWe do analytical profiling to understand e.g.\nunique users reading a particular article (to know what is popular) or if a video file was viewed or abandoned half way through.\nWe also look at where content is accessed so we know how to arrange our sites for optimal user experience.\nWe count clicks on \u201cLike\u201d and \u201cTweet\u201d plugins and what content from our sites was shared or referenced.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personalization</strong>\n<br>\nThese cookies help make the content as personalised as possible, for example by showing you targeted banners and relevant recommendations.\nWe examine what type of reference was used to reach our sites, e.g.\nan email campaign or a link from a referral site, so we can estimate the effectiveness of our promotions and advertising campaigns.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising</strong>\n<br>\nWe use these cookies to dynamically serve Nokia ads on both Nokia and selected third party websites.</p>\n<p>Our domains may also include elements that set cookies on behalf of a third party, e.g.\na \u201cLike\u201d-button from Facebook or a \u201cTweet\u201d-button from Twitter.</p>\n&nbsp.\nHow can I manage cookies?\n<p>You can review the options available to manage cookies in your browser.\nThe browser can be used to manage cookies relating to basic functions, site improvement, personalisation and advertising.\nDifferent browsers use different ways to disable cookies, but they are usually found under a Tools or Options menu.\nYou can also consult the browser\u2019s help menu.\nIn addition to cookie management, browsers usually let you control files similar to cookies, for example Local Shared Objects, e.g.\nby enabling the browser\u2019s privacy mode.\nNokia uses third party vendor managed advertising cookies to promote its products in both Nokia and non-Nokia web sites.\nYou may be able to opt-out from certain third party managed advertising cookies through third party cookie management sites.</p>\n<p>For more information about cookies, please review our current&nbsp;cookie list.</p>\n<p>Disabling cookies may prevent you from using certain parts of Nokia websites.\nIf you delete your cookies from the browser, you may need to remember to re-install opt-out cookies.</p>\n&nbsp.\nHow long do we keep the information?\n<p>It depends based on the type of cookies.\nSession cookies expire when you close the browser.\nPersistent cookies, including Local Shared Objects (\u201cFlash cookies\u201d), have typical expiration dates ranging from two months up to a couple of years.</p>\n&nbsp.\nWhat else should you know?\n<p>Nokia may from time to time change this Policy.\nHowever, if this Policy is changed in a material, adverse way, Nokia will post a notice advising of such change at the beginning of this Policy and on this site's home page.\nWe recommend that you re-visit this Policy from time to time to learn of any such changes to this Policy.</p>\n<p>If you have additional questions, please contact us by writing to:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Karakaari
