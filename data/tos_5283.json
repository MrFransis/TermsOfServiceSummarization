surveys.</p>\n<p>\u2022 &nbsp;You act as the data controller to the survey respondents.&nbsp;We enable you to communicate your compliance statements regarding data handling and privacy.\nAs such, you are responsible for honoring respondent requests under EU privacy regulations.</p>\n<p>\u2022 &nbsp;We act as a data processor to respondents.\nOur platform enables you to securely collect respondent

for your name and contact information, including: company name, name of contact, title of contact, company address, telephone number, email address, user name and password, and billing information which may include credit card numbers.\nWe don\u2019t store any credit card information, instead we use a third-party service as a credit card processor.\nCustomers also provide us with information regarding the ordered Services (e.g., the type of account plan Customers pay for, account preferences, use of survey options or preferences, etc.).\nIn addition to the information you actively provide to us, we also collect information from other sources regarding when and how often you log on to our Site.\n(See \u201cTracking Technologies\u201d below.) Information collected is processed by contracted 3rd&nbsp;parties to assist with accounting, customer management, and compliance.\nAll customer data transfers from Alchemer to third parties require a data processing addendum which restricts how the information may be used.</p>\n<p>We will not \u2014 under any circumstances \u2014 sell or rent Customer or Respondent Information to any third party.</p>\n<p>Respondent Information:&nbsp;We receive Respondent Information from survey respondents.\nIf you\u2019re using our email campaign distribution method, you provide us with the email address, and optionally other contact information, of each Respondent.\nBefore receiving that information, we contractually require the Customer to warrant that it has a pre-existing relationship with the Survey Respondent and/or the Survey Respondent\u2019s permission to receive electronic messages.\nWe reserve the right to identify you as the person who has made the referral in any message that is sent to them.\nPermission is considered to be granted when a contact has asked to be subscribed to a list and an email is sent to confirm the validity of the email.\nThis \u201cdouble opt-in\u201d process ensures that all contacts have been given permission to receive bulk email and that they have provided a valid email address that will not result in bounced messages or SPAM abuse reports.</p>\n<p>Survey Respondents provide us with the information requested by you (for example, if your survey question asks about the respondent\u2019s gender or zip code) as well as all answers to the survey questions.\nCustomers are solely responsible for the content of the surveys and response data as well as complying with all applicable laws and regulations that might apply to the content that is solicited by Customers, as we state in our&nbsp;Terms of Service.\nAs one of our software features for our Customers, we can record: (i) if and when a Survey Respondent has responded to a survey and (ii) if and when a Survey Respondent has received a reminder.\nIn addition, we receive any information contained in any communications a Survey Respondent makes directly with Alchemer.\n(See \u201cTracking Technologies\u201d below.)</p>\n<p>We will not \u2013 under any circumstances \u2013 use Respondent Information for any purpose other than to provide services to our Customers.</p>\n<p>We log Customer and Survey Respondent Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to confirm the accuracy of survey data and Survey Respondent IP addresses are also converted into&nbsp;geo-data&nbsp;for Customers within our software.\nFor our software system administration purposes, we also log a user\u2019s session so that we know when, how often and what pages of the Site a user visits.\nTo avoid the need to re-insert your username and password every time you and your Survey Respondents move from one page of our Site to the next, we use a cookie.\n(See \u201cTracking Technologies\u201d below.) We also collect information from our Customers and Respondents regarding the devices and applications used to access our services (like browser type and operating system) and referral sources (if you arrived from another website or email).</p>\n<p>You can login to our site using third party sign-in services such as Google Accounts Authentication and Authorization.\nThese services authenticate your identity and give you the choice to share certain types of personal information with us (like your name and email address) to pre-populate your login.</p>\n<p>Our site includes social media features as part of our distribution methods.\nThese features, including the Facebook Post or Twitter Post buttons, may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nThese features are hosted by a third party social media network (like Twitter or Facebook).\nYour interactions with these features are governed by those third party social media networks\u2019 privacy policies.</p>\n<p>Customers collect information using our software services platform.\nAs a service provider for our Customers, Alchemer acts as a custodian for that information.\nAlchemer provides features and services for Customers to provide notice to their end users or customers concerning the legal accountability for the collection of information.\nTo protect the privacy of our Customers, we cannot disclose private information to end users regarding our Customers\u2019 accounts.</p> Tracking Technologies We Use on Our Site and Services Platforms <p>\n<strong>Please read our Cookie Policy here.</strong>\n</p> Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) <p>Our customers can use software features that will enable clear gifs (a.k.a.\nWeb Beacons/Web Bugs) in survey distribution email campaigns to Survey Respondents.\nClear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.\nIn contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>\n<p>Alchemer also uses clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to you our customers and users to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nIf you would like to opt-out of promotional emails, please follow the unsubscribe instructions included in

messages.\nWe are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums or blog comments.</p> How we use the information we collect <p>We use Customer Information in our normal course of business, including to contact you regarding technical support, discuss billing issues, or to bring to your attention any aspect of our mutual business.\nWe may also use your contact information to provide you with policy or product updates or to introduce new products and services provided you have indicated that you do not object to being contacted for these purposes.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to receive promotional emails from us, you can tell us not to either at the point such information is collected (by checking or unchecking (as directed) the relevant box) or by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.\nWe send service-related announcements when necessary to do so, and generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.</p>\n<p>All Respondent Information is stored in our databases for our Customers\u2019 benefit.\nAt your direction, we use a Survey Respondent\u2019s email address (and at your option other contact information) to send survey invitations, reminders, and whatever other communications you choose to use.\nWe also use Respondent Information to improve the performance of our Site and services by analyzing site and user behavior, troubleshooting technical problems, resolving disputes and addressing complaints, and addressing compliance issues with our Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>We require our Customers to warrant their compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 of the US and equivalent legislation in Europe and elsewhere, and we may have additional approval processes surrounding email campaigns.\nWe also have a software program that alerts us about certain kinds of illegal or dangerous behavior in accounts that violates our&nbsp;Terms of Service.\nHowever, we don\u2019t provide monitoring services to you, on your behalf, or otherwise search or monitor for illegal or illicit or other behavior in your account that may violate our&nbsp;Terms of Service.\nAs part of our&nbsp;Terms of Service&nbsp;our Customers maintain and warranty sole responsibility over their behavior, use of our software platform, and whatever content is inserted into or solicited by our software.\nWe make no representations or warranty over our Customers\u2019 use of our services, nor do we control our Customers\u2019 behaviors.\nIf you think there may be any violations of our Terms, please report it to us at&nbsp;compliance@alchemer.com.</p>\n<p>We collect information on behalf of our Customers, just like the Post Office sending and receiving mail on behalf of individuals.\nIf you are an end user or customer of one of our Customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our service, please contact that Customer directly.</p> Our Staff\u2019s Access to Information <p>Our staff will only access your data at a minimum necessary standard, in order to provide technical or administrative support.\nFor instance, if you open a support ticket, hire our consulting services, call our telephone support, or your account is flagged for a security reason, then our staff may log into your account for the purpose of troubleshooting and correcting the reported issue or performing their contracted task.\nWe will not for any reason disseminate your data other than as you have directed (e.g.\nemail actions, sending reports, etc.).\nAll your data is subject to the confidentiality clause (Section 11) of our&nbsp;Terms of Service.</p> Data Retention + Deletion / Destruction <p>Alchemer retains data that we process on behalf of our Customers and data we collect from our Customers directly for as long as it is needed to provide services to our Customers.\nAlchemer will retain and use this data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>\n<p>Sometimes users have specific needs under institutional or state requirement.\nFor instance, occasionally data needs to be completely destroyed after its intended use.\nIn many cases (e.g.\nwhen a customer stops paying for an account, downgrades to a different account plan, etc.), data is retired and locked away rather than actually destroyed.\nIn most cases this makes the loss retrievable in the event of a mistake.\nWe can, however, comply with a request for total data destruction.\nyou just need to let us know.\nSee&nbsp;our section below&nbsp;(Section 4) for more information on data destruction.</p> Links to Other Sites <p>Our site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Alchemer.\nPlease be aware that we, Alchemer, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.\nWe encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p> Who we share or disclose information to <p>Due to recent European court rulings which have invalidated the&nbsp;EU-U.S.\nand Swiss-U.S.&nbsp;Privacy Shield Frameworks, Alchemer has elected to&nbsp;end&nbsp;our participation&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Privacy Shield&nbsp;Framework.\nPlease see our&nbsp;blog post detailing the&nbsp;(non)-impact to Alchemer customers.&nbsp;To that end,&nbsp;in the event that we need to share or disclose information, we still&nbsp;maintain accountability for your data in accordance with the onward transfer principles of the Privacy Shield Framework.&nbsp;We do not share information with any third parties except under the following very limited circumstances with the following protections:</p>\n<p>1.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Respondent Information with Customer:&nbsp;Our business is providing tools that allow you, our Customer, to conduct two-way communications with others.\nAccordingly, we provide you with access to the Respondent Information given in answer to the surveys you have conducted.\nYou may use the Respondent Information consistent with our&nbsp;Terms of Service, your own privacy policy, and applicable law.</p>\n<p>2.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;As Customers and Respondents Choose:&nbsp;We may share or otherwise use your Customer Information as you choose, and we may share Respondent Information as both you and the Survey Respondent choose.\nFor example, if you choose to have an email action send a copy of the survey response to the survey creator, survey respondent, and/or a third party.</p>\n<p>3.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Agents Acting on Our Behalf:&nbsp;We may share some of your Information with other companies who provide us with technical and other type of services such as a credit card processor or data hosting center.\nThey are contractually bound under nondisclosure agreements and are granted access to only Information that is necessary for their jobs, and are prohibited from using Information for any other purpose (including marketing or sharing the Information with any other party).\nWe do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties who are not services providers who have signed confidentiality agreements to perform services for us.</p>\n<p>4.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;For Legal Reasons:&nbsp;We are required by law to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.\nWe may also share your Information to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>\n<p>5.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Affiliates and Acquisition:&nbsp;We may share Information with our affiliated companies, products, and services (e.g., PeopleGizmo, HelpGizmo, etc.) or during any real or potential acquisition or merger of our company by or with another.\nWe will notify you if your Information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p> Data archiving / Deletion <p>Ceasing to pay for your account will archive your data.\nYou can re-access your data to be deleted by yourself or your users by paying for a monthly subscription that will allow you access the data for use (e.g.\nlocal storage on your computer, etc.) before deletion.\nAlternatively, if you do not require access before deletion, you can contact us directly in writing as stated above.</p>\n<p>Once a Survey Respondent has submitted a survey, the Survey Respondent may not be able to access his/her Information through the Site.\nWe do have&nbsp;software features available&nbsp;to allow Survey Respondents to re-access survey responses, but that must be enabled by the Survey Creator.\nSurvey Respondents may contact you and you, in turn, will be able to view the Survey Respondent\u2019s collected Information and, where appropriate, work with us in modifying such Information.</p> Data security <p>We have extensive security measures in place to protect your Information, and we are committed to the protection of your data.\nUnique user names and passwords must be entered each time a person logs on.\nWe work with a third-party Tier 1 data center service provider, AWS, to host our Site, Services, and Software in a secure production environment that uses a firewall and other technology to reasonably prevent access from outside intruders.\nWhen transmitting sensitive Information, we also have encryption technology available for your use.\n(See&nbsp;Project Data Encryption&nbsp;and&nbsp;Secure Links&nbsp;for more info.)</p>\n<p>All of our technology and processes are not, however, guarantees of security (see our Terms of Service for more information).\nYou should also bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site whilst it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.</p>\n<p>For more information on our security measures, get in touch with us at&nbsp;support@alchemer.com&nbsp;and at (800) 609-6480, or head to some of our other site
