intellectual property owner or their agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the Splice Properties, and (ii) remove any User Content posted to the Splice Properties by \u201crepeat infringers.\u201d We consider a \u201crepeat infringer\u201d to be any User that has uploaded User Content to the Splice Properties and for whom we have received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512(c) with respect to such User Content.\nWe have discretion, however, to terminate the account of any User after receipt of a single notification of claimed infringement or upon our own determination.\n</p>\n<p> The DMCA provides recourse for intellectual property owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.\nlaw.\nIf you believe in good faith that materials posted on the Splice Properties infringe your intellectual property rights, then you (or your agent) may send us a \u201cNotification of Claimed Infringement\u201d requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.\nThe notice must include the following information: </p>\n<ol>\n<li> A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed.\n</li>\n<li> Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to
