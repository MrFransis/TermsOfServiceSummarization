is a Klarna payment method by referring to the general terms and conditions regarding payments methods.\nInformation collected will generally only be used for the purposes of payment settlement and in this regard, to fulfil a contractual obligation with us.\nThe individual processing steps are described below.</p>\nHow do we use your information?\n<p>Payment settlement, payment reminders and debt collection</p>\n<p>As the holder of the payment claim of your contractual obligation with the seller (e.g.\npurchase), we are equally entitled to collect information about you which is required to enforce this payment obligation.\nThis also includes the processing of information for the purpose of payment reminders and debt collections.\nFor this purpose, your information may also be shared

fulfil the contractual payment obligation.</p>\n<p>As part of this identity and credit investigation, the seller will share your information (last name, first name, title, street, house number, postcode, city, date of birth, email address, telephone number and, for purchases paid by direct debit, the bank account submitted, and any other personal details) as well as information connected

information agencies is also to meet statutory obligations to carry out investigations of the creditworthiness of customers (sections 505a and 506 of the German Civil Code (B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch).</p>\n<p>The information agencies process the information received for the purpose of profiling (scoring) so that they can give information regarding inter alia the credit assessments of

BP Den Haag </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Regarding Switzerland, an EU adequacy decision pursuant to Art.\n45 para.\n3 GDPR has been adopted.\nConsequently, the level of data protection available in Switzerland is also adequate.</p>\n<p>BillPay is part of Klarna Group.\nTherefore, other Group companies, in particular Klarna Bank AB (publ), Sveav\u00e4gen 46, 113 43 Stockholm, Sweden (\u201cKlarna\u201d), may also be included in the credit investigation described above.\nAs a result, the findings of a credit investigation may be shared to a limited extent with Klarna in order to improve the findings and processed by Klarna for its own future credit investigations.\nConversely, the credit investigation and any decisions made on the basis of its result may, in some cases, be undertaken entirely by Klarna for the further performance of the contract.\nIn this case, the relevant positive and negative payment experiences will first be transferred to Klarna and then deleted after the transaction is completed.\nThe legal basis for sharing this information is the legitimate administrative interest of BillPay to compare and harmonise the decisions of the credit investigation with Group companies.</p>\n<p>The decision to permit you to use the payment methods of BillPay is an automated decision made on a case-by-case basis in accordance with Art.\n22 German General Data Protection Regulation (Datenschutz-Grundverordnung, DSGVO).\nThis automatic decision is required for BillPay to assume and enforce the payment claim against you.\nIf the score obtained for your creditworthiness is below a predefined limit, you will not be offered any BillPay payment methods.\nThis will not involve any human judgement or decision-making.\nYou have the right, if the use of BillPay payment methods is not permitted, to contact BillPay and to present your position and to argue for a change of decision.\nFor this purpose, please contact datenschutz@billpay.de.</p>\n<p>Fraud prevention</p>\n<p>For the purpose of preventing fraud, your information will also be analysed using certain parameters for patterns of improper or fraudulent conduct.\nExternal tools may be used for this purpose.\nIn this case, your information will be transmitted on the basis of an order processing agreement.\nInformation regarding conduct in breach of contract may also be shared with the aforementioned information agencies.\nLegal basis for processing is our legitimate interest in preventing fraud in the use of our services.</p>\n<p>BillPay has hired the services, as controller for fraud prevention through device fingerprinting, of ThreatMetrix Inc., 160 W.\nSanta Clara Street, Suite 1400, San Jose, 95113 California, USA.\nFor these purposes, your IP address is processed in the USA and linked to other non personal data to generate a device fingerprint which can be used to recognize your device when you use BillPay again.\nAn adequate level of protection is guaranteed through an agreement signed with ThreatMetrix Inc., which includes standard contractual clauses pursuant to Art.\n46 II c) and Art.\n93 II GDPR.</p>\n<p>General data analysis</p>\n<p>We analyse the customer information collected to improve our services and plan the prepared resources.\nThe legal basis for the processing of data in this regard is our legitimate interest in the further development and improvement of our services as well as in part the need to fulfil the contract.</p>\n<p>Communication with you</p>\n<p>We may also use the contact information you submit to contact you by telephone or email and to inform you about BillPay\u2019s services which you have previously selected or services similar to these.\nIf you do not wish to be contacted, you can inform us of this at any time and without incurring any separate costs by writing to service@billpay.de.</p>\n<p>Compliance with statutory obligations</p>\n<p>We also process your information if this is required to fulfil statutory obligations such as the storage of business documents or to fulfil a statutory obligation to share or otherwise disclose information.\nThe legal basis in this respect is the need to fulfil a legal obligation.</p>\n<p>Data processing in relation to the website</p>\n<p>Personal information is processed in our website if this is required for the comfortable and error-free functionality of the website and the use of its features such as the processing of an inquiry.\nThe scope of the data processing also depends on which features of the website you use.\nUnless otherwise stated below, the legal basis of the processing is our legitimate interest in the provision of the website and the respective features.</p>\n<p>When simply visiting our website, we save data about the connection (server log files).\nThis information will be sent to us by your browser.\nThis information is required for technical purposes to ensure the functionality of the website.\nThis may comprise the

used</li>\n<li>The operating system used</li>\n<li>Your IP address</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The data processing is based on our legitimate interest to provide the website and to ensure and improve its functionality.\nThe server log files continue to be saved after your visit ends in order to recognise and prevent any improper use.</p>\n<p>You can register for a customer account to manage your payments.\nTo register, the password to be defined by you must be transmitted.\nThis will only be used to process and settle your payment and to implement the features of your account.\nThe legal basis for this is that it is required in order to perform the contract.</p>\n<p>If you use the contact from on our website to send us an inquiry, we will collect the following information for this

to conclude a contract, the legal basis is the necessity for the pre-contractual obligation.</p>\n<p>If you would like to apply to us, you can do so centrally via the website of Klarna AB https://www.klarna.com/careers/locations/berlin/.\nFurther details of the applicable rules can be found in the applicable data protection statement of Klarna AB.</p>\n<p>To optimise the user

parent company Akamai Inc., 150 Broadway, Cambridge, 02142 MA, USA.\nFor this purpose, the web content requested from BillPay websites is routed over the Akamai server network.\nAs a general rule, servers in proximity to the site user\u2019s place of retrieval are used.\nBy way of exception (for instance, in the event of attack, where site users are found outside the EU or should congestion be experienced within the EU), content can be directed over servers outside the EU, in particular servers in the United States.\nDuring utilisation of the CDN, both your IP address and data regarding your Internet use will, for technical reasons, be processed and analysed for fraud prevention purposes by Akamai.\nBoth Akamai Technologies AB and Akamai Inc.\nfully comply with data protection requirements in all contract implementation.\nWe have entered into agreements with both Akamai Technologies AB and Akamai Inc.\nincluding standard contractual clauses pursuant to Art 46 II c) and
