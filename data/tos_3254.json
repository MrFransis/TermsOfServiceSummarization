Marques\nGunter SalsaIndy LLC, 815-A Brazos Street #365 Austin, TX 78701.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are a copyright owner (or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner) and have a good faith belief that your work\u2019s copyright has been\ninfringed, please report your notice of infringement to use by providing our Designated Agent with a written notification of claimed infringement that\nincludes substantially the following: (i) your contact information, including your name, address, telephone number, and email address.\n(ii) identification\nand description of each copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed.\n(iii) the exact URL or location of the material that you claim is infringing.\n(iv) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use

statement by you, made under\npenalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the\ncopyright owners.\n</p>\n<p>\nPlease note that Section 512(f) of the DMCA may impose liability for damages on any person who knowingly sends meritless notices of infringement.\nPlease do\nnot make false claims.\n</p>\n<p>\nUpon receipt of a bona fide infringement notification by the Designated Agent, it is our policy to expeditiously remove or disable access to the infringing\nmaterial, notify the registered user of its violation of the DMCA and these Terms and, for repeat offenders, we may also terminate such registered user\u2019s\naccess to the Website.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn particular, upon receipt of a notice complying or substantially complying with the DMCA, MyVidster may send the registered user, who initially linked to\nthe allegedly infringing material and first introduced it to the MyVidster website (the \u201cOriginal Linker\u201d), a notice that it has violated these Terms and\nConditions and the DMCA.\nUpon receiving a third notice from the same copyright owner that a particular registered user \u2013 who is an Original Linker and has\nalready received two violation notices \u2013 has linked to an allegedly infringing video, MyVidster may consider that user to be a repeat infringer, and may\ndisable that user\u2019s account.\nUpon termination of that account, MyVidster may disclose to the copyright owner the following personal information relating to\nthat user, to the extent MyVidster possesses such information: first and last name, login history (which includes date, time and IP address at time of\nlogin), email address, internet protocol (IP) address,

information.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf we remove or disable access to content in response to an infringement notice, we will make reasonable attempts to contact the owner or administrator of\nthe affected content.\nIf your material has been removed and you believe that your material does not constitute infringement, you may provide MyVidster with\na counter notification by written communication to the attention of \"DMCA Counter Notification Dept.\" at copyright@myvidster.com that sets forth all of the\nnecessary information required by the DMCA (http://www.copyright.gov/title17/ 92chap5.html#512).\nPlease note that you may be liable for damages (including\ncosts and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material does not constitute copyright infringement.\nIf you are uncertain whether an\nactivity constitutes infringement, we recommended seeking advice of an attorney.\n</p>\n<p>\n12.\nAPPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE TOOL\n</p>\n<p>\nWe provide webmasters with access to a back-end application program interface (API) tool that allows webmasters to see the source of allegedly infringing\ncontent and directly remove links to infringing content appearing on the Website, including the entire post, page and/or comments associated with that\nlink.\nprovided that the webmaster has first authenticated itself to MyVidster, requested access to the API tool and been granted access by MyVidster.\n</p>\n<p>\n13.\nTERMINATION\n</p>\n<p>\nWe reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate or restrict access or discontinue service to
