successors, and assignees, and you agree that any Dispute (as defined herein) between you and TOLO regarding any aspect of your relationship with TOLO, will be resolved in a binding, confidential, individual and fair arbitration process, and not in court.&nbsp.\nEach of you and TOLO agrees to give up the right to sue in court.\nThe term \u201cDispute\u201d is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any dispute, claim, demand, count, cause of action, or controversy between you and TOLO, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory.&nbsp.\nThe term

arbitrator.&nbsp.\nEach of you and TOLO also agrees to give up the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and TOLO (see paragraph 9 below).\nCourt review of the arbitration award shall only be in accordance with the applicable law.&nbsp.\nThe appointed arbitrator(s) must be bound by the terms of this arbitration agreement.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages).</p>\n<p>(2) All domestic disputes between TOLO and any other Afghan national (\u201cDomestic Disputes\u201d) shall be finally resolved through domestic arbitration, and all disputes of international nature between TOLO and any other non-Afghan (\u201cInternational Disputes\u201d) shall be resolved through international arbitration as outlined below.\nRegardless whether the dispute is a domestic or international, the substantive law shall be the laws of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Domestic Arbitration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any domestic arbitration between you and TOLO shall be conducted by the Afghan Center for Dispute Resolution (\u201cACDR\u201d) pursuant to the Afghan Law of Commercial Arbitration (the \u201cDomestic Rules\u201d).\nThe venue of arbitration shall be Kabul, Afghanistan.\nThe Arbitration

sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the website or portion of the website to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested.&nbsp.\nYour Notice to TOLO must be sent by mail to TOLO\u2019s head office at Street #12, Wazir Akbar Khan, Kabul, Afghanistan.\nTOLO will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide.\nIt is the sender\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice.&nbsp.\nDuring the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you and we do not resolve the Dispute within 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the provisions of these Terms of Use.\nIn addition to filing this Demand for Arbitration, you must send a copy of this completed Demand for Arbitration to TOLO at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(4) You and TOLO acknowledge and agree to abide by the following rules for arbitration: (a) YOU AND TOLO MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR MULTI-CLAIMANT PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO POWER TO AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF.\n(b) the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are permitted by applicable law.\nand (c) each side pays his, her or its own attorneys' fees, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 below.</p>\n<p>(5) Filing fees or other charges shall be payable in line with the procedural rules of this arbitration agreement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(6) Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, each of you and TOLO shall cooperate in good faith in the exchange of non-privileged documents and information as necessary in accordance with the procedural rules of this arbitration agreement, and the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p>(7) Each of you and TOLO may incur attorneys\u2019 fees during the arbitration.\nEach side agrees to pay his, her or its own attorneys' fees unless the claim(s) at issue permit the prevailing party to be paid its attorneys' fees, and in such instance, the fees awarded shall be determined by the applicable law(s).\nIn addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a claim or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides\u2019 arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by applicable law.</p>\n<p>(8) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator may not order TOLO to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless TOLO explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order Further, unless TOLO expressly agrees, the arbitrator may not consolidate other persons\u2019 claims with yours, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, multi-claimant or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>(9) You and TOLO agree to maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and shall not disclose the fact of the arbitration, any documents exchanged as part of any mediation,&nbsp.\nproceedings of the arbitration, the arbitrator\u2019s decision and the existence or amount of any award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration (in which case anyone becoming privy to confidential information must undertake to preserve its confidentiality), or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a provisional remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or court order.</p>\n<p>(10) Except for subpart (a) in paragraph (4) (i.e., the waiver of the ability to proceed on behalf of multiple claimants or a purported class), if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, or illegal provision were not contained.\nIf, however, subpart (a) in paragraph (4) is found invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, but the rest of these Terms, including the provisions governing where actions against TOLO must be pursued, the choice of governing law, will remain in effect and apply to any claim that, for this or any other reason, proceeds in court rather than in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Indemnity</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold TOLO and its affiliates, and their respective successors and assignees, directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, licensors, suppliers and service providers harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), arising in any way out of or in connection with (a) your use of this website, (b) your breach or violation of these Terms of Use.\nor (c) your violation of any rights of another.\nMOBBY

Afghanistan, without regard to its conflict of law provision.\nExcept with respect to Disputes to be resolved through an arbitration process in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement contained above, you and TOLO agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Kabul, Afghanistan to resolve any Dispute arising out of these Terms or this website.\nYOU HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO A RECOMMENDED ARBITRATION BY THE HUQOQ IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS,

provided herein, if any provision of these Terms of Use is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\nThe failure of TOLO to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.</p>\n<p>The Section titles
