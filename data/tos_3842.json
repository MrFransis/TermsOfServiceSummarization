and its Services <p>Paxful is a leading peer-to-peer marketplace to facilitate the purchase and sale of Digital Assets with sellers accepting more than 300 payment methods in exchange for their Digital Assets.\nPayment methods are negotiated and exchanged on a peer-to-peer basis between the buyers in the Marketplace (\u201c<strong>Buyers</strong>\u201d) and sellers in the Marketplace (\u201c<strong>Sellers</strong>\u201d).\nOur users agree upon which payment methods to use to complete a transaction and are fully responsible and liable for using such payment methods in a lawful manner.</p>\n<p>Paxful also offers hosted digital wallet services through a leading global digital asset wallet provider.\nOur worldwide userbase is able to post offers to either buy or sell Digital Assets in a variety of convenient methods.\nThe creator of the offer is responsible for listing terms of the transaction, including the payment methods the Seller will accept.\nOnce an offer is selected by another Paxful user, the Seller\u2019s Digital Assets are locked as part of our transaction procedures (which we refer to as \u201cPaxful Escrow\u201d) until all conditions necessary to consummate the transaction have occurred.\nThe sale is complete and Digital Assets are unlocked and released to the Buyer by the Seller once the Buyer has completed the terms of the transaction and payment has been confirmed valid and received by the Seller.\nPAXFUL DOES NOT ACT AS A PAYMENT PROCESSOR.\nALL LIABILITY FOR SENDING AND RECEIVING PAYMENT AND CONFIRMING THE VALIDITY OF THE TRANSACTIONS LIE BETWEEN THE BUYER AND SELLER.\nThe Digital Assets we lock are released back to the Seller if the Buyer chooses to cancel the transaction.\nThe Seller may not cancel the transaction at any point.\nThe Seller only has the option to unlock the Digital Assets and release it to the Buyer.\nThis is for the security protection for the Buyer.\nShould a Seller need to cancel the transaction due to a Buyer not following the terms of the transaction, they must start a dispute and provide a reason for doing so as further described in Section 8 of this Agreement.\nTransactions on our Website

telephone and the arbitrator may provide for submitting and determining motions on briefs, without oral hearings.\nThe prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be

and Sellers to communicate, work together to figure out what happened, and come to an agreeable solution.\nWhen a Buyer and a Seller cannot come to an agreeable solution, Paxful\u2019s support team (\u201c<strong>Paxful Support</strong>\u201d) can help.\nEither party can initiate the dispute resolution process (\u201c<strong>disputed transaction</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>dispute</strong>\u201d) with respect to a transaction.\nDisputes can only be initiated on transactions that are marked as fully paid by the Buyer.\nTransactions that are not marked as fully paid by the Buyer, cancelled by the Buyer, automatically cancelled due to expiration of the timeframe set forth in the offer, already disputed and resolved or where the Seller has released the Digital Assets to the Buyer generally cannot be disputed, reversed, or altered.</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Dispute Resolution Process.</u> Below are the steps Paxful Support takes in the event of a dispute.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Initiation</em>\n</p>\n<p>You can initiate a dispute by logging into your Paxful Account, opening the transaction you would like to dispute and selecting the \u201cdispute\u201d button.\nThe \u201cdispute\u201d button will only appear active if the transaction has been marked as fully paid by the Buyer.\nOnce you initiate a dispute, you will select the type of dispute from the options presented and describe the issue giving rise to your dispute.</p>\n<p>The options presented for describing your dispute if you are a Seller are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coinlocker (i.e.\nan unresponsive Buyer) \u2013 the Buyer has marked the transaction as fully paid, but is unresponsive and inactive.</li>\n<li>Payment issue \u2013 the Buyer is active and has attempted to pay, but there are issues with the payment.</li>\n<li>Other \u2013 an open option where you can describe what issue gave rise to the dispute.\nThe Buyer will be able to view your description.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The options presented for describing your dispute if you are a Buyer are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unresponsive vendor \u2013 you have paid, but the Seller is unresponsive and inactive.</li>\n<li>Payment issue \u2013 you have made the payment, but the Seller claims there are issues with the payment and refuses to release the Digital Assets.</li>\n<li>Other \u2013 an open option where you can describe what issue gave rise to the dispute.\nThe Seller will be able to view your description.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Notification</em>\n</p>\n<p>Once a dispute has been submitted, Paxful Support will provide the other party with notification by email and by sending a message through the transaction chat feature available to Buyers and Sellers in the Marketplace alerting such party that a dispute has been initiated.\nIf one of your transactions is being disputed, Paxful Support will tell you which transaction is being disputed and why the transaction is being disputed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Response</em>\n</p>\n<p>Review the dispute and provide Paxful Support with an explanation of what happened.\nInclude any evidence you have to support your explanation, such as proof of payment, proof of ownership or proof that you have or have not received payment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Paxful Review</em>\n</p>\n<p>Disputed transactions will be investigated by Paxful Support and a decision will be made based upon evidence provided by both parties.\nPaxful Support resolves disputes by evaluating various factors as described below in Section 8.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Dispute Review</u>.\nDuring a dispute review, Paxful Support may give you instructions that you are required to follow.\nThe instructions given to you may require you to provide additional evidence, such as additional ID verification, proof of payment, any photo, audio, or video evidence, or any other documents deemed relevant by Paxful and may require you to provide such evidence within a specified timeframe.\nFailure to follow the instructions may lead to the dispute being resolved against you.\nPaxful Support will typically provide notice of its decision via the transaction chat feature in the Marketplace within 30 days of receiving the dispute, but under some circumstances, it may take longer.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Unresponsiveness</u>.\nWhen you are involved in a transaction, it is important that you remain active and available from the time the transaction is started to the time that the transaction is completed, canceled, or resolved.\nThis means that you must be able to provide a response to a request by Paxful Support in a disputed transaction within the time specified by Paxful Support or you may be deemed as unresponsive and the dispute may be resolved against you.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Chargebacks</u>.\nA party may face additional risks depending on the payment method used for the transaction even if Paxful\u2019s dispute resolution process finds in favor of such party.\nThe dispute resolution process set forth in this Agreement is separate from any remedies a Buyer or Seller may have through the payment method used in connection with a transaction.\nPaxful is not obligated to initiate or handle chargebacks and is not liable if a party reverses, charges back, or otherwise disputes a transaction via an avenue made available to the party through the payment method used in the transaction, including after a dispute is closed.</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Dispute Resolution</u>.\nA disputed transaction is most commonly resolved by Paxful Support moving the Digital Assets subject to the dispute to the Buyer or the Seller of the disputed transaction once the dispute resolution process is complete.</p>\n<p>Below are selected situations to provide you with insight as to how Paxful may resolve a disputed transaction.\nThis is not meant to be an exhaustive list.\nThe resolution of any dispute will be impacted by the specific facts of the dispute and evidence provided by the users.</p>\n<p>Paxful Support may resolve a dispute in the Buyer\u2019s favor when at least one of the following criteria are met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Buyer has made payment according to the initial instructions provided by the Seller pursuant to the transaction offer and the Buyer has provided sufficient proof that the payment was made according to these instructions.\nIt is a violation of this Agreement for a Seller to refuse to complete a transaction once the Buyer has satisfied all of the Seller\u2019s terms and conditions as posted at the time the Buyer accepted and paid for the transaction.</li>\n<li>The Seller has become unresponsive and has not provided a sufficient response within the timeframe requested by Paxful Support.</li>\n<li>The payment is made to a third party to the transaction or the payment is made to a payment account not registered in the name of the Seller.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Paxful Support may resolve a dispute in the Seller\u2019s favor when one of the following criteria are met:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Buyer has not provided payment, not provided payment in full or not provided payment according to the initial instructions provided by the Seller pursuant to the transaction offer.</li>\n<li>The payment made by the Buyer has been held, suspended, frozen or stopped by the payment provider or processor.\nThis includes situations in which the Buyer has charged back or disputed a payment via its bank or payment card issuer.</li>\n<li>The Buyer has become unresponsive and has not provided a sufficient response within the timeframe requested Paxful Support.</li>\n<li>The payment is made by a third party to the transaction or the payment is made from a payment account not registered in the name of the Buyer.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the Buyer or the Seller of a disputed transaction provides fraudulent information or fraudulent documents or makes false claims or otherwise uses deceptive tactics, the dispute may be immediately resolved against such user and such user\u2019s account may be immediately suspended or terminated at the sole discretion of Paxful Support.</p>\n<p>In some situations where neither party fulfills the criteria, or it is in other ways unclear or not possible to determine which party has fulfilled the dispute resolution criteria in Paxful\u2019s sole and absolute discretion, Paxful may decide to resolve the dispute by splitting the Digital Assets subject to the dispute between the Buyer and the Seller evenly or unevenly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Appeal</u>.\nIf you believe Paxful has resolved a dispute in a way which is not in accordance with this Agreement, you have a right to request an appeal.\nTo request an appeal, you need to promptly notify us in writing by contacting Paxful customer support no later than 10 calendar days after notice of Paxful Support\u2019s decision is delivered to you and provide us with sufficient details and evidence supporting your case for request.\nYour appeal should specifically identify how you believe Paxful incorrectly resolved the dispute as per the terms of this Agreement and provide evidence of such incorrect decision.</p>\n<p>Please be reminded that whether during the dispute process or generally any time when using our Services, you are obligated to keep a civil tone and be respectful to other users and Paxful Support.\nSee generally, \u201cSection 13 - Prohibited Use\u201d.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Finality</u>.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Paxful\u2019s decision regarding a dispute is conclusive, final and binding as described in this Agreement.\nPaxful will have no liability to either a Buyer or a Seller in connection with its decisions.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> FEES FOR USING PAXFUL SERVICES <ol>\n<li>Creating a Wallet is free.\nPaxful charges fees for Services, applicable fees will be displayed prior
