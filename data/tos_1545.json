<ul>\n<li>FAQ</li>\n<li>Pricing</li>\n<li>Contact</li>\n<li>Log In</li>\n</ul> DiscourseHosting Terms of Service Usage\n<p>We provide you with a hosted Discourse forum and allow you a certain amount of data transfer and storage, depending on your plan.\nIn most cases, if you use our services consistently with our terms of Service, visitors to your web site will be able to download and view as much content from your site as they like.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, our server processing power, server memory, or abuse controls could limit downloads from your site.\nYou will always be able to use as much data transfer as your account has.\nYou are allocated a monthly data transfer allowance.\nThis allowance varies depending on the hosting package you purchase.\nShould your account pass the allocated amount we reserve the right to suspend the account until the start of the next allocation, suspend the account until more data transfer is purchased at an additional fee, suspend the account until you upgrade to a higher level of package, terminate the account and/or charge you an additional fee for the overages.\nNote that we will always contact you first and discuss your options.\nUnused transfer in one month cannot be carried over to the next month.</p>\nPayment and Renewal\n<p>By selecting a subscription plan you agree to pay DiscourseHosting the monthly or annual subscription fees for the service and additional usage fees indicated for that subscription plan.\nPayments will be charged on the subscription start date and will cover the use of the service for a monthly or annual period as indicated.\nSubscription fees are not refundable and are paid in advance of using such services.\nPayment for Services will be made by a valid credit card accepted by DiscourseHosting, unless other payment arrangements have been made.\nUpon forum creation you authorize DiscourseHosting to charge your credit card for such amounts according to your service usage.\nDiscourseHosting reserves the right to change the payment terms and fees upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to you.\nUnless otherwise stated in your subscription agreement, the subscription can be canceled by you at anytime.\nNo refunds are provided for unused service portion of the billing period following cancellation.</p>\n<p>Unless you notify DiscourseHosting before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel your subscription, your subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for the service (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you.\nThe subscription can be canceled at any time in the Payments section of your site\u2019s dashboard.</p>\nAvailability and integrity\n<p>Your use of this service is at your sole risk.\nOur backup service runs once a day, and one week of backups are kept.</p>\n<p>We offer an uptime guarantee of 99.9%.\nAny downtime over 0.1% will be refunded with a prorated fee based on actual downtime per month.\nOur network and servers are monitored continuously, and are rarely down except for scheduled maintenance and hardware and software upgrades.</p>\nLimitation of Liability and Indemnification\n<p>DiscourseHosting shall not be responsible for any claimed damages, including incidental and consequential damages, which may arise from DiscourseHosting\u2019 servers going off-line or being unavailable for any reason

DiscourseHosting.\n(2) any material supplied by customer infringing or allegedly infringing on the proprietary rights of a third party.\n(3) copyright infringement and (4) any defective products sold to customers from DiscourseHosting\u2019s server.</p>\nRestrictions in Usage of our Service\n<p>We provide you with a hosted Discourse forum.\nOur service may not be used as a means to carry out other activities that don\u2019t have anything to do with forum hosting.\nIt may for instance not be used as a cheap file hosting service, or use it to spread other content like viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content.\nUsing our service to undermine or cause harm to a server or customer of DiscourseHosting is also strictly prohibited.</p>\n<p>If you create an account on DiscourseHosting, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and forum, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other
