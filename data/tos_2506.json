PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and SmartNews otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will be deemed void.\nExcept as provided in the preceding sentence, this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration Rules</b>\n</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<b>\u201cAAA\u201d</b>) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the <b>\u201cAAA Rules\u201d</b>) then in effect, except as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section.\n(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration Process</b>\n</p>\nA party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration Location and Procedure</b>\n</p>\n<p>Unless you and SmartNews otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and SmartNews submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitrator\u2019s Decision</b>\n</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.\nSmartNews will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Fees</b>\n</p>\n<p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, SmartNews will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Changes</b>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the \u201cChanges to Terms or Services\u201d section above, if SmartNews changes this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to info@smartnews.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date above.\nBy rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and SmartNews in accordance with the provisions of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p> General Terms\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between SmartNews and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between SmartNews and you regarding the Services and Content.\nIf for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without SmartNews\u2019s prior written consent.\nAny attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null.\nSmartNews may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.\nSubject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>\n<p>Any notices or other communications provided by SmartNews under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by posting to the Services.\n</p>\n<p>SmartNews\u2019s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.\nThe waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of SmartNews.\nExcept as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p> Contact
