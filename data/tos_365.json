notification by a copyright owner or a person Authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon CaringBridge actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Right to Modify or Discontinue Service and Sites <p>CaringBridge reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service, the Site or Individual Sites (or any part thereof) with or without notice.\nCaringBridge shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service or Individual Sites.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Special Terms for Special

as a \"click-through\" agreement.\nIf any of the terms of the click-through agreement are different than the terms of these Terms of Use, the terms of the click-through agreement shall supplement or amend these Terms of Use, but only with respect to the matters governed by the click-through agreement.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Linked Sites and Social Media <p>The Service and Sites may provide links to other websites or resources that are neither controlled nor endorsed by CaringBridge.\nThe Site may also include widgets or buttons that allow you to share, post, retweet or otherwise use content from the

Features.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Fundraising <p>As a charitable 501(c)(3) organization, CaringBridge may invite users to provide charitable donations to CaringBridge.\nDonations ensure families can use CaringBridge free of charge.\nCaringBridge will inform users of the opportunity to donate through the Service, within email communications and within direct mail letters.\nUsers can opt-out of email and direct mail letter communications.</p>\n<p>From time to time, users will post information on an Individual Site to let other users know how they can contribute money to help someone in need.\nOur concern is that some of these requests for help may be fraudulent, and our users may be deceived.\nWe cannot review every posting on every Individual Site and have no way of policing these requests or determining their authenticity.\nAccordingly, we urge you not to respond to any such fundraising requests that may be posted on an Individual Site unless you are absolutely certain, from firsthand knowledge, that the request is legitimate and that your donation will be used in the manner you intend.\nCaringBridge will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any losses or damages caused or alleged to be caused in connection with your response to any solicitation contained on any individual site.\nWe also want to remind you that contributions made in response to such

usefulness of any content appearing on this service.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Limitations of Liability <p>Under no circumstances, shall CaringBridge, or its sponsors, licensors, or service providers, or any of its or their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees or agents (collectively, the \u201creleased parties\u201d), be liable to you or any third party claiming through you for any losses or damages arising out of or in connection with this service, its content (including user submissions), any products or services made available through this service, or your use of or inability to use this service, including any loss or damage due to viruses that may affect your computer equipment, software, data or other property on account of your use of this service or your downloading of any material from this service.</p>\n<p>This is a comprehensive limitation of liability that applies to all losses and damages of any kind (whether direct, indirect, general, special, consequential, incidental, exemplary or otherwise, including, without limitation, loss of data, income, or profits), whether the claim is based on contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or any other legal theory, even if an authorized representative of CaringBridge or another released party has been advised of or should have known of the possibility of such damages, and without regard to the success or effectiveness of other remedies.</p>\n<p>If any part of this limitation of liability is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, then the aggregate liability of

entity claiming through you for liabilities that otherwise would have been limited shall not exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00).\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of liability for certain types of damages.\nAccordingly, some of these limitations of liability may not apply to you.\nNothing in these terms and conditions shall limit or exclude liability for losses or damages which may not be lawfully excluded or limited by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Choice of Law, Jurisdiction and Venue <p>These Terms of Use and the relationship between you and CaringBridge shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the federal laws of the United States of America and the internal laws of the State of Minnesota, U.S.A., excluding conflict of law\u2019s provisions that would indicate the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.\nAny legal action or proceeding relating to your access to, or use of, this service or these terms of use shall be instituted only in a state or federal court located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, USA.\nYou and CaringBridge irrevocably agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.\nYou expressly waive any claim of improper venue and any claim that such courts are an inconvenient forum.\nIf the courts of the country in which you reside should determine that the provisions of this paragraph are not enforceable, then you agree to submit to binding arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Statute of Limitations <p>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our Service or these Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>\n<p>\n</p> General Term Disclosures <p>As used in these Terms of Use, the term \"including\" means \"including, but not limited to.\" Section headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.</p>\n<p>Our failure at any time to require performance of any provision of these Terms of Use or to exercise any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision or such right.\nIf any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.\nThe remaining provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>These Terms of Use set forth the entire understanding and agreement between us and supersede all prior understandings and agreements between you and CaringBridge with respect to the subject matter hereof.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Changes to Terms of

maintaining a personal, individual page or website on behalf of yourself or another person (\u201cIndividual Site\u201d) or visiting and posting to an Individual Site created by someone else.\nBy their very nature, these Individual Sites contain a great deal of personal information about the subject of the Individual Site and other individuals.\nFor this reason, we allow the creator of an Individual Site to control the level of privacy they apply to their Individual Site.\nOur goal is to balance our users' need to find each other and communicate information and support against our users' desire for a measure of privacy.</p> Privacy Settings and Site Access <p>You may increase the privacy of the Individual Site by making it accessible \u201cBy Invitation Only.\u201d This privacy setting can be changed at any time during the lifetime of the Individual Site by going to \u201cSite Settings.\u201d</p> Discoverability: How People Find Your Site <p>CaringBridge also offers a public search listing feature that allows you to publish portions of your Individual Site to the public Internet.\nThe publicly visible information may include: (1) the first and last name and the subject of the Individual Site.\n(2) the title of the Individual Site.\n(3) the profile picture of the Individual Site.\n(3) the date and time of the first journal post to the Individual Site.\nand (4) the date and time of the most recent journal post to the Individual Site.\nThis public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name.\nYou have the option to activate the public profile feature when you initially create an Individual Site or at any time during the lifetime of the Individual Site by going to \u201cSite Settings.\u201d</p>\n<p>Every member of a caring community, including the creators of Individual Sites and all users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the website address of an Individual Site in accordance with the subject's wishes.</p>\n<p>\n</p> What Information is Collected by CaringBridge? <p>The lawful basis for collection of the information described in this section is your consent, as necessary to fulfil a contract with you, our legal obligations, and our legitimate business interests.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Information You Volunteer.</em> CaringBridge collects the personal information you and others knowingly and voluntarily provide when you use our Service on our Site or through our mobile application, for example, the personal information you provide when you create or post content on an Individual Site, complete a survey, make a donation, use our \"tell a friend\" feature, or contact our customer care personnel.\n\"Personal information\" means information about an identified or identifiable individual.\nExamples of personal information include your name, your email address and email username, social media sign-in information, address, credit card information and your photograph.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Google User Information.</em> If you choose to register for or sign into the Site using Google, CaringBridge will access, collect, and store certain personal information associated with your Google User Account, including your first name, last name, email address, and profile picture.\nUpon request, CaringBridge will also access, collect, and store your contacts.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Credit Card Information.</em> If you provide credit card information through the Service, the information you provide is never stored on our server.\nInstead, when you click on the \"submit\" button, it is forwarded immediately to a third-party service provider for processing.\nWe use industry standard Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) software to encrypt all of your credit card information as it travels over the Internet and via wireless methods to our third-party service provider.\nWe do not retain a copy of your credit card information.\nOur third-party services providers use your credit card information only to process your transaction (and for fraud prevention purposes) and are bound by contract to keep your credit card information confidential.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Information Collected From Your Mobile Device.</em> When using our mobile application, we will collect your device type and the operating system you are using to create aggregate statistics in order to improve our mobile application.</p>\n<p>We do not ask you for access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile application or services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser.</em> We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser and through our mobile application.\nThis information typically includes your IP address, the identity of your Internet service provider, the name and version of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit.\nPlease check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.\nGenerally, we do not link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you by name.</p>\n<p>\n<em>More About IP Addresses.</em> An \"IP address\" is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you connect to the Internet.\nIt is used to identify your computer's \"location\" in cyberspace, so that the information you request can be delivered to you.\nIf you use a dialup connection or a connection that assigns dynamic IP addresses, your computer will be assigned a new IP address each time you connect to the Internet.\nIf, however, your computer is permanently connected to the Internet using a static IP address, the IP address assigned to your computer will generally be the same each time you use your computer.</p>\n<p>IP addresses do not include your name, email address or other information that identifies you personally, but in some cases, they can be used to identify you.\nFor example, we may link your IP address to account information that identifies you personally.\nWe may also provide your IP address to our third-party service provider who can use it to identify your state and zip code.\nThis gives us valuable demographic information about the individuals who use the Service.\nThe third-party service provider is bound by contract to use the IP addresses we provide only for this purpose.\nIn addition, if, for example, we suspect fraud or a threat to the security of the Service, we may share our server logs - which contain IP addresses - with the appropriate investigative authorities, who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.</p>\n<p>\n</p> How CaringBridge Uses Cookies and Similar Technologies <p>We use \"cookies\" and other web technologies to collect information and support certain features of the Service on our Site.\nFor example, we may use these technologies to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collect information about the ways people use the Service - which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page;</li>\n<li>Estimate the number of visitors using the Service;</li>\n<li>Recognize when you return to use the Service;</li>\n<li>Support the features and functionality of the Service - for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits.\nand</li>\n<li>Personalize your experience when

Cookies: Third Party cookies are installed for the user by third parties that track usage and activity information to improve the user experience and provide site usage information for us.</p>\n<p>Our third-party tracking-utility and ad network partner uses a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.\nWeb Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content by informing us what content is effective on our Site or on Individual Sites.\nClear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.\nIn contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on certain pages on the Site and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.\nWe do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>The information we collect using these web technologies does not identify you personally.\nIf, however, you have created a user identity, for example by registering, we may link the information we collect using these web technologies to other information that identifies you personally.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.\nYou may also deactivate our cookies as soon as you leave the Service.\nAlthough you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit the Service, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of the Service.</p>\n<p>The use of cookies by our partners, tracking utility company, and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement.\nIn some instances, we have access or control over these cookies.\nOur partners, tracking utility company, and service providers use session ID cookies to track site visitor data and facilitate our partnerships.</p>\n<p>We may also use third-party vendors, such as Google Ad Words, Bing Ads and/or Yahoo Gemini, to promote our Services online.\nThese ad network partners may display our promotions or information regarding our Services on other websites based on your internet usage.\nAny information that these third parties collect via cookies will not be linked to your personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>If you wish to opt-out of targeted promotions based on your internet usage, you may opt-out by going to http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.\nBy completing this opt-out request, you will still receive online advertising, but it will not include targeted promotions based on cookies and online analytics.</p>\n<p>\n</p> How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect Through the
