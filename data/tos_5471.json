Policy describes the policies and procedures of Women.com, Inc.\n(\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on www.women.com (the \u201cSite\u201d) and the services, features, content or applications we offer (collectively with the Site, the \u201cServices\u201d).\nWe receive information about you from various sources, including: (i) if you register for the Site and the Services, through your user account on the Services (your \u201cAccount\u201d).\n(ii) your use of the Services generally.\nand (iii) from third party websites and services.\nWhen you use the Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? <p>This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d) gathered when you are using or accessing the Services.\nThis Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.</p> This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (\u201cThird Party Services\u201d) that you elect to access through the Service or to individuals that we do not manage or employ.\nWhile we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services.\nWe encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.\nWhat Information Do We Collect? <p>The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve and continue to operate the Services.\nIn connection with certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information.\nWe collect the following types of information from our users.</p> Account Information: <p>When you create an Account, you will provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your username, password and email address.\nYou acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account on the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not be anonymous.\nIf you access the Services through Facebook credentials, we may automatically collect certain information that could be Personal Information, such as your name, picture, and email address.\nWe will use all information available through Facebook in accordance with Facebook\u2019s policies and your preferences selected through Facebook.\nWe may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, but only rarely when we feel such information is important.\nYou may unsubscribe from these messages through your Account settings, although we, regardless, reserve the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for account recovery purposes.</p>\n<p>If you would like us to remove your account along with any associated data, please email us at feedback@women.com and we will be happy to assist you.</p> User Content: <p>Some features of the Services allow you to provide content to the Services.\nAll content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account.\nWe may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically: <p>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP address and cookie information.\nThis information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).</p> Generally, the Services automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to the Site.\nWe may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.\nThis type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.\nEmail Communications: <p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us.\nWe use this confirmation to improve our customer service.</p> Information Collected Using Cookies: <p>Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website.\nYour browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit.\nWe use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet.</p> Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are.\nAs noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with your Account if you have one.\nMost browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.\nWe strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you to take advantage the most attractive features of the Services.\nThis Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.\nWe do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer.\nFor example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer.\nInformation Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons: <p>To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties to serve advertisements, through the Services.\nThese advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third party companies called \u201cad networks.\u201d Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms.</p> Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category may be based on anonymized information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services.\nWe do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.\nTo increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a \u201cweb beacon\u201d) from an ad network to you through the Services.\nWeb beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.\nWeb beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.\nBecause your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network\u2019s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.\nAggregate Information: <p>We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services (\u201cAggregate Information\u201d).\nSome of this information is derived from Personal Information.\nThis statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser.</p> How, and With Whom, Is My Information Shared? <p>The Services are designed to help you share information with others.\nAs a result, some of the information generated through the Services is shared publicly or with third parties.</p> Public Information about Your Activity on the Services: <p>Some of your activity on and through the Services is public by default.\nThis may include, but is not limited to, content you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through the Services, such as written posts, comments, or other submissions by you to the Site.</p> Registered users may have some of this information associated with their Accounts.\nUnregistered users will not have this association, but information concerning their use of the Services (such as what pages they have visited) may be tracked anonymously through the use of cookies and stored by us.\nPlease also remember that if you choose to provide Personal Information using certain public features of the Services, then that information is governed by the privacy settings of those particular features and may be publicly available.\nIndividuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information.\nWe therefore urge you to think carefully about including any specific information you may deem private in content that you create or information that you submit through the Services.\nIP Address Information: <p>While we collect and store IP address information, that information is not made public.\nWe do at times, however, share this information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business, and as otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy.</p> Information You Elect to Share: <p>You may access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links to those Third Party Services from within the Site.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these Third Party Services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those Third Party Services\u2019 privacy policies.\nThis Privacy Policy only governs information collected on the Services.</p> Aggregate Information: <p>We share Aggregate Information with our partners, service providers and other persons with whom we conduct business.\nWe share this type of statistical data so that our partners can understand how and how often people use our Services and their services or websites, which facilitates improving both their services and how our Services interface with them.\nIn addition, these third parties may share with us non-private, aggregated or otherwise non Personal Information about you that they have independently developed or acquired.</p> Email Communications with Us: <p>As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us, such as communications relating to your Account.\nCommunications relating to your Account will be sent for purposes important to the Services, such as password recovery.\nWe may use your email address to contact you for editorial purposes, to advise you of any changes to our Site, and to send you messages about our marketing partners\u2019 products.</p> User Profile Information: <p>User profile information including your username and other information you enter may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services.\nWe will not directly reveal user email addresses to other users.</p> Information Shared with Our Agents: <p>We employ and contract with people and other entities that perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our control (our \u201cAgents\u201d).\nWe may need to share Personal Information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you.\nUnless we tell you differently, our Agents do not have any right to use Personal Information or other information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.\nYou hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information with our Agents.</p> Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers: <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.\nIn these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets.\nMoreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nYou acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p> Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others: <p>We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as it reasonably believes is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public.\nThis includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware prevention.</p> Information We Share With Your Consent: <p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nRecent\n</li>\n<li>\nQuizzes\n</li>\n<li>\nAbout
