BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nNeither you nor Disney will seek to have a dispute heard as a class action or private attorney general action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.\nNo arbitration or proceeding can be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitrations or proceedings.</p>\n<p>You and Disney agree to arbitrate, as provided below, all disputes between you (including any related disputes involving The Walt Disney Company, its subsidiaries or its affiliates), that are not resolved informally, except disputes relating to the ownership or enforcement of intellectual property rights.\n\u201c<strong>Dispute</strong>\u201d includes any dispute, action, or other controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, between you and us concerning the Disney Products or this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute, regulation, or other legal or equitable basis.\nYou and Disney empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or the formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of this Agreement are void or voidable.</p>\n<p>A.\nIn the event of a dispute, you or Disney must send to the other party a notice of dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving the notice, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested.\nYou must send any notice of dispute to Disney, 500 South Buena Vista Street, Burbank, California 91521-7620, USA, Attention: Legal.\nWe will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.\nYou and Disney will attempt to resolve a dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the notice of dispute is sent.\nAfter that sixty (60) day period and not before, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nYou may instead litigate a dispute in small claims court if the dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court, whether or not you negotiated informally first.</p>\n<p>B.\nIf you and Disney do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation or in small claims court, the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act.\nYOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.\nArbitration will be administered by JAMS Mediation, Arbitration and ADR Services (\u201c<strong>JAMS</strong>\u201d) in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \u201c<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>\u201d).\nThe JAMS Rules and instructions about how to initiate an arbitration are available at www.jamsadr.com or 1-800-352-5267.\nArbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.\nProceedings that cannot be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or online, will take place in either Los Angeles, California or the borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, whichever is more convenient for you.\nprovided, however, that if circumstances prevent you from traveling to Los Angeles or New York, JAMS may hold an in-person hearing in your hometown area.\nYou and Disney agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in either Los Angeles, California or the borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, whichever is more convenient for you, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the JAMS Rules, the party initiating the arbitration (either you or Disney) is responsible for paying the filing fee.\nHowever, if the arbitrator issues you an award of damages and: (a) that award is greater than the amount of our last written settlement offer.\nor (b) if we did not make a settlement offer, then in addition to paying for any JAMS Case Management Fees and all professional fees for the arbitrator\u2019s services, we will reimburse you for the filing fees you incurred.</p>\n<p>Except as provided above with respect to jurisdiction in Los Angeles, California and Manhattan, New York, New York, nothing in this arbitration provision shall be construed as consent by Disney to the jurisdiction of any other court with regard to disputes, claims or controversies unrelated to the Disney Products or this Agreement.</p>\n<strong>9.\nAdditional Provisions</strong>\n<p>A.\nChoice of Forum.\nYou agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement that is not subject to arbitration shall be filed, and that venue properly lies, only in the state or federal courts located in either Los Angeles, California or the borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, United States of America and you consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating such action.</p>\n<p>B.\nChoice of Law.\nThis Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the laws of the United States, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.</p>\n<p>C.\nSeverability.\nIf any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>D.\nSurvival.\nThe provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive the termination of this Agreement shall survive such termination, including but not limited to the restrictions, disclaimers, limitations, our rights to use submitted content, and rules regarding dispute resolution in Section 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8 as well as the general provisions in this Section 9.</p>\n<p>E.\nWaiver.\nNo waiver of any provision of this Agreement by us shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p> \u00a9 Disney.\nAll rights reserved.<ul>\n<li>Terms of Use</li>\n<li>Privacy
