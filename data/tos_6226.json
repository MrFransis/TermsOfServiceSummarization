informational and educational purposes, owned and operated by JustAnswer, that exists solely to broker relationships between Experts and potential Customers of those Experts who are interested in purchasing their Expert services.\nJustAnswer is not in the business of providing or selling information or education that is within any Expert\u2019s area of Expertise.\nUsers of the Site, not JustAnswer, provide the content in Posts (defined below).\nThe Experts determine which questions to answer.\nExperts are not employees or agents of JustAnswer but are independent service providers using the Site to sell their Expert knowledge to Customers and, as such, together with Customers, are simply Users of the Site.</p>\n<p>JustAnswer is not involved in the conversations between Customers and Experts and does not refer Customers to or endorse or recommend particular Experts.\nYou understand and acknowledge that JustAnswer cannot and does not edit, modify, filter, screen, monitor, endorse or guarantee the content of Posts.\nJustAnswer shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of Experts, content in Posts or the ability of Experts to answer questions.\nWe cannot ensure that an Expert will complete a transaction.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, JustAnswer reserves the right, but is not obligated, to refuse to post or to remove any content and/or remove any User\u2019s access to the Site.\n</p>\n<p>EMERGENCY QUESTIONS AND CRISIS SITUATIONS (particularly regarding medical or mental health issues) should not be directed to the Site and should, instead be directed immediately by telephone or in-person to qualified professionals (e.g.\nin the U.S., call 911).\nThe Site is not the appropriate venue to deal with such situations.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nPosts Are Not Private or Confidential.\nAnonymity</strong>\n<br>The Site is an Internet-based forum.\n<strong>Information and materials submitted in the content of your questions, answers, requests for information, responses, profiles, signatures, qualifications, comments, and posts in the Expert Forum and other places where Users communicate on the Site (collectively \"Posts\") <em>is not private or confidential, nor is it protected by attorney-client, doctor-patient, or any other privilege, and it may be read, collected, and used by others.</em>\n</strong> For example, search engines may index your questions, answers, and other Posts to allow them to appear in search engine results (e.g.\nif someone does a search on google.com or another search engine, your questions, answers, and other Posts on JustAnswer.com that relate to the search may appear in the search results list).\n<strong>To help protect your privacy, use an anonymous user name and do not include information regarding your identity or contact information in your Posts.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nVerification.\nNo Reliance on the Term \u201cExpert\u201d</strong>\n<br>Every Expert on the Site has had at least one credential relevant to the category in which they are answering questions verified by a third-party verification service, unless the Expert is answering questions in a category that is still being tested by JustAnswer in \"Beta\" (indicated by the \"Beta\" graphic after the category name on the category's landing page and/or the URL beginning with www.justanswer.com/...).\nDetails regarding the credential(s) verified for each verified Expert can be found by clicking the \"What\u2019s This\" link next to the \"Verified\" logo associated with each Expert.\nOther information about an Expert, not shown as verified, has been provided by the Expert but has not been verified.\nUse of the term \"Expert\" by JustAnswer and on the Site is only meant to describe Users who answer questions on the Site, and not to guarantee any particular level of expertise of these Experts.</p>\n<p>Regarding the verification process, JustAnswer contracts with third-party service providers to perform the verifications described above.\nJustAnswer does not itself verify the credentials of the Experts.\nThe results of the verifications are only as accurate as the information provided to and by the third-party verification services, as of the time of the providing of information to and by the third-party verification services.\nJustAnswer makes effort to verify, including using a third-party identity verification service, but cannot warrant or guarantee an Expert's purported identity.\nuser identification on the Internet is difficult.\nFor these reasons, JustAnswer cannot and does not represent, warrant or guarantee the truthfulness or accuracy of the credentials or identities of Users and information provided by Users including Experts.\nYou acknowledge that JustAnswer will not be liable for any loss or damages caused by your reliance on any information or content contained in Posts.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nInformation Not Advice.\nNo Client-Professional Relationship</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>Answers of Experts on the Site are provided by Experts and are

For example, Experts in the Legal category will provide only general information about the law, and will not provide legal advice nor propose a specific course of action for a Customer.\nBy answering questions, Experts do not intend to form, and do not form attorney-client or doctor-patient relationships with Users of the Site.\nThe laws, regulations, other governing authorities, standards, practices and procedures that apply to your particular question may differ depending on your location and information typically discovered through in-person evaluations or visits.\nExperts in some categories may be licensed, certified, educated, employed by or have experience in only particular jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No professional-client relationships shall be formed on the

JustAnswer employee or agent and the Terms (other than modifications to the Terms executed in writing by the CEO or authorized-in-fact representative of JustAnswer), the Terms will prevail.\nTo the extent the Terms are in conflict or inconsistent with one another, this Agreement and the Privacy Policy will prevail over other Terms of the Site.\nalso, this Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and disclaimers will prevail over FAQs, and other rules and policies on the Site.\nIf any provision(s) of the Terms is held by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties and the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\nJustAnswer\u2019s failure to exercise or enforce any of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of JustAnswer\u2019s right to exercise or enforce the Terms as to the same or another instance.\nHeadings in this Agreement are for purposes of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning of the Terms.</p>\n<p>You agree that JustAnswer may assign the Terms to any other entity of its choosing, with or without
