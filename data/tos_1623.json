includes personally identifiable wellness or fitness information, including various activities identified through the App on your Apple Watch or iPhone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By \u201cNon-Personally-Identifiable Information,\u201d we mean information that is not associated with an identifiable individual.\nNon-Personally-Identifiable information may include information which
