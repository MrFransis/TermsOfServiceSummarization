of these Terms of Use are intended to be severable.\nIf for any reason any provision of these Terms of Use shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any applicable jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.\nThe failure of SparkNotes to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.</p>\n<li>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</li>\n<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the \"DMCA\") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.\ncopyright law.\nIf you believe in good faith that materials hosted by SparkNotes, including User Created Content, infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send SparkNotes a notice requesting that the material be removed or access to it blocked.\nThe notice must include the following information (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\n(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on this website are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works).\n(c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow SparkNotes to locate the material on the SparkNotes Site.\n(d) the name, address, telephone number and e-mail address (if available) of the complaining party.\n(e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.\nand (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\nIf you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send SparkNotes a counter-notice.\nNotices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.\nsee http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details.\nNotices and
