topics\u2026</p> Terms of Service <p> @carlosbob </p> Terms of Service <p>Even though you may feel that reading the Terms of Use of a service like Ello is a boring waste of time, we highly recommend that you read Ello's Terms of Use (\u201cTerms\u201d).\nThe Terms are a contract between you and Ello (\u201cus\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d), which is applicable when you use our web sites (including ello.co), services, mobile applications, products, and content provided by us, globally, in existence now or in the future, forever and ever (\u201cEllo\u201d).</p>\n<p>By accessing or using Ello (whether or not you create a registered user account), you agree to be bound to the Terms.\nThat means that if you don\u2019t agree to these Terms, please don\u2019t use Ello.\nAdditionally, you must abide by our Rules, which are found here: [link to Rules], and are incorporated into the Terms.\nPlease read the Rules, which include important rules and guidelines governing the behavior we expect of Ello users, as well as the actions we may take if you do not follow the Rules.\nWhen we use the term \u201cuser\u201d in these Terms, we mean any user of Ello, regardless of whether you create a registered user account.</p>\n<p>We may update these Terms from time to time.\nWe will let you know if we make significant changes by sending a notice to the email address connected with your Ello account, or by placing a notice in a prominent place on our web site and other Ello channels (including, but not limited to app or social channels).\nIf we make a significant change, the notice we provide will indicate when the change will be effective.\nIf you do not agree with the upcoming change, please delete your account.\nIf you continue to use Ello after the stated effective date, you will be deemed to have accepted the change.</p>\n<p>To be eligible to use Ello, you must be at least 13 years old, you must be old enough to enter into a contract with us, and you must have a valid email address.\nYou must create an account to post content on Ello and to access other features offered only to account holders.\nWe require an email address, password and a username, which may or may not be your real name.\nYou must provide an email address that is actually yours.\nWhen you sign up for an Ello account, you will also be asked to choose a username and a password.\nUsernames are allocated on a first come, first serve basis.\nWe reserve the right, in its sole discretion, to (a) refuse to issue a particular username, or (b) remove or reclaim any username.&nbsp.\nFor instance, we may refuse to issue a username or reclaim a username if a third party that owns a trademark complains that a username violates that third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, or if we determine that such user name impersonates someone else, misappropriates a person\u2019s right of publicity, is illegal, or offensive.\nYour username is how you will be publicly identified, along with any photo you associate with your account.</p> You Have Choices <p>While we are constantly evolving and we expect new features, functions and settings to be introduced regularly, you can always go to \u201cSettings\u201d to customize your Ello experience.\nFor instance, you can choose whether your profile is publicly accessible outside of Ello and whether to allow other users to comment on your posts.</p>\n<p>If you may have sexually explicit content (e.g., nude photos) posted in your account, please designate your Ello profile as \u201cNot Suitable for Work,\u201d or NSFW.</p> When You Post on Ello <p>We don\u2019t claim ownership over any Content that you post on Ello.\n\u201cContent\u201d means any content or creative expression that you\u2019re able to upload or post on Ello, including text, images, files, animations, logos, or comments.\nHowever, when you post or transfer Content to Ello, you give us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, world-wide, perpetual, transferable license to use, store, reproduce, adapt (so we can properly post your Content), distribute and publicly display your Content in order to provide Ello.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for the Content you submit to Ello.\nYou assume all risks associated with it, including accuracy, intellectual property claims, or any other legal rights claims.\nYou represent and warrant that (i) you either own the Content you post, or that you have all necessary rights to post that Content on Ello, (ii) your Content does not infringe any third party\u2019s rights, and (iii) you can grant the licenses you grant in these Terms.</p>\n<p>When you post on Ello, you are agreeing to allow other Ello users (unless you set your Settings to prevent public display) to view, distribute and display your Content.\nConsider the Content you post on Ello to be publicly available indefinitely since it may be distributed by other Ello users through social media or otherwise, or be cached on third party search engines, even after your Ello account is terminated.\nBe aware that it is extremely difficult to remove content from the Internet that becomes publicly available.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right (though we have no obligation) to refuse or remove any Content you post or transfer to Ello for any reason.</p>\n<p>You understand that when using Ello, you may be exposed to content from a variety of sources, and that Ello is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of, or relating to, such content.\nYou may be exposed to content that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, sexually explicit and other adult oriented content, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you may have against Ello with respect thereto.\nIf you do not wish to see sexually explicit content, please go to your Settings and choose the NSFW option indicating you do not want to see sexually explicit material.\nWhile we cannot guarantee that you won\u2019t see sexually explicit material if you choose not to, we will try to prevent it from happening by allowing you to amend your setting accordingly.</p>\n<p>Unless requested by law enforcement or the government, or as otherwise allowed by our Privacy Policy, we will never sell, distribute or share your Content outside of Ello without your permission.\nHowever, as mentioned above, other Ello users may distribute and share your Content outside of Ello.</p>\n<p>At any time, you may delete your Content from Ello, or delete your account in your account \u201cSettings.\u201d Additionally, we reserve the right to terminate or suspend your account at any time, with or without notice.\nWhen your account is terminated, you no longer have the right to access or use Ello.\nWhen you delete Content or your account is terminated, we will use reasonable efforts to remove all of your Content from Ello.\nHowever, there may be a delay between your request and when the Content or account is publicly visible due to technical or operational limitations.\nNote that we do retain backups of Content on our servers, and some of your Content may remain on our servers (though not publicly visible) even after you ask to have it deleted.\nIf you delete your account or Content, it may be permanently unrecoverable.</p>\n<p>We may modify our Services at any time, since Ello is a constantly changing and evolving service.\nWe may delete or modify any part or all of this Service at any time, without notice.\nWe may add features and functionality from time to time, and we reserve the right to limit use of certain features or functions.</p> User Activity <p>If you haven't uploaded a profile picture or header image within 60 days of creating your account, we may remove your account and allow another user to select your username.\nWe will send you a warning e-mail before doing so.</p>\n<p>Also, if you haven't logged into your account for 365 days, we may delete your account to make room for new users.\nAgain, we will send you a warning e-mail to let you know that your account is about to be removed, giving you a chance to log in and keep your account.</p>\n<p>If you use a robot to post on Ello, or to sign up for multiple accounts, or to follow lots of other users, we may delete your account.\nIf you follow too many other users we may delete your account if we feel you are not acting like a human being.</p> Property we Own and Restrictions <p>Ello owns all rights to our logo, Ello, and our website, including any intellectual property rights related to them.\nYou may not reuse, distribute, copy, or duplicate any part of Ello, including the Ello HTML/CSS, JavaScipt, logos, or visual design elements without express written permission from Ello.</p> Content You Post Privacy <p>When you use Ello, you agree to the Ello Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms.\nPlease read the Privacy Policy because it describes what information and data we collect and how we use it.</p> Paid Services <p>Ello may offer some features or functionality for a fee.\nFees are stated in US dollars, and you\u2019ll be responsible for any applicable sales taxes or other charges arising from the transaction.\nEven though you\u2019re paying for a feature or functionality, you don\u2019t own it \u2013 you\u2019re purchasing the right to use or access that feature or functionality.\nFees are non-refundable.\nEllo may charge fees at any time in its discretion.\nWe will not collect credit card numbers \u2013 instead, we will use a trusted third party credit card or payment processor.</p> No Children Under 13 <p>You need to be 13 years or older to use Ello.\nIf you\u2019re under 13,

serve advertisements and that does not sell information about its users or use of the Site (defined below) to third parties, Ello has also taken unique steps that help you control how much information about you is shared when you use the Site.</p>\n<p>Please read this document in its entirety and take it seriously.\nIt explains Ello's privacy practices, and what kind of information we collect when you use our web site located at ello.co and related mobile apps (collectively, the \u201cSite\u201d).\nand also how you can opt-out of sharing some of this information.</p> Information Ello Collects <p>When you visit The Site, we may collect and store general, non-identifiable information about what pages you access, your general geographic location (e.g., a city, but not a street address), the device you are using, an anonymized version of your IP address, and the address of websites that refer you to the Site.\nWe also store your email address and UserID that you choose when you register for an account.</p>\n<p>We may use this information to protect Ello and its users from spam, viruses, identity theft, illegal or harmful activities, as well as to understand how people use the Site, which features work and which don't, and to help us develop and improve the Site's features and services.\nFor example, if we create a feature that everybody is using, we want to know about that, so we collect data about how much different features are used.\nAdditionally, if we have a lot of visitors from The Netherlands (which we do) then we might translate our Help section into Dutch (which we are considering, except none of us speak Dutch).\nWe may create anonymous records by excluding personally identifiable information (such as your name) from records.</p>\n<p>We also collect any information you provide us if you choose to contact us directly or post on our web site or on your page, including any personally identifiable information.\nWe use this information for the purpose you provided it \u2013 for instance, to provide support or answer questions \u2013 and to provide you the Site.</p>\n<p>Ello uses tools and third party services to gather and aggregate general information about anonymous user behavior.\nThese tools and services may use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the site, compiling reports on site activity for us and providing other services relating to site activity and internet usage.\nThese tools and services may also transfer this information to parties where required to do so by law, or where such additional parties process the information on the tool or third party service\u2019s behalf.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the tools or third party services used to gather information on Ello\u2019s behalf collect information in such a way that neither Ello, nor the tools and services, can easily trace saved information back to any individual user.</p>\n<p>Ello is unique in that we offer our users the option to opt-out of anonymous information gathering through third party services on the user settings page.\nWe also respect \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser settings.\nOn your Ello settings page, you can choose to turn off anonymous information gathering through third party services completely when you visit the Site.\nIf you choose either of these options, we make best efforts not to send any data about your user behavior, anonymized or otherwise, to any third party service providers.\nPlease be aware that there may be other services that you are using and that are not controlled by Ello (including Google, Google Chrome Web Browser, Android Operating System, and YouTube) that may continue to send information to third party service providers when you use the Site, even if you have asked us not to send information through our services.</p>\n<p>If you want to invite a friend to the Site, you will need to provide us their email address.</p> Email Communications <p>From time to time we may email you information about Ello that we think is necessary and important.\nBy opening or maintaining an account with Ello, you agree to receive administrative emails as part of your basic service.\nYou can always opt-out of non-administrative emails.</p>\n<p>If anyone ever contacts you and asks for your Ello password, they are probably trying to scam you.\nEllo will never do this.\nPlease don't give your Ello password to anyone, and let us know about it so we can hunt them down and execute suitable punishment.</p>\n<p>We may share your information, including personal information, with third parties under several circumstances, including (1) if you tell us it is OK to do so (2) if we believe that we need to do so to comply with applicable law or legal obligations (3) if we contract with a third party service provider to offer services for you \u2014 for example, with a credit card processing company if you decide to buy something through the Site.</p>\n<p>Ello does not have any affiliated companies right now.\nBut if we do in the future, we may share information with them, too.</p>\n<p>We will do our best to resist baseless legal requests to access information.\nHowever, we may disclose your information or content to satisfy a law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order.\nEllo's policy is to give you, advance notice if we are going to release your information unless by law we are prohibited from or advised against doing so.\nIf we think that by disclosing your information we may prevent serious harm to Ello, its users, you, or anyone else for that matter, we may do so without notifying you.\nFinally, if may disclose your information if we believe it is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address safety, fraud, or security concerns related to Ello.</p> Ello is a Public Network <p>The Site is a platform built for posting and sharing content publicly.\nYou should assume that anything you post or upload on the

altogether (there\u2019s a link to do so on your personal settings page).</p>\n<p>However, we may store backups of your content on our servers, even after it is deleted or after you delete your account.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, deleting your account or specific content doesn\u2019t mean that your content hasn\u2019t been copied or shared on the Site, and on other parts of the internet by people or services that have nothing to do with the Site.</p>\n<p>We strongly suggest that you consider this when deciding what to post and what not to post on the Site (or anywhere on the Internet, for that matter).\nPlease post responsibly!</p> Ello and Cookies <p>Ello uses cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Site.\nA cookie is a small amount

your personal preferences regarding privacy, data collection, and content and data sharing.</p> Data Storage and Deletion of Accounts and Data <p>We are committed to protecting the security of your information.\nWe use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.\nDespite these measures, you should know that we cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with information and mistakes may happen.</p>\n<p>You can access or change your personal profile and contact information or delete your account through your Ello personal settings page.</p>\n<p>If you choose to delete or deactivate your account, you can no longer retrieve your content or reactivate your account, and we cannot do so for you.\nAlso, your username may become available for another person to use.</p>\n<p>Ello stores its data on servers run by authorized affiliates and service providers.\nWe or an authorized affiliate and/or service provider we work with to store data may keep backups of Ello\u2019s data and code, which may or may not include posts and other information that you put on the Site, even after you have deleted your account.\nTherefore, even after you delete your account, your data may remain in stored backups, although it will be no longer visible or

Us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ello takes data privacy seriously.\nAs a network that does not serve advertisements and that does not sell information about its users or use of the Site (defined below) to third parties, Ello has also taken unique steps that help you control how much information about you is shared when you use the Site.</p>\n<p>Please read this document in its entirety and take it seriously.\nIt explains Ello's privacy practices, and what kind of information we collect when you use our web site located at ello.co and related mobile apps (collectively, the \u201cSite\u201d).\nand also how you can opt-out of sharing some of this information.</p> Information Ello Collects <p>When you visit The Site, we may collect and store general, non-identifiable information about what pages you access, your general geographic location (e.g., a city, but not a street address), the device you are using, an anonymized version of your IP address, and the address of websites that refer you to the Site.\nWe also store your email address and UserID that you choose when you register for an account.</p>\n<p>We may use this information to protect Ello and its users from spam, viruses, identity theft, illegal or harmful activities, as well as to understand how people use the Site, which features work and which don't, and to help us develop and improve the Site's features and services.\nFor example, if we create a feature that everybody is using, we want to know about that, so we collect data about how much different features are used.\nAdditionally, if we have a lot of visitors from The Netherlands (which we do) then we might translate our Help section into Dutch (which we are considering, except none of us speak Dutch).\nWe may create anonymous records by excluding personally identifiable information (such as your name) from records.</p>\n<p>We also collect any information you provide us if you choose to contact us directly or post on our web site or on your page, including any personally identifiable information.\nWe use this information for the purpose you provided it \u2013 for instance, to provide support or answer questions \u2013 and to provide you the Site.</p>\n<p>Ello uses tools and third party services to gather and aggregate general information about anonymous user behavior.\nThese tools and services may use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the site, compiling reports on site activity for us and providing other services relating to site activity and internet usage.\nThese tools and services may also transfer this information to parties where required to do so by law, or where such additional parties process the information on the tool or third party service\u2019s behalf.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the tools or third party services used to gather information on Ello\u2019s behalf collect information in such a way that neither Ello, nor the tools and services, can easily trace saved information back to any individual user.</p>\n<p>Ello is unique in that we offer our users the option to opt-out of anonymous information gathering through third party services on the user settings page.\nWe also respect \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser settings.\nOn your Ello settings page, you can choose to turn off anonymous information gathering through third party services completely when you visit the Site.\nIf you choose either of these options, we make best efforts not to send any data about your user behavior, anonymized or otherwise, to any third party service providers.\nPlease be aware that there may be other services that you are using and that are not controlled by Ello (including Google, Google Chrome Web Browser, Android Operating System, and YouTube) that may continue to send information to third party service providers when you use the Site, even if you have asked us not to send information through our services.</p>\n<p>If you want to invite a friend to the Site, you will need to provide us their email address.</p> Email Communications <p>From time to time we may email you information about Ello that we think is necessary and important.\nBy opening or maintaining an account with Ello, you agree to receive administrative emails as part of your basic service.\nYou can always opt-out of non-administrative emails.</p>\n<p>If anyone ever contacts you and asks for your Ello password, they are probably trying to scam you.\nEllo will never do this.\nPlease don't give your Ello password to anyone, and let us know about it so we can hunt them down and execute suitable punishment.</p>\n<p>We may share your information, including personal information, with third parties under several circumstances, including (1) if you tell us it is OK to do so (2) if we believe that we need to do so to comply with applicable law or legal obligations (3) if we contract with a third party service provider to offer services for you \u2014 for example, with a credit card processing company if you decide to buy something through the Site.</p>\n<p>Ello does not have any affiliated companies right now.\nBut if we do in the future, we may share information with them, too.</p>\n<p>We will do our best to resist baseless legal requests to access information.\nHowever, we may disclose your information or content to satisfy a law, regulation, legal process, governmental request, or governmental order.\nEllo's policy is to give you, advance notice if we are going to release your information unless by law we are prohibited from or advised against doing so.\nIf we think that by disclosing your information we may prevent serious harm to Ello, its users, you, or anyone else for that matter, we may do so without notifying you.\nFinally, if may disclose your information if we believe it is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address safety, fraud, or security concerns related to Ello.</p> Ello is a Public Network <p>The Site is a

page).</p>\n<p>However, we may store backups of your content on our servers, even after it is deleted or after you delete your account.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, deleting your account or specific content doesn\u2019t mean that your content hasn\u2019t been copied or shared on the Site, and on other parts of the internet by people or services that have nothing to do with the Site.</p>\n<p>We strongly suggest that you consider this when deciding what to post and what not to post on the Site (or anywhere on the Internet, for that matter).\nPlease post responsibly!</p> Ello and Cookies <p>Ello uses

risks associated with information and mistakes may happen.</p>\n<p>You can access or change your personal profile and contact information or delete your account through your Ello personal settings page.</p>\n<p>If you choose to delete or deactivate your account, you can no longer retrieve your content or reactivate your account, and we cannot do so for you.\nAlso, your username may become

store data may keep backups of Ello\u2019s data and code, which may or may not include posts and other information that you put on the Site, even after you have deleted your account.\nTherefore, even

Work.</p>\n<p>Whenever your Work is published by Ello or the Released Parties, all reasonable efforts will be taken to ensure you will be credited.\nHowever, failure to provide accurate credit shall

experience for visitors.</p> General Information about cookies and local storage <p>Cookies can most easily be explained as leaving a small trail in your browser confirming where you have been on the internet or navigation from certain emails that you open.</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small file typically consisting of a string of letters and numbers that is sent by a web server to a web browser (e.g.\nGoogle Chrome), and stored by the browser.\nThis small file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>\n<p>Cookies can be used by web servers to distinguish and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and to improve the experience for returning users.</p>\n<p>Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies.\nA session cookie will expire at the end of the user session, effectively when the web browser is closed.\nA persistent cookie will be stored by the browser and will remain valid until a set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the expiry date).</p>\n<p>Local storage is a similar storage system to cookies but differs in many ways.\nIt is also used to store session and persistent data, but the data is not sent to the server by default, and it cannot be retrieved using basic HTTP methods, and so has some security advantages over cookies.</p> How we use cookies and local storage <p>We may
