Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (subject to exemptions that apply to us under that Act).\nHowever, due to the nature of some of our business activities, from time to time, we will handle personal information relying on the media exemption in the Act where appropriate.\nWhere we do so, we will ensure that we comply with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards.\nWe may also rely on related bodies corporate, employee records and other exemptions in the Act.\nIf you require more information on the collection and use of personal information in the course of journalism, please visit the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards at www.presscouncil.org.au/privacy-principles.</p>\n<p>We may, from time to time, review and update this policy, including taking account of new or amended laws, new technology and/or changes to our operations.\nAll personal information held by us will be governed by the most recent updated policy.\nYour privacy matters to us, so whether you are new to Fairfax or are a long time user, please take the time to get to know our practices.</p>What is Personal Information<p>When used in this policy, the term \u201cpersonal

age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card, direct debit or PayPal account information.\nIf the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.</p>What Personal Information Do We Collect and Hold<p>We may collect the following types of personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>name;</li>\n<li>mailing or street address;</li>\n<li>email address;</li>\n<li>telephone number;</li>\n<li>age or

our website, without bothering you with a request to register or log-in.\nIt also helps us keep track of products or services you view, so that we can send you news about those products or
