when you use Last.fm.\nThese rules aren\u2019t just the \u201cblahblahblah-yawn-small print\u201d \u2013 these are the legal terms of use and so we recommend you read them carefully so you know what you\u2019ve agreed to.</li>\n<li>As with all websites, Last.fm, its services and software will change over time, both in terms of the content displayed and the functionality offered.\nWe reserve the right to make those changes, and to change these terms in line with them.\nSoftware made available for download by Last.fm remains the property of Last.fm, and we reserve the right to update and change that too.</li>\n<li>Please don\u2019t reproduce any part of the website or content without our permission.</li>\n<li>A lot of information and content on Last.fm is provided by third parties \u2013 both users and other third parties \u2013 and the accuracy and reliability of that information is entirely the responsibility of those parties.\nLikewise, you may sometimes find links on Last.fm to other websites.\nLast.fm cannot be held responsible for the content of those sites.\nLinks, like everything else added by members of the Last.fm community, are entirely the responsibility of the individuals who have added them.</li>\n<li>By using Last.fm, you also agree to our Privacy Policy - please read our Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>If you\u2019ve found content on the website that

very seriously, so provide all the information set out in Section 10 and we will act swiftly to deal with any claims.</li>\n<li>We have a detailed Acceptable Use policy, but much like the Community Guidelines they boil down into a few fairly simple concepts: play nicely, respect other members of the community and use common sense.\nIf we believe someone isn\u2019t playing fairly and within the spirit of the guidelines then we\u2019re entitled to ban that user at our sole discretion.\nWe don\u2019t like doing it, but sometimes it\u2019s the most appropriate response.</li>\n<li>If you enter a competition or use software alongside Last.fm then make sure you read any accompanying Terms and Conditions carefully too, because they may have conditions in addition to this document.</li>\n<li>When you use Last.fm and all of its software and services, you accept it \u201cas is\u201d.\nLike human beings, we have the odd fault or two and we\u2019re constantly updating and improving every aspect of Last.fm, ironing out new-found bugs and making subtle changes to things like our recommendation algorithms.\nAs a result, Last.fm should never be considered a \u201cfinished product\u201d, and by using Last.fm you accept it \u2013 warts and all.</li>\n<li>Last.fm is based in London \u2013 we quite like it here \u2013 and this document is to be interpreted in line with the laws governing
