not lose money.</p>\n<p>B.\nYou are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Axie-related transactions.\nAxie Infinity is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.</p>\n<p>C.\nThe App does not store, send, or receive Axies.\nThis is because Axies exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App\u2019s supporting blockchain on the Ronin network.\nAny transfer of Axies occurs only on the Ronin network.</p>\n<p>D.\nThere are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet.\nYou accept and acknowledge that Axie Infinity will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ronin network, however caused.</p>\n<p>E.\nA lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the Axie ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Axies.</p>\n<p>F.\nThe regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Axie ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of Axies.</p>\n<p>G.\nUpgrades by Sky Mavis to the Ronin Network may have unintended, adverse effects on all Axie Infinity assets.</p>15.\nINDEMNIFICATION<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless, including our subsidiaries,
