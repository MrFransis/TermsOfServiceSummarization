Google (i) has Your consent for any Customer Data or any Third Party's consent for the Third Party's Customer Data.\n(ii) concludes that it is required by law or has a good faith belief that access, preservation or disclosure of Customer Data is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Google, its users or the public.\nor (iii) provides Customer Data in certain limited circumstances to third parties to carry out tasks on Google's behalf (e.g., billing or data storage) with strict restrictions that prevent the data from being used or shared except as directed by

prominent link to the site \"How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps\", (located at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, or any other URL Google may provide from time to time).\nYou will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that a User is provided with clear and comprehensive information about, and consents to, the storing and accessing of cookies or other information on the User\u2019s device where such activity occurs in connection with the Service and where providing such information and obtaining such consent is required by law.\n</p>\n<p> You must

no longer be available to You.\n</p> 15.\nModifications to Terms of Service and Other Policies.\n<p> Google may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to the Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to the Service.\nYou should look at the terms regularly.\nGoogle will post notice of modifications to these terms at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/, the Google Analytics Policies at www.google.com/analytics/policies/, or other policies referenced in these terms at the applicable URL for such policies.\nChanges will not apply retroactively and will

modification of this Agreement will be binding unless (i) in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Google, (ii) You accept updated terms online, or (iii) You continue to use the Service after Google has posted updates to the Agreement or to any policy governing the Service.\n</p> 16.\nMiscellaneous, Applicable Law and Venue.\n<p> Google will be excused from performance in this Agreement to the extent that performance is prevented, delayed or obstructed by causes beyond its reasonable control.\nThis Agreement (including any amendment agreed upon by the parties in writing) represents the complete agreement between You and Google concerning its subject matter, and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between the parties.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.\nThis Agreement will be governed by and construed under the laws of the state of California without reference to its conflict of law principles.\nIn the event of any conflicts between foreign law, rules, and regulations, and California law, rules, and regulations, California law, rules and regulations will prevail and govern.\nEach party agrees to submit to the exclusive and personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.\nThe United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to this Agreement.\nThe Software is controlled by U.S.\nExport Regulations, and it may be not be exported to or used by embargoed countries or individuals.\nAny notices to Google must be sent to: Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, with a copy to Legal Department, via

Your rights in this Agreement without Google's prior written consent, and any such attempt is void.\nThe relationship between Google and You is not one of a legal partnership relationship, but is one of independent contractors.\nThis Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto.\nThe following sections of this Agreement will

(<strong>\u201cFirebase Linkage\u201d</strong>) as part of using the Service, the following terms, in addition to Sections 1-16 above, will also apply to You, and will also govern Your use of the Service, including with respect to Your use of Firebase Linkage.\nOther than as modified below, all other terms will stay the same and continue to apply.\nIn the event of a conflict between this Section 17 and Sections 1-16 above, the terms in Section 17 will govern and control solely with respect to Your use of the Firebase Linkage.\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The following definition in Section 1 is modified as follows: <ol>\n<li>\"Hit\" means a collection of interactions that results in data being sent to the Service and processed.\nExamples of Hits may include page view hits and ecommerce hits.\nA Hit can be a call to the Service by various libraries, but does not have to be so (e.g., a Hit can be delivered to the Service by other Google Analytics-supported protocols and mechanisms made available by the Service to You).\nFor the sake of clarity, a Hit does not include certain events whose collection reflects interactions with certain Properties capable of supporting multiple data streams, and which may include screen views and custom events (the collection of events, an <strong>\u201cEnhanced Packet\u201d</strong>).\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The following sentence is added to the end of Section 7 as follows: <ol>\n<li>If You link a Property to a Firebase project (<strong>\u201cFirebase Linkage\u201d</strong>) (i) certain data from Your Property, including Customer Data, may be made accessible within or to any other entity or personnel according to permissions set in Firebase and (ii) that Property may have certain Service settings modified by authorized personnel of Firebase (notwithstanding the settings You may have designated for that Property within the Service).\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> Last Updated June 17, 2019 </p>\n<p> Follow us

Features<p>Google Analytics Advertising Features allow you to enable features in Analytics that aren't available through standard implementations.\nAdvertising features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remarketing with Google Analytics</li>\n<li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>\n<li>Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</li>\n<li>Integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data for advertising purposes, including the collection of data via advertising cookies and identifiers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By enabling the Advertising Features, you enable Google Analytics to collect data about your traffic via Google advertising cookies and identifiers, in addition to data collected through a standard Google Analytics implementation.\nRegardless of how you send data to Google Analytics (for example, via the Google Analytics tracking code, Google Analytics SDK, or the Measurement Protocol), if you use Google Analytics Advertising Features, you must adhere to this policy.</p>\n<p> When you use Google Analytics Advertising Features, you are the sole controller under all applicable data protection legislation.\n</p>\n<p>This means you will not identify users or facilitate the merging of personally identifiable information with additional information collected through any Google advertising product or feature unless you have robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that identification or merger, and are using a Google Analytics feature that expressly supports such identification or merger.\nIrrespective of users\u2019 consent, you must not attempt to disaggregate data that Google reports in aggregate.</p>\n<p>Learn more about PII in Google's contracts and policies</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If you've enabled any Google Analytics Advertising features, you are required to notify your visitors by disclosing the following information in your privacy policy:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Google Analytics Advertising Features you've implemented.</li>\n<li>How you and third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as Google advertising cookies) or other third-party identifiers together.</li>\n<li>How visitors can opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features you use, including through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the NAI's consumer opt-out).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also encourage you to point users to Google Analytics' currently available opt-outs for the web.</p> European Union user consent policy <p>When using Google Analytics Advertising Features, you must also comply with the European Union User Consent Policy.</p> Interest-based advertising <p>If you've enabled interest-based advertising, including Remarketing, with Google Analytics in connection with other Google services, you must follow the policies applicable to those Google services (like the Google Ads Policy for Personalized advertising and its sensitive category restrictions, and the&nbsp;Platform Program Policies).\nIf you use Google Analytics to collect sensitive information about your visitors, as described in the Google Ads sensitive category restrictions, you may not use Google Analytics to collect data for the purpose of interest based advertising.\nYou can disable interest-based advertising&nbsp;via the advanced ads-personalization setting.</p>\n<p>Because laws across countries and territories vary, and because Google Analytics can be used in many ways, Google is unable to provide the exact language you need to include in your privacy policy.\nOnly you understand the unique aspects and special considerations of your business, and your privacy policy should account for this information that only you can provide.</p>\n<p>This policy was last updated December 9, 2019.</p>
