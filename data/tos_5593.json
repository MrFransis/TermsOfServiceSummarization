indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like: \"believe\", \"anticipate\", \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"project\", \"will\", \"shall\" and other words or phrases with similar meaning.\nLFG claims the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA.<br>\n<br>\nForward-looking statements involve risks and

risk factors.\nFurther, it is not possible to assess the impact of all risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nGiven these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undo reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of
