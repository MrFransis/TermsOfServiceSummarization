party tracking or analytics services, so your activity on this website stays with us (and your ISP).\nWe use open source Piwik web analytics platform to measure usage on our website, which is hosted on our servers.\nPiwik is used to analyze in aggregate information about our website visitors.\nWhen your web browser loads a page on our site, a small snippet of JavaScript code is executed within your browser which submits information such as your browser user-agent, language, screen resolution, referring website, and a subset of your IP address (first 3 octets).\nWe may set cookies if you were referred to us through our affiliate program in order to compensate the person who referred you, if you choose to sign up.\nThe affiliate does not see any of this information.</p>\nWhen You Sign Up\n<p>We only require a username and password when you signup to our service.\nEmail can be provided if you wish to be able to recover your password in case you forget it, as well as receive periodic service updates.\nWe use 3rd party payment processors.\nWhen you pay for a premium account, we store the transaction ID of your payment for a period of 30 days for fraud prevention purposes.</p>\nWhen You Use Our Service\n<p>When you use Windscribe, we keep the following data associated with your account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Total amount of bytes transferred in a 30 day period.\nBandwidth reset date is in your \"My Account\" section.</li>\n<li>Timestamp of your last activity on the Windscribe network.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This data is used to enforce free tier limitations, prevent abuse and weed out inactive accounts.</p>\n<p>The following data is <strong>NOT</strong> stored:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Historical record of VPN sessions</li>\n<li>Source IP</li>\n<li>Sites you visited</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are firm believer that one's browsing history should be taken to one's grave.</p>\nWhen You Are Actively Connected to a Server\n<p>For the duration of your connection the following is stored in <strong>server's memory</strong>.\nThis data is immediately discarded when you disconnect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OpenVPN/IKEv2 username</li>\n<li>Time of connection</li>\n<li>Amount of data transferred</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following data is stored in a central location:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of parallel connections at any given time to prevent rampant abuse and account sharing.\n</li>\n<li>A counter is incremented that stores total number of bytes downloaded/uploaded in a 30 day period.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anything that is not mentioned above is not stored.</p>\n<p>Read More</p>\n<p>The following is no longer applicable to Windscribe, as we replaced a bulk of the VPN authentication/bandwidth accounting system with a bespoke one in Q2 2018, which no longer requires us to delete anything after you disconnect, as there is nothing to delete.<br>\nVast majority if not all of VPN providers use FreeRadius for authentication and parallel connection enforcement which MOST providers have.\nIn default mode, the \"raw data\" looks like this.\nAs you see, it shows the openvpn username, server IP connected to, when the session was started, terminated, and how much data was transferred.\nThe column titled \"callingstationid\", by default, has the connected user's IP address.\nWhen we still used this system, we modified our instance to not supply this information.\nSo to check how many parallel connections a user has, you simply look in this table and check how many records exist for a single username, with no session termination timestamp.\nAfter the user's session is terminated, the record stays in the database.\nUnless the provider physically removes the record via a cleanup script, it will stay there forever.\nProviders that keep logs, store this data for 30 or more days, and then remove it...\nallegedly.<br>\nOur bespoke system eliminates the need for this session table entirely.\nThis data resides only in server's memory while you're connected, and is immediately discarded by the VPN server when you disconnect.\nSince it doesn't get logged into a permanent database, there is nothing to delete.\n</p>\nWhen You Leave\n<p>If for some strange reason you decide not to use our service anymore, the only piece of information that will remain is your username, password and email address (if you provided it).\nWe periodically prune inactive accounts.\nYou can delete your account at any time in the \"My Account\" section.</p>\nUser Data Requests\n<p>Since we store the bare minimum for a customer to actually use our service, any request for user data would yield nothing of value.\nAs we do not store any historical logs on who used which IP address, and since IPs are shared by dozens/hundreds of people at any given moment, so we cannot tie any activity to a specific account.</p>\n<p>View Transparency Report</p> Changes to Policy\n<p>We will do our best to avoid any changes, which includes moving the company to a different jurisdiction.\nIf drastic policy changes are required due to a race of giant spiders enslaving all of humanity and forcing us to log our users under the threat of consumption, and we cannot continue providing service under the above mentioned terms, users (with valid email accounts) will be notified.\nThat will be the least of your concern however, you know, because of the giant spiders.</p> ",

you discover a real or potential security issue.</li>\n<li>Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.</li>\n<li>Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability\u2019s presence.</li>\n<li>Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.</li>\n<li>Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.</li>\n</ul>\nScope\n<p>The scope of this program includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website -

engineering</li>\n<li>Exfiltrate large amounts of data</li>\n</ul>\nOur Response\n<p>After submitting a report you can expect to hear from us within 48 hrs, but usually a lot less.\nWe will attempt to replicate the issue, and deploy a fix as soon as possible.\nIn most cases this will happen pretty quickly, but in cases of application level vulnerabilities that require an update, it may take longer.</p>\nBug Bounty\n<p>If your report is verified and deemed to be an issue, you are eligible for compensation for your efforts.\nThe actual amount solely depends on the severity of the issue as determined by us.\nHistorically, we've paid out anywhere between $100 and $5000 for disclosed vulnerabilities.</p>\nReporting\n<p>To disclose an issue, please email us at hello (AT)
