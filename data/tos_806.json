of July 1, 1901.\nOr, in more human-friendly language, we are an official French charitable organisation which notably publishes the website Lichess.org.<br>\n<br>Lichess is free/libre open source software, with the express charitable purpose of promoting and encouraging the play and study of chess.\nThis means that in addition to using our website and its features, technologies or software for free (collectively, the \u201cservices\u201d), you can also inspect, copy, and (within certain licensing requirements) use our source code.\nTo discover more about our values and philosophy, you can find out more here and here.<br>\n<br>These Terms of Service (Terms) are a legally binding agreement made by and between us (Lichess.org) and you individually, and if it additionally applies to you, any organisation or entity you represent (collectively, \u201cyou\u201d).\nThis page governs your use of our website and the Services that we offer, so take care to read through it carefully.\nAlthough in some places we\u2019ve had to use certain legal phrasing and terminology for these Terms to be valid, overall we\u2019ve done our best to explain everything in clear everyday English.<br>\n<br>By accessing or using any part of this website or our services, we take that to mean that you have read, understood, and agree to contract with us on the basis of these Terms.\nIf you do not agree, do not use our website or services.\nFrom time to time, we may need to make changes to these Terms.\nWe will edit the \u201clast modified\u201d date when we do, and if you continue using our website and/or services after that, we will take that to mean you have accepted the changes to our contract.\n<br>\n<br>This TOS should be read in conjunction with our GDPR compliant privacy policy, and with our Fair Play and Community Guidelines.\nThese are incorporated into these Terms by reference, and make up part of the legally binding agreement we're both entering into.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Useful information and resources</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Support our

invite anyone to access our website, although it is solely at our discretion which parts of the website - if any - are accessible to you.\nFrom time to time, all users may be affected by any maintenance we may need to carry out, or rarely, technological disruption.\nWe are not liable for any losses or harm to you, real or otherwise, for the website being unavailable at any time.\nWe are also not responsible if some parts or all of the website does not work with your hardware or software.\n</p>\n<p>You are free to decide if you want to register an account or not - it\u2019s entirely optional.\nBear in mind that some of our features on our website are not fully accessible without an account (\u201canonymous\u201d users).\nThe features accessible to anonymous users and registered users may also change from time to time, and we reserve the right to amend, suspend or entirely remove any aspect or feature of our website.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All users, registered or anonymous, must also comply with our Fair Play and Community Guidelines, which cover that our website must be used in a lawful way.\nFor the purposes of this section of our Terms, you must particularly comply with the following rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must not attempt to gain unlawful access to the website, any server connected to our website, any database or computer connected to our website;</li>\n<li>You must not attack our website via any kind of volumetric attack, or attempt to exploit any bugs, weaknesses and vulnerabilities present in our website.\nAttempts to identify weaknesses in our site to report to us are appreciated, so long as they do not breach the relevant rules.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>You must not misuse the site by introducing harmful materials, programmes, or code designed to negatively affect the operation of any computer software or hardware.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to being against our Terms, these particular rules are also against the law, and you may be committing a criminal offence by engaging in these activities.\nWe reserve the right to report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authority, and we reserve the right to cooperate with them by disclosing relevant information to them.\nUsers engaging in these activities will immediately have access to their account removed, and a public label added to the account that our Terms were violated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You are welcome to use and reproduce our website for your personal and commercial use, so long as you comply with the relevant licenses applicable to the website and their component parts (such as fonts, designs, piece sets).\nPlease refer to the \u201cLicenses\u201d section of these Terms for further information.\n</p>\n<p>For all purposes, commercial or non-commercial, for registered or anonymous users, our website is provided \u201cas is\u201d and we can\u2019t guarantee the full or partial functioning or full or partial accuracy of what is on our website.\nConsequently, we cannot be held liable for any of your damage or losses sustained, of any type.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Using our services</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to publishing our website, we also offer services which we invite anyone to utilise so long as the relevant licenses and our rules are followed in using them.\nOur services include (but are not limited to): API access, content, game databases, puzzle sets, piece and board sets, streamer sections, coaches sections, user blogs, relying on our moderation or other expertise, and all or some of our software.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can use our services for your own personal or commercial use, such as in your own applications, projects, research, or products.\nPlease refer to our Fair Play and Community Guidelines which may further apply to the use of or access to some or all of our services.\nFor further information relating to the licensing of using some or all of these services, please refer to the \u201cLicenses\u201d section - as different licenses may apply to different services.</p>\n<p>All use of our services are subject to reasonable caps, limits, restrictions, or other bottle-necking which are purely determined at Lichess\u2019 discretion.\nThis includes private messages which are subject to a reasonable use limitation, as well as public chat messages.\nFor more information on these points, please refer to our privacy policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The services available may change from time to time, and we reserve the right to amend, suspend or entirely remove any aspect or feature from our services.\nOur services are provided \u201cas is\u201d and may require your own efforts, modification, and resources to ensure they work satisfactorily.\nWe cannot guarantee the full or partial function or full or partial accuracy of any of our services.\nConsequently, we cannot be held liable for any of your damage or losses sustained, of any type.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, we reserve the right to change the licensing of our services, or the services we own that we make publicly available.\nWe also reserve the right to give privileged access to certain categories of our services (such as special API access) or revoke access temporarily or permanently as we see fit, at our sole discretion, and potentially without any advance warning.</p>\n<p>Our moderation services can also be used to moderate your events, including commercial, but please be aware that in the absence of any special agreement beyond this, our moderation services will purely be on an ad hoc \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nFor any special or additional moderation services, please contact us directly.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Fair Play and Community Guidelines, we reserve the right to exclude people from using our services at our sole discretion, and to determine what constitutes abuse of our services, insofar as the relevant licenses and statute allow for.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Creating an account</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Users can optionally choose to register an account with us.\nIn select and special circumstances, a user may have multiple accounts (see our Fairplay &amp.\nCommunity Guidelines for more information).\nAll users who choose to register an account with us must explicitly agree to our privacy policy and other documentation.\nBecause users must also agree to our privacy policy, you must be at least 15 and be the legal age in your jurisdiction to enter into a digital contract (hereafter \u201crelevant legal age\u201d) with us to register an account, or if younger, you must be authorised by your parent or legal guardian.</p>\n<p>Those under the relevant legal age may in some circumstances be allowed to have an account if invited to Lichess by their teacher, parent or legal guardian, who can make \u201ckid accounts\u201d for them.\nIn these circumstances, the teacher or other adult taking the \u201cteacher\u201d role is responsible for securing the relevant consent and permissions for the child to use the account.</p>\n<p>The parents of a child who has signed up via this method are responsible for ensuring that \u201ckid mode\u201d is enforced on the child\u2019s account, which adds additional child-protection measures to that account, such as turning off the ability to see public chats.\nThose under the relevant legal age are assumed to have kid mode enforced by their parents or legal guardian.\nConsequently, Lichess refuses any and all liability for any inappropriate content any user, including those under the relevant legal age, may have been exposed to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When users register for an account, they are asked to choose a username and password.\nThese usernames must comply with our Fair Play and Community Guidelines, namely around inappropriate usernames and impersonation.\nWe reserve the right and sole discretion to determine if a username is inappropriate or if impersonation has occurred - either directly in the account name, or from other profile data.\nBreaching these rules can lead to the suspension of the account from our website and services, and remove your access to the account.</p>\n<p>All activity that happens on the account is the responsibility of the account-holder, consequently you must keep your account secure.\nThis means you must not share your password with anyone.\nTo keep your account more secure, you can also enable two factor authorisation on the account.\nWe recommend everyone, but especially titled or high-profile users, set up two factor authorisation to help keep your account secure.\nIf you forget your password, you can notify us through the \u201cforgotten password\u201d link to have account recovery options emailed to the email address linked to your account.\nYou can find out more about keeping your account secure and how to set up two factor authorisation here.</p>\n<p>If any other person accesses your account, you are solely responsible for all their actions whether or not you authorised, allowed or enabled their access in any way.\nYou agree to indemnify us of any consequences from someone else accessing your account, or of any costs, expenses, claims or damages which arise in connection with a third party using your account.\nIf we reasonably suspect a third party has gained access or control of your account, you further agree and further indemnify us of any costs, expenses, claims or damages relating to any and all actions we take against your account.</p>\n<p>In addition, as fully detailed in the Fair Play and Community Guidelines, you agree that we reserve the right to take any action we see fit against your account, and at our sole discretion can determine if an account has breached our Terms, including our Fair Play and Community Guidelines.</p>\n<p>For more detailed information on the data we collect from registered accounts, as well as enforcing your rights under GDPR or other data protection regimes, please refer to our privacy policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Content on our website (and/or services)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may be able

cases, you may be exposed to content that is mislabelled or is otherwise deceptive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to remove content that violates these Terms, with particular reference to our

us.\nYou affirm and warrant that you have the rights necessary to grant the rights expressed above, and that the uses contemplated in these Terms will not infringe the proprietary or intellectual property rights of any third party.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fair Play and Community Guidelines</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Both registered and anonymous users of our website and services agree to behave with good conduct.\nYou agree that if, at our sole discretion, we determine your account is not behaving with good conduct, you may have your access or use of our website and/or services partially or fully suspended or terminated.\nYou further agree that if, at our sole discretion, we determine your content to have breached these Terms you may have your content partially or fully removed, hidden, deleted or otherwise made inaccessible, either to yourself and/or others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In all circumstances, you agree that we have the right to partially or fully suspend or terminate your access to our website and services (such as banning or closing your account), for any reason without warning, and without having to substantiate, clarify or otherwise provide evidence of your breach of these Terms.\nYou agree that this may include your account being publicly labelled as having violated our Terms if, at our sole discretion, we reasonably believe you to have done so.</p>\n<p>Further and additional information may be found in a relevant documentation page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fair Play Violations:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some examples of poor fair play are provided below.\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and is provided for illustrative reasons only.\nWe reserve the right to take action beyond the examples of bad sportsmanship provided here, and to have sole discretion in determining what constitutes bad sportsmanship.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cheating - We prohibit the use of any external assistance used whilst a game you are involved in is ongoing, which has the effect of improving your knowledge, calculation ability, or otherwise gives you an unfair advantage over your opponent.\nExamples of cheating include, but are not limited to, using a chess engine, opening books, endgame tablebases, and receiving move recommendations from another person or software (including human commenters whilst streaming or social media services), and certain software or extensions at our discretion.\n<br>In correspondence games only, you may use the Lichess opening explorer, plus any other chess books or opening databases.<br>For clarity, these rules have been expressed in the this grid.\n</li>\n<li>Boosting - This is where a rating is artificially inflated, such as by arranging wins in advance with an opponent, or knowingly playing an opponent who is artificially deflating their rating, in an attempt to sandbag.</li>\n<li>Sandbagging - This is where a rating is artificially deflated, such as by resigning early or losing having put no real effort into the game, against an opponent who may be an active and willing participant or a victim.</li>\n<li>Speedruns - Where not covered by any of the other sections, a speedrun (starting from a low rating and trying to increase it as quickly as possible) either being streamed or not, is not currently allowed on Lichess.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Ragesitting, Ragequitting, and Aborting - This is when a player chooses to keep the clock running or leave the game, forcing their opponent to wait for them, rather than playing on or resigning.\nThese are all considered bad sportsmanship, along with aborting too many games too frequently.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Sledging - Whilst linked to the communications section in our Community Guidelines, this is the use of chat, draw offers, move take-back requests, time addition, or challenge to a game offers to intentionally distract or throw off an opponent or player.</li>\n<li>Account sharing - The sharing of accounts is generally not permitted.\nUsers may use a non-shared account for activities like \u201chand and brain\u201d, for streaming or educational purposes, but this must be clear in the account profile description, with names and ratings where relevant, and to opponents (e.g., by accepting viewer challenges, or playing pre-arranged matches rather than general lobby seeks).&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Cheating accusations - The public accusation of a player suspected of cheating is not tolerated, and is bad sportsmanship.\nIf you suspect a user of cheating, please report them via the icon on their profile page, or from the report page</li>\n<li>Ban avoidance - The creation of new accounts to avoid restrictions applied to previous accounts, to avoid the respective bans, without explicit permission from us to make a new account, is not allowed.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Multiple accounts - Having more than one account is not allowed, barring specific circumstances.\nFor example, titled players are automatically entitled to one \u201cpublic\u201d account, for play in certain prize events hosted either by Lichess or another tournament organiser, and one \u201cprivate\u201d account, for casual play online whilst still displaying their titled status.\nUntitled players can create a second account for similar reasons, with some examples including having&nbsp;a private account to hide opening preparation, playing \u201cblindfold\u201d games, or playing games with any other self-imposed impairment.\nCreating an excessive number of accounts (typically any more than three) will generally not be allowed, regardless of reasons.\nCreating and closing multiple accounts will also be treated as contributing to this maximum number.\nAs with all other rules, the specific circumstances where multiple accounts are allowed remain at Lichess\u2019 discretion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Penalties may include, but are not limited to: time outs.\nrankbanning.\nleaderboard bans.\na public mark on the account.\nidentifying the account as violating our Terms.\nclosure of the offending account and any related accounts.\nrevocation of some or all communication privileges.\nhaving access to our website and/or services partially or entirely removed or being in a separate playing pool.\nand IP banning or device banning.\nMultiple penalties may be applied, or any mix or combination at our own discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Community Guideline Violations:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some examples of bad conduct are provided below.\nThis is not an exhaustive list, and is provided for illustrative reasons only.\nWe reserve the right to take action beyond the examples of bad conduct provided here, and to have sole discretion in determining what bad conduct is.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inappropriate communications - These include any private or public chat which makes another person feel distressed or attacked.\nSome non-exhaustive examples are abuse, harassment, spam, public shaming, cheating accusations, extremism, trolling, racism, sexism, or bigotry.\nIn addition to being against our Terms, on some occasions these communications may also amount to unlawful or illegal behaviour and we will cooperate with relevant law enforcement authorities when deemed necessary.<br>You can find more information on chat etiquette, forum etiquette, blog etiquette, and our communication guidelines by following the relevant link.</li>\n<li>Inappropriate usernames - Usernames are public and displayed all over the website, meaning children or vulnerable users may read them.\nA username chosen with the intent of generating negative emotional reactions will be closed.\nThis includes sensitive topics, disparaging usernames, sexism, racism, bigotry, adult language, or usernames otherwise likely to cause harm or offence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Abusing copyrighted material or intellectual property - Examples of these would be the sharing or distribution of chess literature, puzzle sets, annotations, or any other material or intellectual property you do not have the right to share or distribute.\nIf you think your own copyrighted material or intellectual property has been used without permission, please report the user and get in touch with us.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Impersonation - This is when a user pretends to be someone who they are not, including impersonation or implying you have a national or FIDE title.\nThis may be due to a misleading username or other public or private profile information or communications.\nIn some cases, we may ask for ID confirmation to check who you claim to be.</li>\n<li>Abuse of our infrastructure or resources - This includes abuse of our APIs, violating our rules on multiple accounts, abuse of payment features, and any attempts to workaround our protections generally.\nThis also applies to abusing any third party service provider we rely on, or are hosted by.\nPlease contact us if you would like to discuss our protections, including any rate limits.</li>\n<li>Financial crime - Those who donate with stolen credit card or other financial details, or are suspected of donating with stolen credit card or other financial details are absolutely not tolerated.\nWe work closely with our payment providers to spot and prevent this, and take robust action against those violating or suspected of violating this policy, including working with the relevant law enforcement authorities where appropriate on this issue and related (such as proceeds of crime and suspected money laundering).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Breaking into accounts - any kind of activity such as a programmatic approach or social engineering approach to access another user\u2019s account or password is not allowed.\nThis activity is illegal in most circumstances and jurisdictions, and we will cooperate with the relevant law enforcement authorities.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Any volumetric or programmatic attack or exploit (including DOS and DDOS attacks) - it should go without saying that attacking or exploiting our website or services is not allowed.\nThis activity is illegal in most circumstances and jurisdictions, and we will cooperate with the relevant law enforcement authorities.\nPlease report any detected security vulnerabilities to us.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Penalties may include, but are not limited to: rate limits.\nremoval of Patron wings.\ntime

to our website and/or services partially or entirely removed or being in a separate playing pool.\nand IP banning or device banning.\nMultiple penalties may be applied, or any mix or combination at our own discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your right to appeal:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All users publicly marked or restricted from using our website or services have the right to appeal.\nWhen a user appeals, Lichess moderators will look at the relevant information and evidence again.\nThe exact composition of the appeal panel is not set, but includes highly experienced moderators with additional expertise or qualifications in the fields of statistics, computer science, law, and chess (including active titled players FIDE-rated 2400+).</p>\n<p>For general information about appeals, and what you should include in an appeal, you can find out more here.\n</p>\n<p>All Fair Play marks are considered in light of the jurisprudence of the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and whilst we are not bound to them or a signatory to that court, we follow their precedents and required burdens of proof closely.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is important to note that you agree our word is final, and that penalties will be applied at our discretion, and that we have no obligation or duty to provide you with our evidence or reasoning.\nIn some jurisdictions, this will not affect your statutory rights.</p>\n<p>We will never share the reason for a mark with anyone other than the account-holder, without their agreement or without the existence of a contract to which they are a party.\nOutside of the existence of an agreement or a binding contract, we will not share the reason with a coach, friend, parent, arbiter, or the media, nor with a national federation, and neither with FIDE.\nConsequently, because there are multiple reasons for a mark, nobody other than the account holder will ever be entirely sure of why a mark occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Patron</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As a French charitable organisation, which doesn\u2019t believe in advertising or tracking, we\u2019re entirely dependent on donations from our users to stay running.\nYour support is really important to us, and allows us to do more of what we do.</p>\n<p>Users who donate to us are called \u201cpatrons\u201d.\nPatrons are publicly visible on the donation page, and also by receiving an icon on the user\u2019s Lichess profile page which displays the user as a donor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A donation is an entirely voluntary gift, and doesn\u2019t exempt the donor from these Terms or our Fair Play and Community Guidelines.\nDonors do not get a different set of rules to follow, and beyond the visual Patron aesthetic and trophy on their Lichess profile page, unlock no additional features.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A donation to Lichess is a gift.\nIf you donate, you are not getting a share of Lichess, nor does it create a contract between you and Lichess.\nOnce you have donated your gift, you give up your claim on those funds without any expectation of additional services.</p>\n<p>To donate to Lichess, you may need to provide additional details to our payment providers, such as PayPal or Stripe.\nBy donating, we assume you are familiar with the TOS and privacy policies of the payment provider you use, and accept to be bound by their policy documents.</p>\n<p>When donating, please refer to our Fair Play and Community Guidelines, as some practices such as fraudulent payments or using stolen credit cards will result in your account being closed, and may constitute illegal acts, where we will cooperate with the relevant law enforcement authorities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you make a mistake during the donation process, please get in touch with us.\nAlthough refunds are at our discretion, if it\u2019s clear you made a mistake or were double charged (rather than donating and then violating these Terms) we will generally give you a refund if you contact us within 14 days of the donation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ending these Terms and Termination</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may end your legal agreement with us at any time by deactivating your account and no longer

concerned with the protection of the personal data of our users.</p>\n<p>You will find below the LICHESS Privacy Policy - the explanation of our practices and our commitments with regard to the processing of your personal data.</p>\n<p>We implement a process of continuous improvement of our compliance with the general data protection regulations (GDPR) as well as with the law n \u00b0 78-17 of January 6, 1978 known as the \"Data Protection Act\" to ensure the best level of protection to your personal data.\nFor any information on the protection of personal data, you can also consult the website of the National Commission for Computing and Liberties (CNIL) www.cnil.fr.</p>\n<p>Being aware of the importance of clear and transparent information in this area, we have included various tables to help you better understand and exercise your rights.</p> Who is responsible for processing your personal data? <p>\n</p>\n<p>The controller is, within the meaning of the GDPR, the entity that defines for what purpose(s) and how your personal data is used.</p>\n<p>The data controller is Lichess.org, an association governed by the Law of Associations of July 1, 1901, whose head office is located at Mr.\nLucas Bonnet, 9 rue Flachet in Villeurbanne (69100).\nThis means that we are your point of contact for any questions or concerns relating to the collection and use of this data.\nYou can write to us at gdpr@lichess.org.</p>\n<p>LICHESS notably publishes the website https://lichess.org/ which promotes the teaching and practice of chess without advertising.\nUse of the site is also completely free.</p>\n<p>As part of our activities, we may collect and process personal data relating to our users.\nThese different data processing operations are detailed in this Privacy Policy.</p> What data is collected about you and for what reasons? <p>\n</p> 1.\nConnection to the lichess.org site <p>When you connect to the lichess.org site, a certain amount of data is automatically collected by the site host concerning your terminal (such as a computer, smartphone or tablet) and your browser.\nThis particularly includes your IP address.</p>\n<p>This data is collected for the purpose of ensuring the connection between your terminal and the site's servers, as well as to subsequently detect bugs (a bug is a design flaw in a computer program which causes a malfunction) and attempted cyber attacks.</p>\n<p>The collection and processing of this data are thus justified by LICHESS's legitimate interest in providing a functional, secure site suitable for the various types of terminals and browsers on the market, in accordance with article 6.1.f of the GDPR.\n.</p>\n<p> These data are kept for one year following their collection, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of managing the disputes described in point 7.\nbelow.\n</p> 2.\nCreation of an account and management of registered users <p>Information needed to create an account and manage registered users: we collect the information you provided to us when you registered, such as your last name, first name, email address and username.\nIn order to ensure the proper monitoring of our relationship as well as your relationship with other users and to manage the various aspects of these relationships (including competitions and results), we also keep a copy of our written exchanges as well as public messages or those which you exchanged with other users of the site.</p>\n<p>This data processing allows LICHESS to ensure the management of its registered users and is justified by the execution of the contract to which you are a party, namely the LICHESS Terms of Service, in accordance with article 6.1.b of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>These data are kept for the duration of the contract, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of managing the disputes described in point 7.\nbelow.</p>\n<p>Optional information for creating an account and managing registered users: we also collect any optional information you provide to us to complete your profile, such as your FIDE title.</p>\n<p>This data processing is based on your consent, in accordance with Article 6.1.a of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>This data is kept until you withdraw your consent, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of managing disputes described in point 7.\nbelow.</p>\n<p>Session cookies: LICHESS also uses session cookies.\nThese cookies temporarily store the information you have given us and thus allow us to track your movements from one page to another without asking you again for this information to authenticate you.</p>\n<p>This data processing is based on LICHESS's legitimate interest in improving the browsing experience on its site, in accordance with Article 6.1.f of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>These data are kept for the duration of the browsing session.\nYou can configure these cookies from your browser settings.</p> 3.\nTechnical support <p>When you ask us to resolve a technical problem, we collect a certain amount of information such as your name, first name, email address and username, the date and time of your request, as well as the circumstances of the reported problem.</p>\n<p>In addition, it may occur that our moderators need to access your account to see a problem or take an action on your behalf that you have requested.</p>\n<p>This data processing is justified by LICHESS's legitimate interest in offering technical support to its users, in accordance with Article 6.1.f of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>This data is kept until the problem is resolved, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of managing disputes described in point 7.\nbelow.</p> 4.\nImprovement of our services <p>We use data relating to the use of our teaching and chess services to evolve these services in such a way that they are always more effective for our users.</p>\n<p>The data processed for this include navigation data of users on our services.</p>\n<p>This data processing is justified by LICHESS's legitimate interest in developing and improving its services, in accordance with Article 6.1.f of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>We only keep this data for as long as necessary for the analysis allowing us to identify areas for improving our services.</p> 5.\nFraud prevention <p>In order to prevent fraud on our site and in particular the multiplication of accounts, we collect a certain amount of information such as your last name, first name, email address and username.</p>\n<p>This data processing is based on LICHESS's legitimate interest in preventing and combating fraud on its site, in accordance with Article 6.1.f of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>These data are kept for one year following their collection, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of managing the disputes described in point 7.\nbelow.</p> 6.\nDonations and purchases of goods <ul>\n<li>If you donate to our association or purchase goods from our online stores, we will collect your email address, the amount and the transaction number.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This data processing is justified by the execution of the contract, namely the transaction, in accordance with Article 6.1.b of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>This data is kept until full payment is made, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of managing disputes described in point 7.\nbelow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With your consent, we will publish your username and the amount of your donation on our site, in the interests of transparency.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This data processing is based, on your consent, in accordance with Article 6.1.a of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>This data is kept until you withdraw your consent, then for the applicable limitation period for the purposes of managing disputes described in point 7.\nbelow.</p> 7.\nLitigation management (possible or current) <p>We will be likely to keep any data the conservation of which seems necessary or useful to us to prevent a dispute and to manage any litigation or pre-litigation.</p>\n<p>We will use it, where appropriate, to prevent, initiate or respond to a dispute of this type, whether or not you are a party to this dispute (for example a dispute relating to the use of our services).</p>\n<p>This retention is justified by LICHESS's legitimate interest in protecting and defending its rights and interests, including in court, in accordance with Article 6.1.f of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>We will thus keep all relevant data from a probationary point of view for the legally applicable limitation period, i.e.\nin principle 5 years (civil limitation under common law).</p> 8.\nCompliance with a legal obligation <p>We are likely to keep any data the retention of which appears necessary to us to comply with our legal obligations, for the time necessary to comply with these obligations.</p>\n<p>This retention is justified by compliance with a legal obligation to which LICHESS is subject, in accordance with Article 6.1.c of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>We will keep this data for one year, then for the legally applicable limitation period according to the legal obligations concerned.</p> 9.\nFurther processing of data for statistical purposes <p>In order to maintain statistics relating to the games that took place on the lichess.org site and in particular to allow you to know your history of the games played as well as your ranking, we will keep your username and other non-personal information, such as party metadata.</p>\n<p>This further processing is compatible with the initial collection of your username, justified by the execution of the contract in accordance with Article 6.1.b of the GDPR as indicated in point 2 above, in accordance with recital 50 and Articles 5 and 89 of the GDPR.</p> Summary table <p>\n</p> Data collectedPurposes (intended or possible use of data)Justification of the purpose under the GDPRMaximum

mentioned below.\nWe will notify you when a request for erasure does not comply with our legal obligations.</p> Who has access to your data? <p>\n</p>\n<p>Your data is hosted by a secure professional service provider, on servers located in the European Union.\nLICHESS teams, moderators and employees are likely to access it within the framework and the limits of their functions.</p>\n<p>Some of your data may also be viewed or at least hosted by the following people and organizations:</p>\n<p>Technical service providers assisting LICHESS for the maintenance and development of the lichess.org site;</p>\n<p>LICHESS legal advisers, accounting firms and lawyers;</p>\n<p>Chess game database editing services, which aggregate public games;</p>\n<p>Payment service providers and banking establishments used by LICHESS in connection with its collection of donations.</p>\n<p>These providers are all located in the European Union or the United States.\nTransfers made in the United States are done by our subcontractors who are well-known service providers making every effort to offer the appropriate guarantees to supervise these transfers.</p>\n<p>On this point, we are closely following the analyses of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and the CNIL following the recent invalidation of the Privacy Shield, the mechanism which ensured the compliance of data transfers to the United States.</p>\n<p>Regarding your donations that you have authorized us to publish for the sake of transparency, all users can consult them from this table.</p>\n<p>\n</p> What rights do you have to control the processing of your personal data? <p>\n</p>\n<p>You have, like any other person whose personal data we collect and process, a number of rights provided for by the regulations.</p>\n<p>You will find the details below, followed by a summary table.</p>\n<p>You can exercise these rights simply by writing directly to the following email address: gdpr@lichess.org.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Remember to clearly indicate in your e-mail the nature of the right you wish to exercise and the reasons which justify, if applicable, your request to exercise this right.</strong>\n</p> 1.\nRight of access <p>You can ask us for confirmation that personal data concerning you is or is not being processed and, when it is, access to such data.\nYou can access your personal data via this link, by being logged in: https://lichess.org/account/personal-data.</p>\n<p>As such, you have the right to ask us for a copy of the personal data we have about you, in an easily understandable format, as well as a copy of this Policy on a durable medium.</p> 2.\nRight to rectification <p>You can ask us to correct, complete or update the data we have about you, if it seems to you to be inaccurate, incomplete or obsolete.</p>\n<p>In this case, we thank you for kindly communicating to us spontaneously, as far as possible, the new information necessary to proceed to the correction, completion or update requested.</p> 3.\nRight to withdraw consent <p>With regard to processing based on your consent, you can withdraw this consent at any time, without justification.\nWithdrawal of your consent results in the cessation of processing in the future.</p> 4.\nRight of objection <p>Data processing based on the legitimate interest of LICHESS: with regard to the data processing listed above which is justified by the legitimate interests of LICHESS, you have the right to oppose it for reasons relating to your particular situation.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can ask LICHESS to stop one and / or the other of these treatments with regard to you, by setting out the specific reasons which justify this request.</p>\n<p>However, it may happen that LICHESS refuses to respond to your request, if the continuation of this processing is necessary for legitimate and compelling reasons from our point of view (for example: if the data concerned are necessary for the protection and defence of LICHESS's rights in court or for public information reasons).</p>\n<p>Data processed for statistical purposes: with regard to data processing for statistical purposes, you have the right to oppose it for reasons relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a mission of public interest.</p>\n<p>The opposition (if it is based on valid reasons and there is no compelling legitimate reason or the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task of public interest) will result in the termination processing for the future, but not necessarily destruction of the data concerned: to obtain this destruction, you must exercise your right to erasure under the conditions described below, it being specified that the latter is subject to limitations, set out below after.</p> 5.\nRight to erasure <p>You can ask us to delete all or part of the data we have about you, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:</p>\n<p>The data concerned no longer appears necessary for any of the purposes previously explained;</p>\n<p>You have withdrawn your consent in accordance with point 3.\nabove;</p>\n<p>You have objected to the continuation of this processing in accordance with point 4.\nabove, and furthermore want LICHESS to destroy the data concerned;</p>\n<p>You consider that your personal data have been the subject of unlawful processing by LICHESS;</p>\n<p>The data concerned must be erased as a legal obligation;</p>\n<p>The data concerned relates to a person who was younger than fifteen (15) years old when the data was collected.</p>\n<p>Please note, however, that LICHESS is entitled to oppose the deletion of certain data, when their retention is necessary for particularly important reasons, such as the protection and defence of its interests in court.</p>\n<p>In addition, we may choose, instead of deleting the data, to proceed with their complete and irreversible anonymization.\nIn this way, we will be entitled to keep this data in a format that no longer allows you to be identified (for example: for statistical purposes).</p> 6.\nRight to restriction of processing <p>Failing, for example, to exercise your right to erasure, you can also ask LICHESS to \u201cset aside\u201d or \u201cfreeze\u201d certain data concerning you, that is to say to keep this data separately, without using them anymore (except legal obligations).</p>\n<p>You can make such a request when at least one of the following conditions is met:</p>\n<p>The data concerning you appears to be inaccurate to you, and you prefer that LICHESS stops using it, until the data is verified and corrected if necessary.</p>\n<p>You consider that your personal data have been the subject of unlawful processing by LICHESS, but you choose to limit its use rather than delete them;</p>\n<p>The data concerned are no longer necessary for any of the purposes set out above, but you want LICHESS to keep them anyway for the purposes of defending your legal interests;</p>\n<p>You have exercised your right of opposition in accordance with point 4.\nabove, and you prefer that LICHESS cease using the data concerned while it is time to verify the merits of your opposition.</p>\n<p>In these cases, we will \"freeze\" the data for the necessary time, for example by means of a \"Do not use - Right to limitation exercised\" marking.</p> 7.\nRight to data portability <p>You can ask us to send you a copy of the data collected on the basis of
