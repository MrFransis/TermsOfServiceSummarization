sentence.\nThe Beacon transmits information to a server, such as a numeric count, unique identifier, or IP address.\nStitcher and third parties that we contract with use Beacons to help us better manage content on the Stitcher Service, for example, to let us know which emails recipients have opened, or to count the number of unique visitors to a webpage.\nThe use of a Beacon may also allow us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and of our marketing campaigns.\n</p>", "case_id": 217, "document_id": 8467, "quoteStart": 8772, "quoteEnd": 9559}, {"id": 26088, "title":
