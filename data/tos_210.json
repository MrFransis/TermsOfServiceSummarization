Statement <b>Last Updated: December 3, 2020</b>\n<br> See previous Privacy Statements Introduction and overview Intuit leverages technology responsibly to power prosperity around the world, and we believe that everyone has a right to privacy.\nAt Intuit, we view privacy as a key part of the value that we deliver to our customers.\nIntuit\u2019s Data Stewardship Principles were developed to describe Intuit\u2019s values regarding the data our customers entrust to us.\nScope of this Privacy Statement and our role As a financial services and technology company, we\u2019re providing this Global Privacy Statement (which we\u2019ll refer to as \u201cPrivacy Statement\u201d) to explain how we collect, use, and share information when you interact with us and our offerings, services and experiences.\nThis Privacy Statement is global in nature, meaning that it is applicable to all websites and offerings in the Intuit group companies, and it describes our privacy practices when we process:<br>\n<br>a) Personal information for the purposes of preparing a tax return or in connection with the preparation of a tax return (collectively, \u201cTax Preparation Information\u201d) as part of providing TurboTax tax preparation services;<br>\n<br>b) Personal information for the purposes of providing the benefits of the Intuit platform, which is collectively, all of Intuit\u2019s services, sites, experiences and software (including through our mobile applications and desktop applications) by Intuit Inc.\nand its affiliates and subsidiaries other than Tax Preparation Information (the \u201cIntuit Platform\u201d).\nand/or<br>\n<br>c) Personal information as necessary to manage, run and improve our business.<br>\n<br>Intuit Inc.\ndetermines the purposes and means of the processing of personal information (\u201cInformation Controller\u201d).\nIntuit Inc.\nmay share your personal data with other Intuit group companies to process as joint controllers for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.\nIf you have any questions about the processing of your personal data, please contact us in the section \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d below.\n<br>\n<br>This Privacy Statement does not apply where Intuit processes personal information as a service provider on behalf of a customer or entity who acts as the Information Controller, for example, the customers of our professional tax software products.\nWhen we act as a service provider, the privacy statement of the relevant Information Controller and our agreements with such business or entity will govern our processing of personal information.<br>\n<br>In certain circumstances, there may be more than one Information Controller processing your information.\nFor example, your employer or a financial partner may also act as an Information Controller.\nIn these situations, we act as an independent Information Controller over our processing activities \u2013 meaning that we make determinations over how your personal information will be processed independently from the other Information Controller.\nThe other Information Controller may have their own obligations under applicable information privacy law, and you may need to speak with the other Information Controller directly for questions on how they process your personal information.<br> The Intuit Platform The Intuit Platform and your information When we say \u201cplatform\u201d we mean that when you choose to share data with us, or bring over information from third parties (like a bank or loan provider), we use that data together, not just within the individual offering(s) you\u2019re using.\nThis means your bookkeeping details from QuickBooks, budgets from Mint, and recommendations from Credit Karma all live together.\n<br>\n<br>The personal information we use in this centralized way is all the information that Intuit knows about you.\nIt includes your credentials.\nyour name and contact details.\npayment information.\ninformation about your activities, your interests and preferences.\ninsights about your finances or your business.\nthe content you place in our Platform.\nand information we have collected about you from third-party sources.<br> Organizational account information Some experiences and services within the Intuit Platform allow you to interact with an organization (such as your employer).\nIf you are granted access to an organization or household account (for example, a business's account in QuickBooks), the owner of the organization or a designated administrator may control and administer details of your account, for example, by deciding your access rights.\nmaking decisions about your personal information (such as details about your payroll).\nor requiring you to take certain actions (for example, use location tracking to clock in for a shift).\nIf your access rights are amended by the owner or designated administrator, then you may lose access to the information that is in the control of the organization.<br>\n<br>Your use of the Intuit Platform as part of an organization\u2019s account may be subject to the organization\u2019s policies, which may be different from this Statement.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other organizations, and you should consider both the organization's policies and whether you are comfortable enabling the organization with access to your information prior to connecting to their services.\nInformation we collect Information we receive from you The personal information that we receive about you depends on the context of your interactions with Intuit, how you configure your account and the choices that you make, including your privacy settings.\nPersonal information that you provide may also depend upon what services or experiences you use, your location and applicable law.\nLearn more about the personal information we collect, how we use it, and your

about any links with which you interact.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\n<b>Location information.</b> Certain features in the Intuit Platform may collect your precise location information, device motion

experiences you request, recognize your visit, track your interactions, and improve your and other customers' experience.\nYou have control over some of the information we collect from Cookies and how we use it.\nFor full details on how we use cookies and similar technologies please see our Intuit Cookies Policy.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\n<b>Information stored locally.</b> Some of our web-enabled

your organizational account manager\u2019s last interaction with Intuit, whichever comes first.\nInformation provided by others Our platform is designed to help you connect with other people and organizations.\nAs a result of those connections, others may be able to input information about you.\nFor example, your employer may input information about your salary and work activity in order to process their payroll.\nYou may also be able to input or process information about others, for example, if you are an account administrator.\nIf you input information about others into our platform, you must only do so if you have first received the appropriate rights and permissions to do so, including by getting advanced written consent, if required by applicable law.\nOther information sources We may also get information about you from others where permitted by applicable law.\nWe protect and process information obtained from those parties as described in this Privacy Statement, consistent with any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the information.\nOur sources may vary over time and depend upon how you use the Intuit Platform.\nFor example, we receive information
