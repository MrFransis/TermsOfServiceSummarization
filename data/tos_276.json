the Platform, who may view your profile information, listen to and comment on any of your public Sounds, add themselves to your list of followers, and send you messages.\nCreators will be able to see in their statistics that you have listened to the tracks they uploaded.\nThey will also be able to see how many times you have listened to any of their Sounds, and that you are following them.\nThis is to allow creators to track the popularity of their Sounds.\nSimilarly, if you comment on any Sounds on the Platform, your comments will be available to all users of the Platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>With Your Consent</strong> \u2013 We will disclose your information if you have agreed that we may do so.\nWe will make this clear to you at the point at which we collect your information, including the purpose(s) for which we will use the data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Providers</strong> \u2013 We use a variety of service providers, some of who may be located outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), to provide services to us or to our users on our behalf.\nThese service providers have access to your information solely to

only to process personal data in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to provide their services to us.\nWe need to share your information, including personal information, in

your data on our behalf under special conditions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Content Partners</strong> \u2013 The Platform allows you to listen to a variety of audio content, including licensed streaming content from our commercial content partners.\nWe share information with these content partners that license this content to us to help them understand how the content they provide is performing, including insights about general user listening trends and preferences.\nWe use technical measures to ensure the data is de-identified and/or aggregated so it does not identify you directly.\nWe share this data based on our legitimate interest in helping content partners deliver high performing content and to ensure the fulfillment of our contract with those partners.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising</strong> \u2013 We share the data collected about you, generally in hashed, aggregated, or de-identified forms with advertisers and advertising

a detailed overview of our advertisers here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media</strong> \u2013 For users outside of the EU/EEA, where permissible under applicable law, or with your explicit consent, we may share your email address (in hashed form, so that it does not identify you) with Facebook in order to target you with ads for SoundCloud products on Facebook and on third party websites and applications in the Facebook Audience Network.\nWe also allow Facebook and other social media platforms to collect information through cookies and similar technologies like pixels in order to serve ads for SoundCloud on those third party websites and apps and drive users to our Platform.\nIn order to measure the effectiveness of and optimize these marketing campaigns, these technologies track activity taken across devices after a user sees a SoundCloud ad, in order to determine performance metrics like sign ups, visits to the Platform, and purchases.\nWe undertake these activities based on our legitimate interest in acquiring new customers and offering products we think you may be interested in.\nAny questions regarding how these social media platform service provider processes your personal data should be directed to such third party platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregated Data</strong> \u2013 We may also share aggregated information (information about our users that we render in such a way that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other pseudonymised information for regulatory compliance, industry and market analysis, demographic profiling, marketing and advertising, and other business purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>API Integrations</strong> \u2013 SoundCloud has an open application-programming interface (API), which enables application developers to integrate elements of the Platform into other apps.\nSome of these developers may be located outside of the EEA.\nAny

bear this in mind when deciding what information to publish on your profile.\nFor information on how to limit the information that is available through the API, please see the Your Choices and Controls section below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Applications</strong> \u2013 If you choose to connect your SoundCloud account to other apps or social networks such as Facebook you

connected apps, you will need to provide the app developer with full access to your SoundCloud\u00ae account in order to upload and download Sounds, or comment on, favorite, or repost Sounds from within the app.\nThis means sharing your public information, plus access to your private Sounds.\nSoundCloud is not responsible for these other apps or networks, so please make sure you only connect your account with apps or services that you trust.\nFor information on how to control the information that you share, and how to disconnect your account from these apps, please see the Your Choices

and freedoms of natural persons that may be involved with our processing operations.\nWe regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks.\nHowever, it is not possible to guarantee the security of information transmitted over the Internet.\nYou use the Platform and provide us with information at your own discretion and risk.</p>\nInternational Data Transfers\n<p>SoundCloud operates globally and may share your information internally within the SoundCloud Group, and third parties for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nInformation collected within the EEA may, for example, be transferred to countries outside of the EEA for the purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.\nWe utilize appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, or another legally approved mechanism, to ensure the lawful transfer of your personal data outside of the EEA.\nThe Standard Contractual

as the case may be, or allow them to register an account.\nIf it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 16 or 13, as applicable, we will delete this information as quickly as possible.\nIf you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such personal data, please notify us immediately at dataprotection@soundcloud.com.</p>\nYour Choices and Controls\n<p>We do our best to give you as much choice as possible regarding the amount of information you provide to us, and the control you have over that information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing SoundCloud Settings</strong>.\nIf you register an account, you may manage the content and information you share when you use SoundCloud through your account Settings, including for the features explained below.\nYou are solely responsible for keeping your Settings up-to-date.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Email</strong> \u2013 You can adjust your Settings in the Notification tab to disable email and desktop notifications (other than important service updates and essential notifications about the Platform or your account).\nAll commercial emails and newsletters also allow you to unsubscribe at any time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics</strong> \u2013 To control whether we collect analytics and usage information, including through cookies and similar technologies, you can adjust your Settings in the \u201cAnalytics\u201d tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Marketing</strong> \u2013 If you do not want to receive personalized ads, offers or other marketing messages for SoundCloud products or services, you can adjust your Settings in the \u201cCommunications\u201d tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising</strong> \u2013 If you do not want SoundCloud to deliver \u201cinterest based\u201d or personalized ads for third party products, you can adjust your Settings in the \u201cAdvertising\u201d tab.\nPlease note, however, that even if you opt out of personalized ads, you may still see ads, but they will likely not be as relevant or useful to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Content Sharing</strong> \u2013 It\u2019s not possible to make your account entirely private.\nHowever, you do have the option to make all of your tracks, playlists and other uploads private.\nThis means that no one will be able to access and listen to your Sounds without your explicit permission.\nYou can learn more about these settings here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Apps</strong> \u2013 If you have chosen to connect your account to a third-party application, like Facebook or Google, you can disable permission for the app by adjusting your Settings in the \u201cConnections\u201d tab.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Developers</strong> \u2013 SoundCloud has an open API, which allows third party developers to build some really cool apps as an extension of the Platform.\nIf you would prefer that your Sounds are not made available to third party app developers, you can disable API access within the sound page for each of the Sounds that you upload.\nClick on the pencil icon in the waveform player, and uncheck the \u201cApps enabled\u201d box at the bottom of the page.\nPlease note that your public profile information will still be accessible, but this does not include anything that is not publicly available on the Website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Deleting Your Account</strong> \u2013 If you have an account and would like to delete it, you may do so by adjusting you Settings in the Account tab.\nIf you delete your account, all data associated with your account (except for backup copies), including the Sounds that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those Sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable.\nWe therefore advise you to copy or backup all content uploaded to your account before deletion.\nEven if you delete your SoundCloud account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages.\nSearch engines\u2019 caching processes are outside of SoundCloud\u2019s control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.\nPlease note that deleting any SoundCloud Apps, or any third party apps to which your SoundCloud account is connected, will not delete your SoundCloud account.\nSimilarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your SoundCloud account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data about your SoundCloud activity from within that third party app.\nYou will need to refer to the app provider\u2019s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete data about your SoundCloud activity from that third party app.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing Device Settings</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On your mobile device, enable the \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d setting in your iOS phone\u2019s settings, or the setting to \u201cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u201d in your Android phone\u2019s settings.\nTo opt-out of location tracking when using our Apps, you can use the settings of your device.\nYou can disable mobile analytics and bug reporting through these same settings as well.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing Browser Settings</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To control cookies, you can modify your settings in most web browsers to accept or deny cookies or to request your permission each time a site attempts to set a cookie.\nYou can also manually delete previously stored cookies at any time.\nPlease note that if you choose to block cookies, doing so may impair the Platform or prevent certain elements of it from functioning.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional Choices and Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For more information about analytics and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s opt-out page, the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s opt-out page, or http://youronlinechoices.eu.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nExercising Your EU Privacy Rights\n<p>If you are a user residing in the EU/EEA, you may exercise any of the rights described in this section through the Help Center or by contacting us at dataprotection@soundcloud.com.\nPlease note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Access and Portability</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may be entitled to request copies of your personal information held by us.\nWhile a lot of the personal information you provide to us can be accessed in your account Settings, you may also be entitled to request copies of personal information you have provided to us in machine-readable format.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Change or Correct Data</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you cannot update data yourself through an account, you have the right to ask us to correct, change, update or rectify your data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Retention and Deletion</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We generally retain data for as long as is necessary to provide services to you under your account or, for as long as is necessary to provide the Platform to you as a registered or unregistered user.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have the right to ask us to delete all or some of the personal data we hold about you.\nIf you have an account, you can also delete your account through the Settings at any time as described below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may need to retain some of your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (e.g.\nunder applicable tax or commercial law or to prevent fraud and abuse and maintain and enhance security).\nAfterwards, we delete the data immediately, unless we need the data until the expiry of the statutory period of limitation for the purpose of providing evidence for civil law claims or because of statutory storage obligations (e.g.\nfor accounting reasons).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Objection to Processing</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>You have the right to object to processing your personal information on grounds relating your particular situation at any time (in particular, where we don\u2019t have to process the information to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the information on the basis of our legitimate interests).</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>If you object to such processing SoundCloud will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or obligations.</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to such processing of your personal data at any time and ask SoundCloud to cease processing your data for these direct marketing purposes.</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Restriction of Processing</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to limit the ways in which we use your personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Withdrawing Consent</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you provide consent to the processing of your personal information by SoundCloud, you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your account Settings or by sending a communication to SoundCloud specifying the specific consent you are withdrawing.\nPlease note that the withdrawal of your consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing activities based on such consent before its withdrawal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Lodging Complaints</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have the right to lodge complaints about the data processing activities carried out by SoundCloud before a competent data protection authority.\nA list of EU data protection authorities is available at http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=612080.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nNotice To California Users\n<p>Pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018

empowered but also respected.\nIt\u2019s up to all of us to make that happen.\nThis page includes important information about our rules and guidelines related to your use of SoundCloud.\nPlease take the time to carefully read through this information.\nwe take these guidelines seriously and expect you to do the same.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;The examples in the below sections are for illustrative purposes and are not exhaustive.\nSoundCloud reserves the right to remove any content deemed to violate our Terms of Use at our discretion.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"copyright\"&gt;Copyright&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We have always set out to build a diverse, collaborative community where the rights of creators are respected.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;You are responsible for all activity associated with your account, including all content that you post.\nIf you post content that belongs to someone else (for example, if you are a distributor, promotional agency, manager, or radio plugger acting on behalf of an artist or label), or if you use someone else\u2019s content in a remix or other similar work, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have the permission of all relevant rightsholders in order to post that content to SoundCloud.\nAnyone uploading another person\u2019s content without the necessary permissions is liable to have that content removed and/or their account terminated.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;When reporting content for infringement, we consider reports abusive if you are not the rightsholder or an authorized agent thereof (like the rightsholder\u2019s attorney or manager).\nAbusive reporting may result in your civil liability for damages incurred by SoundCloud (including costs and legal fees), the person whose content you report, or any copyright owner or authorized licensee as a result of content being removed.\nAdditionally, you risk having your account frozen or, in some cases, terminated if we believe that you have abusively reported content.\nIf you do not own the copyright in the content, please do not report it for infringement.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;If you are unsure whether you can upload something, read our &lt;a href=\"/pages/copyright\"&gt;copyright information pages&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you feel that someone is infringing your copyright, &lt;a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/pages/copyright/report/form\"&gt;tell us about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"enforcement-guidelines\"&gt;Enforcement guidelines&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;SoundCloud gives people from all over the world the power to share and connect through music and audio and is the only global community where you can connect one on one with fellow fans, the biggest names in music and emerging artists.\nWhile engaging with the community can be rewarding, it can also be a source of frustration and misunderstanding if the context of the content is not considered or understood or users don\u2019t communicate and interact in a respectful way.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;As a general rule we\u2019re unable to prescreen or proactively search for many kinds of content, but we aim to be fair in deciding what content is permitted on SoundCloud.\nWhile complaints and inquiries must be evaluated and addressed on a case-by-case basis, we aim to apply a uniform set of standards to every user.\nWhen determining whether to remove content, we ask ourselves a number of questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Is the behavior directed at an individual, group, or protected category of people?&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Clearly targeted content will increase likelihood of removal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Has the report been filed by the target of the abuse or a third party?&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;In some instances we may not be able to take reports from third parties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Does the reported user have a history of violating our policies?&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;If a user has violated our Terms of Use in the past, this could impact the decision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;How severe is the violation?&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;The severity will be reflected in the respective action (i.e.\nwarning vs.\nsuspension).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Is the content of legitimate public interest?&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;The purpose of content will be considered.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;When you see content that upsets or shocks you, step back and consider the above in addition to the possible context and intention of the person sharing the content.\nIf you\u2019re unsure of a user\u2019s intentions, feel free to engage with them in a calm and level-headed manner.\nThe comments section on SoundCloud provides a unique environment for people to engage in a conversation around the content.\nAlternatively, you could message the user privately to share any concerns.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, it\u2019s always possible to block or ignore a user as a means to no longer see unwanted content on SoundCloud, and sometimes this is the best or only way to resolve these issues.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Please consider the above and review the relevant section of our Community Guidelines below before reporting content to our Trust and Safety Team.\nThis will both align your expectations with our policy and allow our team to focus on removing content that truly doesn\u2019t have a place on SoundCloud.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"criticism\"&gt;Criticism&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Criticism should always focus on the content, and not on the individual who created it.\nWe do not want criticism of the personal character of the creator, only the criticism of their content.\nPlease share your opinion with others, but do so in a constructive way.\nBefore posting feedback, always ask yourself whether you would appreciate receiving the same feedback.\nIf not, don\u2019t post it.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;\u201cThis wasn't my favorite track of

id=\"harassment\"&gt;Harassment&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We define harassment as the unwanted, continued pursuit of contact with an individual who has indicated they do not wish to be in contact with another individual.\nThe difference between abuse and harassment is that harassment is typically conducted over a sustained period of time, whereas abuse may be a one-off event.\nTherefore, if an individual is sending repeated unwanted messages or comments to another user, they risk the immediate, permanent termination of their account.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Message or comment once: \u201cHey, you should check out my music, I think you\u2019d like it\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly message or comment: \u201chey I think you\u2019re beautiful talk to me!\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Engage with someone when they\u2019ve told you to stop, or use SoundCloud to contact someone when they\u2019ve blocked you on another platform.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Create accounts or content with the sole purpose of \u201cexposing\u201d the behavior of a single identifiable individual or group of individuals.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"unauthorized-recording-or-publishing-of-private-information\"&gt;Unauthorized recording or publishing of private information&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We

this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Include personal details such as \u201cSarah Smith at Elmwood High School\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use photos of other individuals without their consent.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Upload recordings of private phone calls between two individuals without consent.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use screenshots of private conversations as

misleading.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;This means that you must not create profiles or post content that is intended to make people think you are someone else.\nYou must not use someone else\u2019s name or trademark without their permission, or pretend to be associated with someone you aren\u2019t, even if you feel that you are helping that person by doing so.\nThis applies to everyone from the most popular creators to casual users on SoundCloud.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use tags to indicate similarities to artists that inspire you.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use your own name as a display name or URL where this is also the name of an existing artist and no \u2122 infringement is taking place.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use your own

banner, track or playlist image where the artist is not officially associated with the account or track.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;List artist names in your bio as a means of attempting to game our

images containing nudity and recordings or detailed descriptions of sexual acts, or links to pornographic sites.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Post ASMR of your dog eating treats, or you brushing your hair.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do

wider public.\nAdditionally, the use of excessive gore in regards to both imagery or language is not permitted.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Provide commentary on violence in regards to a specific event (i.e.\nsomething that happened to you in the context of a podcast

necessary to determine if beliefs or opinions incite hatred.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that applicable laws state that Nazi and ISIS content is illegal, and will be removed without

id=\"podcasts\"&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We understand that SoundCloud is a popular platform to host podcasts, and we welcome those who chose to use our platform for that reason.\nWe invite the discussion and expression of our users opinions on almost all given topics.\nWith that being said, we reserve the right to decide when those discussions, expressions and opinions are aimed at harming a group of individuals, or when they cross over into hate speech or abuse.\nIn these instances, users risk deletion of certain episodes or suspension of their account.\nWe also do not allow podcasts associated with any illegal or hate groups, even when the content itself does not violate our Terms of Use.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Host a podcast about your favorite foods.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Host a historical podcast.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Dedicate your entire podcast or a section of your podcast to \u201cissues with\u201d or reasons you dislike a protected

News&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;As a platform that promotes freedom of speech and connects millions of people, we feel we have a responsibility to take a clear stance on the issues of fake news and misinformation.\nAlthough not a new concept, the digital age has made it easier than ever to spread information almost anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;With that being said, we understand that in today\u2019s day and age many people rely on the internet and social platforms as their main news source.\nTherefore, in order to maintain the trust and safety of our community, the deliberate use of false information in order to mislead users is something we do not condone.\nThis type of information can take many forms, but is often uploaded with the aim of affecting political discourse.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to ensure the accuracy of your content, as each user is responsible for what they upload.\nAny user found to be purposely sharing information that is fabricated or misleading may be deemed in violation of our Terms of Use and subject to the immediate, permanent termination of their account.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use imaginative subjects to produce satire, comedy and entertainment content.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;State the sources of information shared when presenting content as news.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Use of clickbait titles, profile names and description.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Fabricate content that deliberately presents false or misleading claims as news.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Refer to violent events as \u201cfalse flags\u201d&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Post links to websites hosting \u2018fake news\u2019 articles or false information.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"spammy-behavior-and-self-promotion\"&gt;Spammy behavior and self promotion&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;SoundCloud aims to help creators to connect directly with their fans and build their audience.\nWe understand that promoting your work is important, and we encourage you to seek out fans and other like-minded individuals.\nIn our experience, the most successful forms of promotion are built upon meaningful interactions between creators and their audience.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;However, there is a fine line between developing these connections and over-sharing with members of the community.\nTo help encourage a two-way relationship between creators and fans, we have technical restrictions in place to limit activity that goes against this principle.\nFurther, we aim for SoundCloud to be a spam-free zone.\nTo support this effort, we have policies in place that prohibit both spammy activity and the use of related services that violate our Terms of Use.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Specifically, it is not possible to:&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Post identical or almost identical comments or messages in large volumes&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly follow large volumes of accounts in a short period of time&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly unfollow and refollow the same accounts, in order to draw attention to your own profile&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Repeatedly repost or like tracks that you have reposted or liked in the past&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Reach out to fans with tailored messages for each one of them.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Find users related to your content and interact with them.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Repost tracks similar to your own to attract traffic.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't do this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;ul&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Copy and paste the same links and words in comments and/or private chat.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Randomly bulk follow a large amount of users.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Pay for external promotion services not affiliated with SoundCloud.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Creation, use or promotion of services that claim to boost a profile\u2019s popularity such as followers, plays, likes, or reposts.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Creation, use or promotion of services that sell social interactions or other forms of promotion on SoundCloud.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;li&gt;Create multiple accounts with the intention of inflating the popularity of other profiles.&lt;/li&gt.\n&lt;/ul&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"reporting-violations\"&gt;Reporting violations&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;We aim to create and foster a community where our users\u2019 behavior is in line with these guidelines and where individuals hold each other accountable for their use of the platform.\nWhen this fails, we also have various measures in place to help us keep track of certain kinds of content that violate our Terms of Use.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;As a general rule we\u2019re unable to prescreen or proactively search for many kinds of content.\nAs such, it\u2019s possible you might come across content that you don\u2019t wish to see.\nIn these cases, please ignore such content and block those who share it to avoid it in the future.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;That said, if you encounter any content that clearly violates these guidelines or our Terms of Use or is otherwise illegal \u2013 including impersonation, abusive or threatening behavior, pornography or malicious speech \u2013 please report this.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;Our Trust and Safety Team will review all reports objectively, and remove any content that violates our Terms of Use, these guidelines or applicable law.\nTo report content

in mind that something you find unacceptable, may not be a violation of our Terms of Use or illegal.\nWe try to maintain a fair and balanced approach, but reporting content will not always result in that content being removed if it does not violate our guidelines, Terms of Use or applicable law.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;h2 id=\"termination-of-accounts\"&gt;Termination of accounts&lt;/h2&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;If we

account.\nIf we send you more than two of these warnings, we may suspend or terminate your account in our discretion.&lt;/p&gt.\n&lt;p&gt;In certain cases, such as when we deem your account to be

may change the prices charged for any of its Subscriptions from time to time.\nIn the event of any increase in the price or material reduction in the features of any Subscription which you have purchased, such change(s) will be communicated to you and will only take effect with respect to any subsequent renewal of your subscription.\nIn all other cases, where SoundCloud proposes to make changes to any type of Subscription you have purchased, and these changes are material and to your disadvantage, SoundCloud will notify you of the proposed changes by sending a message to your SoundCloud\u00ae account and/or an email to the then current email address that we have for your account, at least six (6) weeks in advance.\nYou will have no obligation to continue using the Platform following any such notification, but if you do not terminate your account as described in the &lt;a href=\"#termination\"&gt;Termination&lt;/a&gt.\nsection below during such six (6) week period, your
