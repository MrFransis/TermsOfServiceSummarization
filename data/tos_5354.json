or accessed from your web browser or your computer's hard drive.\nA cookie typically contains the name of the domain (internet location) from which the cookie originated, the \"lifetime\" of the cookie (i.e., when it expires) and a randomly generated unique number or similar identifier.\nA cookie also may contain information about your computer, such as user settings, browsing history and activities conducted while using the Services.\nA web beacon (also called a pixel tag or clear GIF) is a piece of computer code that enables us to monitor user activity and website traffic.\nTo learn more about cookies and web beacons, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>\n<p>How We Use Data Collection Technology: Data Collection Technology helps us improve your experience of the Services by, for example, storing your website language preferences, so you do not have to select it each time you use the Services, compiling statistics about use of the Services, helping us analyze technical and navigational information about the Services, and detecting and preventing fraud.</p>\n<p>The Services use the following cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strictly necessary cookies, which are required for the

you when a cookie is placed on your Device.\nYou also may be able to reject Device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your Device.\nAlthough you are not required to accept cookies or mobile device identifiers, if you block or reject them, you may not have access to all features available through the Services.</p>\n<p>Our Statement On Do Not Track Signals: Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a \"Do Not Track\" (\"<strong>DNT</strong>\") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.\nIf a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain personal data about the browser\u2019s user.\nNot all browsers offer a DNT option, and DNT signals are not yet uniform.\nFor this reason, many website operators, including MiniTool, do not respond to DNT signals.</p> How We Process Personal Data <p>MiniTool processes personal data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To set up and maintain your account;</li>\n<li>To communicate with you;</li>\n<li>To prevent and
