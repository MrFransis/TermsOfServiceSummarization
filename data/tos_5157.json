binding from the time Domainnameshop receives the application.\nDomain name registration is a service which is considered to be delivered in full at the time of registration, and as such the Norwegian <i>Act on the right to repent a sale of goods after a cooling-off period (Angrerettloven)</i> which gives the customer 14 days to regret and cancel consumer purchases done through phone, mail or the Internet, does not apply.\nAs soon as the domain name application is sent from Domainnameshop to the Registry Operator, the application cannot be cancelled, and the registration fee must be paid in full.\nThis also applies if you should change your mind and do not want to register the domain or if you want to cancel the domain before the end of the registration term.\nAll registration fees and renewal fees are non-refundable.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Eligibility requirements:</b>\nDifferent TLDs have different eligibility requirements, and you warrant that the domain name applicant meets

Area, and domain names under .no can only be registered by Norwegian organizations and private individuals resident in Norway.\nFor a complete list of eligibility requirements, please refer to the Registry Operator's policies for each TLD (see Appendix 1).</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Third party rights:</b>\nWhen submitting a domain name application, you are solely responsible for ensuring that neither the domain name itself nor the manner in which it is directly or indirectly used violates or infringes in any ways the rights, including trademark rights, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of any third party.\nDomainnameshop recommends that you undertake the necessary research, including a trademark search, to ensure that a successful registration will not not violate or infringe any third party rights, before submitting the application.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Required information:</b> You agree to provide Domainnameshop with the following contact information for each domain name application: (1) the full name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and (where available) fax number of the Registered Name Holder, (2), the name of an authorized

the Registered Name holder is an organization, association or corporation) or a birth date or national identification number (if the Registered Name Holder is an individual).\nIn addition, you must provide the primary nameserver and secondary nameserver(s) for the domain name.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Registered Name Holder:</b> The Registered Name Holder (\"domain holder\", \"holder\" or \"registrant\") means the person or legal entity who is the holder of a registered domain name, as specified in the contact information for the domain name.\nIf you are the Registered Name Holder, you understand and accept that Domainnameshop in capacity as registrar for your domain will act on your behalf towards the Registry Operator in all matters concerning registration, renewal and maintenance of your domain.\nIf you yourself are not the Registered Name Holder, but are ordering or paying for services or otherwise controls the management of the domain name on behalf of the Registered Name Holder, then you acknowledge and warrant that you have obtained the Registered Name Holder's explicit permission to act on its behalf and enter into this Agreement, and that the Registered Name Holder has been informed of all relevant parts of this Agreement pertaining to its domain name registration.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Account Holder:</b> The Account Holder means the person or legal entity who controls the username and password for managing the domain name in Domainnameshop's control panel at https://domainnameshop.com/login.\nIf you are the registrant of the domain, you authorize that the Account Holder may update nameservers, DNSSEC parameters, contact information and all other domain name data on your behalf.\nYou understand that this authorization can only be revoked for as long as you are still listed as the registrant in the domain name record.\nYou further agree to release, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Domainnameshop against any claims, losses, and liabilities arising out of any dispute between you and the Account Holder.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>License of use:</b> A Registered Name Holder that intends to license use of a domain name to a third party is nonetheless the Registered Name Holder of record and is responsible for providing its own full contact information and for providing and updating accurate technical and administrative contact information adequate to facilitate timely resolution of any problems that arise in connection with the domain name.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Accuracy of registration data:</b> You agree to provide Domainnameshop with accurate and reliable contact details and to correct and update them within 7 (seven) days of any change during the term of the domain name registration.\nIf you intentionally provide inaccurate or unreliable information, fail to update the information within 7 (seven) days of any change, or fail to respond over 15 (fifteen) days to Domainnameshop's inquiries about the accuracy of the contact details, this shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and be a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name registration.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Data processing and publication:</b>\nYou understand and consent to that Domainnameshop may store and process the contact data you provide under \"Required Information\" above and share this information with Registry Operators and law-enforcement authorities for the purpose of identifying and contacting the Registered Name Holder, administrative or technical contact in the event of a domain name dispute, suspicion of unlawful activities, technical problem or other urgent issue relating to the domain.\nYou may access and update the contact data at any time from the control panel at https://domainnameshop.com/login.\nDomainnameshop agrees that we will not process the contact data in a way that is incompatible with the purposes set forth above, and that we will take reasonable precautions to protect contact data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.\nIf you provide contact data on any third party person who has not entered into this Agreement, you represent that this person has been informed about and consented to the data processing principles outlined above.\nYou further agree that the following information may be made publicly available on the Internet via WHOIS (e.g.\nhttps://domainnameshop.com/whois) and other means: (1) the domain name registered.\n(2) the name, postal address, email address, and telephone and fax numbers for the registrant and contact persons for the domain (if required by the WHOIS policy for the TLD).\n(3) the hostnames and IP addresses of the nameservers for the domain, and, (4) the date of registration, date of last modification and expected expiration date.\nFor details on which data elements that are published in WHOIS, please refer to the WHOIS policy for each TLD (see list in Appendix 1).\nFor more detailed information regarding processing and publishing of personal data, please refer to our Privacy Policy.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Dispute resolution:</b>\nYou agree to be bound by the appropriate domain dispute resolution policy (\"Dispute Policy\") applicable to the domain that you have selected.\nThe Dispute Policies are hereby incorporated and made a part of this Agreement by reference (see Appendix 1).\nCertain disputes, as specified in the applicable Dispute Policy, are subject to that Policy.\nIn the event such dispute arises, you agree that you will be subject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy in effect at the time your domain registration is disputed by a third party.\nThe Dispute Policy may be modified at any time by the applicable Registry Operator(s) and your continued use of the domain registered to you after any such Dispute Policy modification shall constitute your acceptance of the modified Dispute Policy.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Right to refuse or cancel registration:</b>\nDomainnameshop reserves the right to reject your domain name application for any reason it may see fit, for example in case of suspicion of inaccurate information provided by you, suspicion that the domain will be used for any unlawful purpose, or if Domainnameshop has doubts about your credibility or solvency.\nYou also agree that a successful domain name registration may later be subject to suspension, cancellation or transfer (1) if an ICANN adopted specification or policy requires it, (2) to correct mistakes by Domainnameshop or the Registry Operator in registering the domain name, or (3) for the resolution of disputes concerning the registered domain name.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Submission of application does not guarantee registration:</b>\nA successfully submitted domain name application to Domainnameshop is no guarantee that the domain can actually be registered.\nThe domain may be reserved or prohibited to register, it may be registered by someone else, the application may be incomplete, there may be technical errors (for example incorrect configuration of nameservers), or other errors that prevent the domain from being registered.\nAs a registrar, Domainnameshop's responibility is restricted to forwarding the application from you to the Registry Operator for the TLD in question and communicate the result of the registration request from the Registry Operator back to you.\nDomainnameshop shall not be held liable for any possible errors or inaccuracies related to the submission of the application to the Registry Operator, whether caused by you, by Domainnameshop or by the Registry Operator.\nApplications are normally forwarded promptly from Domainnameshop to the Registry Operator, but no guarantee about this is given.\nPlease note that it may happen that a domain name is available at the time you submit your application to Domainnameshop, but not at the time Domainnameshop forwards the application to the Registry Operator.\nDomainnameshop strongly discourages that you start using the domain name on material for commercial purposes, business cards etc., before you have received a confirmation from Domainnameshop that the domain has been successfully registered.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Renewal and expiration of domain:</b>\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring that any and all domains and additional services are renewed prior to their expiration date, should you so desire their

the service.\nDomainnameshop will not be liable for any inconvenience this may cause you to properly transfer your domain.\nYou are solely responsible for a failure to transfer the domain, and Domainnameshop shall not be liable for such a failure.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Domain authorization code (AUTHINFO):</b> You agree that Domainnameshop may set an authorization code (AUTHINFO) for your domain with the Registry Operator, to protect your domain from unauthorized transfers.\nYou also agree that Domainnameshop may change the authorization code periodically, and that Domainnameshop

through the control panel, your domain will be \"parked\" with Domainnameshop, i.e.\nInternet users that type in your domain in a web browser will be redirected to a Parking Page.\nBy using Domainnameshop's nameservers, you hereby consent to and authorize Domainnameshop's placement of a Parking Page on your parked domain.\nIn the event that your domain registration expires and is not renewed on time, you also authorize Domainnameshop to change the nameservers for your domain and redirect it to a Parking Page.\nYou may change the nameservers back again (or \"un-park\" the domain) after the renewal is complete.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Pre-orders:</b>\nThe following additional terms and conditions contained in this section apply where you authorize and direct Domainnameshop to attempt to register a domain name if and when the applicable Registry Operator launches a new TLD, a new domain policy, or a new service (\"Pre-Order\").\nBy Pre-Ordering a domain registration, you understand and agree that Domainnameshop shall make a good faith effort to contact the applicable Registry Operator and to register the selected domain name on your behalf, as soon as practicable

or sunrise periods, including, but not limited to, the ability to set WHOIS contact information, nameservers or transfer lock status.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Domainnameshop shall have no liability for any such restrictions or limitations on use.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Premium domain names:</b> Some Registry Operators have implemented tiered pricing, where certain domain names are categorized as \"premium names\" and may only be registered and/or renewed at a higher price than the standard price.\nYou understand and acknowledge that the price list on https://domainnameshop.com/pricelist only displays standard prices.\nDomainnameshop will attempt to check with the Registry Operator if a domain has a premium price before displaying the search results, but we give no guarantees that the domain can actually be registered/renewed at the listed price.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs):</b>\nWhen registrering a domain name containing non-ASCII characters, so-called IDNs (Internationalized Domain Names), it is your responsibility to ensure that any users who wish to access the domain have the necessary

order which we receive the Declarations, not the actual applications.\nYou acknowledge that Domainnameshop may choose to reject the Applicant's Declaration if we suspect that the person who has signed the Declaration is not the person specified in the application, or is not authorized to sign documents on behalf of the entity applying for the domain.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Additional terms for .dk domains:</b>\nWhen ordering a .dk domain name you at the same time give your consent to waive your right of cancellation in accordance with the Danish <i>Consumer Contracts

by Feedback SAAS, LLC.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Acceptance of Registry Operator's policies, terms and conditions:</b>\nThe Registry Operator for each TLD has its own set of policies, terms and conditions.\nYou agree to obtain, read, understand and abide by the rules set forth in these policies for each of the TLDs applicable to you.\nThe policies for each TLD are listed and referenced in Appendix 1 for your convenience.\nHowever, you yourself are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the policies applicable to you, in the case that the links provided are no longer

Domainnameshop's servers or IP addresses.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, web hosting, email, unix shell access, database access, our site builder, our web forwarding service, and use of our nameservers (DNS).\nAll hosting services are subject to our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and to the limitations and restrictions specified in our FAQ, such as rate limiting of email messages and database queries, memory restrictions on PHP scripts and running processes, etc.\nWe reserve the right to update our FAQ with new limits and restrictions at any time, and these new limits and restrictions will come into effect at the time of publishing.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Web hosting:</b>\nThe web hosting service (\"web hosting\" or \"web hotel\") is a service where you rent disk space on one of Domainnameshop's servers.\nYou are assigned a username and a password, which gives you access to your own file directory for storage of files (web pages, documents, images, scripts, programs, etc.) that you upload yourself via a file transfer program.\nYou understand and agree that Domainnameshop only provides the disk space, and that you take full responsibility for the contents of all files that are uploaded to your web hotel.\nIf you install any scripts or programs, you agree to keep these up to date at all times, and to promptly upgrade to a newer version whenever needed to fix security issues.\nYou further agree to assume full and complete responsibility for, and agree that Domainnameshop shall have no responsibility or liability for, your end users' content and all activities on your web site (e.g.\ncontents in a forum or comments on a blog).\nYou understand and agree that, if you transfer your domain name or web hosting service to a third party in conjunction with a live web site or allow your domain name registration to expire, you will no longer be able to use and/or access your web hotel with us.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Email service:</b>\nYou agree not to use the email service to send unsolicited messages (\"spam\"), neither to private persons nor to companies/organizations.\nYou understand and acknowledge that Domainnameshop may filter email messages from/to your email addresses with us, in order to reduce the amount of spam messages going through our servers.\nDomainnameshop takes no responsibility or liability for email that is delayed,

material that expresses religious or political extremism, material that harass or threaten third parties, or material that violates or infringes the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe also do not allow contents related to gambling or online pharmacies.\nDomainnameshop reserves the right to, promptly and without prior notice, deactivate services and delete material that may fall under the above mentioned categories, or material that Domainnameshop considers to be objectionable, unethical or in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).\nIf in doubt whether the content you intend to distribute is within the boundaries of what we allow, please contact us for a clarification prior to publishing.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Security and confidentiality of hosting data:</b> All hosting services provided by Domainnameshop operate in a shared server environment, where multiple customers and users have login access to the same physical file and database resources.\nIt is your responsibility to make sure that the permissions on all your files and databases are set as restrictive as necessary in order to limit access only to the intended users or recipients, and that you are always using strong passwords that are hard to guess or crack.\nIf not, Domainnameshop cannot guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of your data, and you risk the possibility that unauthorized users may access your data.\nDomainnameshop does not take any responsibility for a breach of security resulting out of your failure to set correct permissions or use strong

responsibility to make sure that you are complying with all applicable legislation relating to data protection and privacy, including the Norwegian <i>Personal Data Act (Personopplysningsloven)</i> and the European Union's <i>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</i>.\nExamples of personal data include names, birth dates, postal addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, IP addresses or any other data that may be used directly or indirectly to identify natural persons.\nBy using our hosting services to store or process these types of data, you assume the role of a Data Controller, whereas Domainnameshop as the hosting provider becomes a Data Processor.\nThe relation between the Data Controller (you) and the Data Processor (us) is regulated through a Data Processing Agreement (DPA).\nOur standard DPA is attached to this Agreement in Appendix 2.\nHere we provide a high-level description of how we store and protect your hosting data.\nUltimately, you as the Data Controller must decide if the descriptions and warranties we give are sufficient for you to utilize our hosting services to store and process the types of personal data you intend to.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<b>4.\nPrivacy Policy</b>\n<p>In Domainnameshop we take your privacy seriously.\nAll personal data are collected, stored, processed, transferred and disposed of in accordance with the Norwegian <i>Personal Data Act (Personopplysningsloven)</i> and the European Union's <i>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</i>.\nThis Privacy Policy explains in detail how we process personal data.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>Who we are and how to contact us:</b>\nThe entity responsible for collecting and processing personal data (the data controller) in relation to this Agreement is Domeneshop AS, a private limited liability company incorporated in Norway with registration number 976769678.\nOur contact information is available on https://domainnameshop.com/contact.<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Personal data we collect from you:</b>\nThere are three categories of data we collect from you that may contain personal data:\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>Domain contact data</b>: Data you submit to us in order to identify the registrant, administrative contact and/or technical contact in relation to a domain name registration.\nThis includes name, address, phone number, fax number (optional) and email address.\nIn addition, birth date is collected if required by the applicable TLD.\nNational identification number is only collected for TLDs that require this, and only for citizens/residents of Sweden <i>(personnummer)</i>, Finland <i>(henkil\u00f6tunnus)</i>, Italy <i>(codice fiscale)</i> and Spain <i>(NIF/NIE)</i>.\nFor Norwegian citizens/residents applying for a .no domain, the national identification number is collected and stored with the .no Registry Operator, Norid, and a PID number is issued in its place (see https://pid.norid.no/).\nDomainnameshop only collects and processes this PID number, not the national identification number that it is linked to.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Customer contact data</b>: Data you submit to us in order to identify the Account Holder and/or billing contact in relation to a domain name registration or hosting service.\nThis includes name, address, phone number and email address(es).</li>\n<li>\n<b>Automatically collected data</b>: Data that you do not submit to us directly, but that are automatically gathered by our system when you or the users of your hosting services interact with our servers, pay invoices from us or contact our customer support.\nThis category includes web server access logs, email server logs, your list of email correspondents (address book) when using our webmail service, notifications of payments to our bank account, support history, and other automatically generated system logs.\nSuch logs may include timestamps, IP addresses, email addresses, bank account numbers, names, HTTP request headers and other data.\nOur webpages also make use of cookies, which may be used to identify individual persons.\nAn explanation of how and why we use cookies is given in our FAQ.</li>\n</ol>\nCredit card information is not collected nor stored by us, but by our third party payment processor Nets Branch Norway.<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>How your personal data are used:</b>\nYour domain contact data (category 1) are used by Domainnameshop and the Registry Operator to identify the holder and contact persons for a domain name.\nThe Registry Operator may publish the contact information, either partly or in full, in their WHOIS database, depending on their policy.\nThis is done in order to have a way to contact the person(s) responsible for the domain name, e.g.\nin case of technical problems with the domain, if the domain is being abused for spam, fraud or criminal activities, or if a dispute over third party rights to the domain name should arise.\nAdditionally, we in Domainnameshop will use your contact data (category 1 and 2) to send you invoices, renewal notices, yearly reminders to keep your contact information up-to-date and other notifications, as needed to fulfill our contractual obligations with you and with ICANN and the Registry Operator.\nAutomatically collected data (category 3) may be used by Domainnameshop to maintain, protect and improve our services, to provide you with a better customer support experience, and to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>How you can access and update your personal data:</b>\nYou can access and update your contact data for your domains and for your account with us at any time from the control panel at https://domainnameshop.com/login.\nHere you can also delete any information that is optional and not needed for the domain management process.\nYou may also subscribe to our email newsletter and control how you want us to send you invoices and notifications, e.g.\nby postal mail, email or SMS.<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>How we share your personal data:</b>\nWe will share your domain contact data with the Registry Operator for the applicable TLD, as necessary to carry out the domain name registration and management process.\nWe may also share your domain contact data with third parties to fulfill our legal and contractual obligations with you, with ICANN and with the Registry Operator.\nFor example, we may share your contact data with the dispute resolution provider according to the applicable domain name dispute resolution policy.\nIn addition, for domain names that are under a gTLD, we are contractually obligated by ICANN to publish domain contact data in WHOIS and to deposit these data to the data escrow provider Iron Mountain on a weekly basis, as a backup measure in the unlikely event that the contact information is lost from the domain name registry if the Registry Operator goes bankrupt or is subject to unrecoverable technical failure and data loss.\nWe may also share personal data with third parties who have a legitimate interest for this, for example to enable domain name transfers, to initiate contact with the domain name registrant or account holder, to renew a domain that is about to expire, to give accountants, auditors and tax authorities access to information they need, or to investigate technical problems, potential trademark infringement or fraud and other criminal activities.\nIn addition, we may share personal data with Norwegian police or other public authorities if presented with a court order, seizure warrant or other equivalent request for disclosure of information.<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Transfer of personal data outside EU/EEA:</b>\nSeveral Registry Operators and the data escrow provider that we transfer personal data to are located outside the European Union and the European Economic Area.\nThese include, among others, VeriSign (USA), Iron Mountain (USA), Neustar (Australia), Uniregistry (Cayman Islands), Radix Registry (Dubai) and GMO Registry (Japan).\nWhen personal data are transferred between us and the Registry Operator or data escrow provider, the information is always encrypted using TLS encryption of the underlying data transfer protocol (EPP or FTP).<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Automatic processing and decision-making based on personal data:</b>\nThe personal data you submit to us are subject to a number of automatic checks, and data that do not pass the checks may be rejected or flagged for manual inspection before forwarding your information to the Registry Operator.\nFor example, we may check that the address is syntactically correct, that the zipcode matches the city/place name and that the country you have specified matches the country of your IP address.<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Dataportability:</b>\nIf you decide to transfer your domain name(s) away from us, all contact information relating to your domain(s) will still be present in the Registry Operator's central registry database in a standardized format, and can be automatically transferred to your new registrar of choice using the EPP registry-registrar protocol.<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>How long we keep your personal data:</b>\nPersonal data are kept for the duration of the term of the domain name registration service or hosting service and for at least 3 years after the termination of the service.\nPersonal data pertaining to invoices and payments are kept for at least 5 years for tax purposes, as required by Norwegian law.\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Personal data processed as part of hosting services:</b>\nAny personal data that you or your users submit, upload, send, store or process using the hosting services provided by Domainnameshop are not covered by this Privacy Policy.\nThis includes personal data that are uploaded to your web site, personal data that you store in files or in a database on Domainnameshop's servers, personal data that are sent by email to or from you, or any other personal data that you collect, store, transfer or process using our hosting services that are not explicitly requested by us for fulfillment of the domain name registration process or the services we provide to you.\nDomainnameshop is not the data controller for such personal data, only data processor.\nYou as data controller are responsible for handling all such personal data in accordance with current privacy laws and regulations and, if needed, create and publish your own Privacy Policy that covers the personal data that you exchange with the users of your web site or with your email correspondents.\nFor details on how Domainnameshop processes and protects personal data as part of our hosting services, please refer to our Data Processing Agreement.<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Your right to complain:</b>\nIf you are a natural person residing in the European Union or European Economic Area and you believe that our use and processing of your personal data are not in compliance with the <i>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</i> or any other applicable legislation, you have the right to complain to the Supervisory Authority in either Norway <i>(Datatilsynet)</i> or in your country of domicile.<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<b>Appendix 1: List of Registry Operators and their policies</b>\n<p>\nThe Registry Operators for the TLDs we offer and their respective policies are listed and referenced below for your convenience.\nHowever, you

Authority is <i>Datatilsynet</i>.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.\nScope, purpose and duration of the processing</b>\n</p>\n<p>Domainnameshop, in capacity as Data Processor, will make our hosting servers available for you, the Data Controller, to store and process your data, including any personal data as defined by you.\nThe purpose of the processing is to allow you to use Domainnameshop's storage space, processing power and bandwidth capacity to upload, transfer and process personal data as part of the hosting services we provide to you.\nThe term of this DPA should follow that of the Service Agreement for the hosting services you have ordered from us.</p>\n<p>Categories of personal data may be customers, suppliers, employees, members, students, visitors, participants, users or any other groups of natural persons, as defined by the Data Controller.</p>\n<p>Types of personal data may be names, birth dates, postal addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, IP addresses, usernames, passwords, cookies, customer numbers, national identity numbers, credit card numbers, purchase history, log files, user behaviour and preferences, location data, photographs, video clips, or any other types of data, as defined by the Data Controller, that may be used alone or in conjuction with other data to identify a natural person.</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.\nData Controller's rights and responsibilities</b>\n</p>\n<p>It is your responsibility, in capacity as Data Controller:</p>\n<p>(a) to define the categories of personal data and the types of personal data that are to be processed, and to determine the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are processed;</p>\n<p>(b) to make sure that all personal data are processed according to current privacy legislation, including the GDPR;</p>\n<p>(c) by uploading or transferring personal data using our hosting services, to grant Domainnameshop permission to store the data on our servers, and to instruct us to take the necessary security precautions to protect your data from unauthorized access and unintentional data loss.\nThis includes having in place physical and logical access control procedures and taking backups at regular intervals.</p>\n<p>(d) You also have the right to terminate the hosting agreement with us if we no longer fulfill our obligations according to this Agreement or to current privacy legislation.</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nData Processor's rights and responsibilities</b>\n</p>\n<p>Domainnameshop, in capacity as Data Processor, commits to:</p>\n<p>(a) only process your personal data as instructed by you, i.e.\nas data that are to be stored and processed on our servers while protecting its integrity and confidentiality, and immediately notify you if, in our opinion, an instruction is in violation of current privacy legislation, including the GDPR;</p>\n<p>(b) make sure that all employees of Domainnameshop that have access to your personal data are authorised to do so and will treat your data confidentially, also after the hosting agreement has been terminated;</p>\n<p>(c) have in place the necessary technical and organisational security measures to ensure appropriate security of your data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage;</p>\n<p>(d) only store your data on servers in Norway and never share it with any sub-processors or third parties, except with Norwegian law-enforcement authorities if required by law;</p>\n<p>(e) relay to you any inquiries from data subjects about their

this is possible, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to us, and to immediately inform you if a security breach should occur, including the information needed for you to notify the Supervisory Authority and/or the data subjects if need be;<p>\n</p>\n<p>(g) within 12 months after the termination of the hosting agreement, delete all hosting data including any backups;</p>\n<p>(h) upon request, contribute to audits and inspections and make available to you all information needed to demonstrate compliance with our obligations as Data Processor according to this DPA and the GDPR.</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.\nSecurity measures and recommendations</b>\n</p>\n<p>As a long-standing hosting provider, Domainnameshop has employed a large variety of security measures, both technical and organisational, to protect the integrity and confidentiality of our customers' data.\nTo us, risk analysis and data protection is a continuous process.\nFor the sake of brevity, and for competitive and security reasons we cannot go into detail on every single security measure we have taken, we can only provide a high-level description of some of the hardware, software, procedures and practices we have in place to protect your data.\nThese include, but are not limited to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical access control to hosting servers</li>\n<li>Firewalls for intrusion detection and prevention</li>\n<li>Redundant storage (RAID) and power supply (UPS)</li>\n<li>Routine backup procedures with backup servers in a separate physical building (in case of fire)</li>\n<li>Short response time for applying security updates (to prevent zero-day exploits)</li>\n<li>Use of strong encryption when moving data between servers</li>\n<li>Logging to detect and prevent security incidents and to provide audit trails</li>\n<li>Disaster recovery planning and testing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Any security system is only as strong as the weakest link.\nIn a shared server hosting environment like Domainnameshop's, simple user errors like setting wrong file permissions on a file may jeopardize the security of your data.\nWe must stress the importance of setting correct permissions on all your files and databases, as well as using strong passwords for your login accounts with us.\nIn the following are some additional security recommendations to help protect your data when using our hosting services.\n</p>\n<p>We recommend that if you are using our web hosting services to process personal data, then all web traffic should be encrypted using HTTPS instead of normal (unencrypted) HTTP.\nWe offer free HTTPS encryption with industry standard algorithms and certificates for all our web hosting packages, but you may have to turn it on yourself in the control panel.</p>\n<p>Likewise, we recommend that, whenever technically possible, if you are transferring personal data to or from our hosting servers using the FTP protocol or reading email using POP or IMAP, that you use the encrypted (SSL/TLS enabled) variants of these protocols.\nDomainnameshop supports both encrypted and unencrypted data transfer, but you yourself must make sure that the client software you are using has been configured to use SSL/TLS encryption.</p>\n<p>If you store passwords, then we recommend that, whenever technically possible, these are stored in an encrypted or hashed form instead of in cleartext.</p>\n<p>We do <i>not</i> recommend that you use Domainnameshop's shared server hosting environment to process sensitive personal data.\nSensitive personal data includes information about racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation.\nFor such data we recommend a dedicated server or virtual private server (VPS) instead.\nDomainnameshop does not offer these kinds of services.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Domain
