Security<p>Last updated: March 19, 2021</p>Overview<p>A Cloud Guru is committed to protecting your information.\nThis document outlines the technical and procedural measures A Cloud Guru employs to protect Customer Data.</p>\n<p>If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact us at security@acloud.guru.</p>Platform SecurityInfrastructurePhysical access<p>A Cloud guru is primarily a serverless environment, entirely hosted in the cloud and uses the shared cloud security model.\nWe do not run our own routers, load balancers, DNS servers, or physical servers.</p>\n<p>A list of all cloud providers used to maintain security and provide services on our platform can be found on our Platform Sub-processors page</p>Infrastructure as Code<p>We manage our infrastructure as code, allowing us to audit and peer review any changes, and to provide a secure and automated process for applying these changes.</p>System Administration and Patch Management<p>A Cloud Guru leverages fully managed, ie \u201cserverless\u201d, services to deliver the platform such as AWS Lambda.\nThe provider is responsible for administering and patching the servers for in such cases.</p>\n<p>In cases where we run cloud based servers, we actively scan for security and configuration vulnerabilities and patch those servers according to the risks presented.</p>Application securitySecure Software Development<p>A Cloud Guru uses automation and reviews to ensure we develop software in a consistent, reliable and secure way.</p>Threat Modeling<p>New initiatives are required to develop threat models prior to application development.\nThose threat models result in in-depth risk analyses which are reviewed by our security team</p>Code reviews<p>All changes to the A Cloud Guru codebase are reviewed by peers.\nCode reviews are designed to ensure the security, performance and quality of code released to production.\nCode changes are staged or tested prior to deployment to production systems.</p>End User Login Protections<p>We protect our user login against a number or attack vectors including brute force attacks by utilising third party services.\nPasswords are cryptographically hashed and salted by our authorisation provider based on industry best practises.\nOur authorization provider generates user authorisation tokens to manage connections to the platform.</p>Deployment&nbsp.\nProcess<p>The deployment of the A Cloud Guru platform is entirely automated.\nChanges to both infrastructure and code are subject to automated testing using our Continuous Integration (CI) tool before being released to production.\nA change that passes our review and testing process is then deployed to production using our CI tool.</p>Penetration Testing<p>A Cloud Guru engages an independent organisation to perform regular penetration tests to assess the security of our platform.\nThe security of our platform is reviewed on a 6 monthly basis.\nThe team works quickly to mitigate potential issues identified by these reviews.</p>Data encryption and transfer<p>A Cloud Guru encrypts data both at rest and in transit.\nAll external network communication uses TLS encryption to protect it in transit.\nWe leverage the encryption tools included in public cloud data stores to encrypt data at rest.</p>Monitoring<p>Activity on A Cloud Guru\u2019s systems is logged and monitored.\nWe capture and store logs generated by our infrastructure, application code and vendors.\nThis includes but is not limited to, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Auth0, GSuite and Github.\nLogs from these systems are stored and analysed for unusual activity.&nbsp;</p>Operational SecuritySecurity Council<p>We have established a collaborative security council for surfacing security concerns across the business.\nRepresentatives from the various business units participate in regular discussions about security and compliance issues, and executive participants make high level decisions.</p>Security Team<p>A Cloud Guru has a dedicated security team.\nOur security team works with all teams at A Cloud Guru to ensure security is built into everything we do.</p>People and Process<p>All members of the A Cloud Guru team, including full-time employees and contractors are required to comply with internal security policies and practices.\nThese policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with law and security best practices.</p>Employee Access to Data<p>A Cloud Guru restricts access to systems and infrastructure to A Cloud Guru personnel (or, at limited times, consultants who are bound by confidentiality and data protection standards) who require access as part of their job responsibilities.\nAccess removal processes are used to revoke access to personnel who no longer need it.</p>Passwords and Authentication<p>A Cloud Guru enforces a password policy and a requirement for multi-factor authentication to protect sensitive systems.</p>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery<p>A Cloud Guru maintains a Business Continuity plan for the A Cloud Guru organization.</p>\n<p>Backups are a central part of our Disaster Recovery strategy.\nCustomer data is stored in Cloud storage services.\nAll data is backed-up on at least a daily basis.</p>ComplianceOverview<p>A Cloud Guru is committed to protecting your information.\nWhile A Cloud Guru has not yet undergone a 3rd party security audit for SOC-2 or ISO27001, 27018, we utilize the security controls present in those frameworks and have chosen cloud hosting providers that are SOC and ISO compliant.</p>PCI Obligations<p>A Cloud Guru uses certified third-party payment providers (such as, Chargebee, Braintree, Stripe, and Authorize.Net) to comply with applicable PCI standards.\nA copy of our compliance certification can be found here.</p>Notification of Security Breach<p>A Cloud Guru adheres to GDPR and applicable U.S.\nstate requirements for data breach notification standards.\nIn the event of a security breach A Cloud Guru will take actions to contain, investigate and mitigate the breach.\nA Cloud Guru will notify affected customers in the event of a breach in the manner and within the time frames required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>An unsuccessful security incident will not be subject to notification.\nAn unsuccessful security incident is one that results in no unauthorised access to Personal Data or to any of ACG\u2019s equipment or facilities storing Personal Data, and may include, without limitation, pings and other broadcast attacks on firewalls or edge servers, port scans, unsuccessful log-on attempts, denial of service attacks, packet sniffing (or other unauthorised access to traffic data that does not result in access beyond headers) or similar incidents.</p>Contact Us<p>If you have concerns, don\u2019t hesitate to contact our team.</p>\n<p>Email: security@acloud.guru</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning</li>\n<li>For Business</li>\n<li>For

of:&nbsp.\nFebruary 1, 2021</p>\n<p>This Master Services Agreement (\u201c<b>MSA</b>\u201d) is incorporated into the Order Form executed between the subscribing entity (\u201c<b>Subscriber</b>\u201d) and the A Cloud Guru entity executing the Order Form (Serverless Heroes, Inc., A Cloud Guru, Ltd., or Linux Academy, Inc.) (each and collectively, \u201c<b>ACG</b>\u201d).&nbsp.\nThe MSA sets forth the terms and conditions that govern the provision, access, and use of all services, products, and platforms offered by ACG (collectively, the \u201c<b>Services</b>\u201d) and, along with Subscriber\u2019s Order Form, forms this Agreement (the \u201c<b>Agreement</b>\u201d) between Subscriber and ACG.</p>\n<p>THIS MSA APPLIES TO BUSINESS SUBSCRIBERS ONLY.&nbsp.\nFor any individual subscribing to the Services for personal use, ACG\u2019s Terms of Use apply instead.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.&nbsp.\nORDER DETAILS</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.1.&nbsp.\nOrder Forms.</b>&nbsp.\nSubscriber orders a subscription to the Services by entering into an Order Form (as may be amended or modified from time to time) between Subscriber and ACG (an \u201c<b>Order Form</b>\u201d).&nbsp.\n&nbsp;An Order Form will be one of the following: (a) a written order form or other agreement (including any exhibits thereto) entered into by Subscriber and ACG.\n(b) if eligible, ACG\u2019s acceptance of Subscriber\u2019s completion of the online ordering process made available on the ACG platform, website, or app (the \u201c<strong>ACG Site</strong>\u201c) \u2013 for these purchases, Serverless Heroes, Inc.\nis the ACG party to the Agreement.\nor (c) if subscribing through an authorized reseller of the Services the agreement(s) for the Services entered into by Subscriber and the reseller and approved by ACG, together with any additional agreements ACG may require.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.2.&nbsp.\nOrder Form Terms.</b>&nbsp.\nCertain terms of this Agreement will be detailed in Subscriber\u2019s Order Form.&nbsp.\nThe Order Form will also designate the length of the subscription term (\u201c<b>Subscription Term</b>\u201d).&nbsp.\nIf the Order Form contains terms that conflict with or are in addition to the terms of this MSA the terms of the Order Form will control.&nbsp.\nCapitalized terms used in this MSA and/or the Order Form will have the same meaning within each.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.3.&nbsp.\nFees.</b>&nbsp.\nSubscriber\u2019s Order Form or a corresponding invoice issued by ACG will set forth the payment terms and fees due to ACG in connection with the Services for the applicable Subscription Term (\u201c<b>Fees</b>\u201d).&nbsp.\nIf any Fees are not received when due, ACG may apply a monthly late fee of the lower of 1.5% of the outstanding balance or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, unless and until all Fees and other sums due are paid in full.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.4.&nbsp.\nAuthorized Users.&nbsp.\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>a.&nbsp.\nSubscriber Group.&nbsp.\nSubscriber\u2019s Order Form will designate the number of Subscriber\u2019s authorized users of the Services (\u201c<b>Users</b>\u201d).&nbsp.\nSubscriber may designate only the following individuals as Users: employees or independent contractors of Subscriber or its affiliates who will access and use the Services by or through Subscriber and solely for the benefit of Subscriber or its affiliates.&nbsp.\nOnly Users permitted under this Agreement may use the Services.&nbsp.\nSubscriber and its Users are collectively referred to as the \u201c<b>Subscriber Group</b>.\u201d</p>\n<p>b.&nbsp.\nUser Licenses.&nbsp.\nEach User corresponds to a single User license.&nbsp.\nSubscriber will ensure that only one person accesses the Services per each User license.&nbsp.\nIf Subscriber exceeds the usage authorized by the Order Form (for example, by exceeding the number of authorized Users or exceeding the Subscription Term), then ACG reserves the right to charge and invoice Subscriber the pro-rata Fees corresponding to such overage.</p>\n<p>c.&nbsp.\nAdding Users.&nbsp.\nSubscriber may add additional users to Subscriber\u2019s subscription during any Subscription Term (\u201c<b>Additional Users\u201d</b>).&nbsp.\nACG will notify Subscriber in advance of any pro-rata additional Fees associated with the Additional Users.&nbsp.\nSubscriber may be required to modify its existing Order Form or enter into a new Order Form to add Additional Users.&nbsp.\nIf there is a delay in executing an Order Form for Additional Users, then ACG reserves the right to, rather than extend the Subscription Term, reduce the Fees for those Additional Users on a pro-rata basis commensurate with the reduction in length of the Additional Users\u2019 Subscription Term \u2014 this is to ensure that the expiration dates of Subscriber\u2019s original Order Form and its Additional User Order Form are coterminous.</p>\n<p>d.&nbsp.\nOne-Time Transfer.&nbsp.\nIf Subscriber purchases 10 or more licenses, Subscriber may effectuate a one-time transfer of up to 10% of its purchased licenses from their original User to a new User (for example, if Subscriber purchases 100 licenses, Subscriber may transfer up to 10 of those licenses to a new user one time each).&nbsp.\nNone of the licenses eligible for transfer may be transferred more than once.&nbsp.\nOnce a license is transferred, the User from whom the license was transferred may no longer use the Services during the Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>e.&nbsp.\nAccount Admin.&nbsp.\nSubscriber\u2019s ACG account will be administered by an employee of Subscriber (or an affiliate) designated by Subscriber (\u201c<b>Admin.</b>\u201d).&nbsp.\nThe Admin.\nwill have the right to manage Subscriber\u2019s account and its Users in accordance with this Agreement and will act as an authorized representative of Subscriber in dealings with ACG related to Subscriber\u2019s account and use of the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.&nbsp.\n</strong>\n<b>THE SERVICES</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.1.&nbsp.\nAccess and Use.</b>&nbsp.\nSubject to the Subscriber Group\u2019s compliance with the terms of this Agreement, during the Subscription Term, ACG will provide and maintain the Services ordered by Subscriber, together with all content, works, and materials incorporated into the Services (the \u201c<b>Subscription Content</b>\u201d), for access and use by the Subscriber Group in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp.\nCertain portions or features of the Services may be provided or maintained by an affiliate of ACG with ACG remaining responsible for the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.2.&nbsp.\nPlans.</b>&nbsp.\nACG may offer different plan options (currently a \u201cBasic\u201d and a \u201cPlus\u201d Plan), each with different prices and features, for Subscriber to choose from when ordering the Services (each a \u201c<b>Plan</b>\u201d).&nbsp.\nThe features included in each Plan are described on a designated page of ACG\u2019s website (currently at https://acloudguru.com/pricing) or at or in connection with the point of purchase of the Services.&nbsp.\nSubscriber may \u201cupgrade\u201d to a higher-tiered Plan (e.g.\nfrom Basic to Plus) at any time during the Subscription Term by executing an Order Form for the upgrade.&nbsp.\nUpgrades will become effective, and any additional Fees associated with an upgrade will be due, as provided for in the upgrade Order Form.&nbsp.\nSubscriber may not \u201cdowngrade\u201d to a lower-tiered Plan during its then-current Subscription Term.&nbsp.\nIf Subscriber downgrades at the end of its Subscription Term, Subscriber will no longer have access to any features or Subscription Content that is only available through the higher-tiered Plan.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.3.&nbsp.\nFeature Terms.&nbsp.\n</b>Certain features of the Services may be governed by terms applicable to that specific feature (\u201c<b>Feature Terms</b>\u201d), which Feature Terms will supplement the terms of this MSA.&nbsp.\nYou agree to ACG\u2019s Hands-on Features Terms in connection with your use of any interactive Hands-on Features such as Cloud Playground and Hands-on Labs.&nbsp.\nThe Hand-on Feature Terms are available at https://acloudguru.com/policies/tou-cloud-playground and are incorporated into this MSA by reference.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.4.&nbsp.\nTrials and Pilots.</b>&nbsp.\nACG may, at its sole discretion, offer Subscriber free or discounted trials or pilots (a \u201c<b>Trial</b>\u201d).&nbsp.\nAll Trials and Order Forms applicable thereto will be subject to this MSA and/or any other terms as ACG determines.&nbsp.\nACG may cancel or modify the terms of a free Trial at any time, without prior notice and

\u201c<strong>you</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>your</strong>\u201d), where those services are governed by GDPR or where the parties otherwise agree that this DPA applies.\nThis DPA supplements and is incorporated into the Agreement between ACG and Subscriber.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BACKGROUND AND INTERPRETATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A.\nSubscriber and ACG entered into an Agreement that may require ACG to process Personal Data on behalf of Subscriber.</p>\n<p>B.\nThis DPA contains the mandatory clauses required by Article 28(3) of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/67) (\u201c<strong>GDPR</strong>\u201d) for contracts between controllers and processors.</p>\n<p>C.\nThis DPA consists of two parts: the main body of the DPA, and Annex A, B (including Appendices 1 and 2) and C.&nbsp.\nThis DPA, including the Standard Contractual Clauses in Annex B, form a part of the Agreement and are each deemed to be executed in connection with the execution of the Agreement by ACG and Subscriber and legally binding upon such parties.</p>\n<p>D.\nThe Annexes hereto form part of this DPA, and any reference to this DPA includes the Annexes.&nbsp.\nIn the case of conflicting terms, the following terms will govern, in order of precedence: first, the Standard Contractual Clauses, then the body of this DPA, then the Annexes to this DPA, then the Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>AGREED TERMS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;DEFINITIONS</strong>.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise defined in the Agreement or in the body of this DPA, all

a part of this DPA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>DATA PROCESSING</strong>.</p>\n<p>2.1.&nbsp.\nWith respect to Personal Data of Data Subjects: (a) ACG will act as \u201cprocessor\u201d of Personal Data and Subscriber will act either as \u201ccontroller\u201d or \u201cprocessor,\u201d as defined by GDPR.\nand (b) ACG will acts as a \u201cService Provider\u201d as defined by CCPA</p>\n<p>2.2.&nbsp.\nSubscriber retains control of the Personal Data and remains responsible for its compliance obligations under the applicable Data Protection Laws, including providing any required notices and obtaining any required consents, and for the processing instructions it gives to ACG.</p>\n<p>2.3.&nbsp.\nAnnex A describes the subject matter, duration, nature and

otherwise initiated or instructed by Subscriber or its Data Subjects (e.g., via email, support tickets or instructions for configuration of tools or features made available by ACG in connection with the Services) (\u201c<strong>Instructions</strong>\u201c), or (b) as required by Data Protection Laws.&nbsp.\nThe parties agree that the Agreement and DPA are deemed to be Instructions.&nbsp.\nAny additional or alternate instructions must be agreed separately agreed upon by Subscriber and ACG.&nbsp.\nACG will promptly notify Subscriber if, in ACG\u2019s opinion, Subscriber\u2019s Instructions would not comply with Data Protection Laws.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL DATA.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>ACG will maintain the confidentiality of all Personal Data and will not disclose Personal Data to third parties except as authorized by Subscriber\u2019s Agreement, as otherwise by Subscriber in writing, or as required by law.\nIf a law, court, regulator or supervisory authority requires ACG to process or disclose Personal Data, ACG will first inform Subscriber of the legal or regulatory requirement and give Subscriber an opportunity to object or challenge the requirement, unless ACG is legally prohibited from doing so.\nIf the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, nothing in this Section 3 varies or modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>\n<strong> Obligations OF ACG PERSONNEL</strong>.</p>\n<p>ACG restricts its personnel from processing Personal Data

appropriate to the risk involved, including as appropriate:</p>\n<p>(a) the pseudonymization and encryption of Personal Data when such data is being transferred;</p>\n<p>(b) process to maintain the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;</p>\n<p>(c) written plan to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident.\nand</p>\n<p>(d) a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of security measures.</p>\n<p>Such measures may be

use sub-processors to fulfill its contractual obligations under the Agreement or this DPA or to provide certain services on its behalf.&nbsp.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the above authorization constitutes Subscriber\u2019s written consent to the sub-processing by ACG for the purposes of Clause 11 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.&nbsp.\nACG\u2019s Sub-processor List (available at&nbsp;https://acloudguru.com/policies/subprocessors) (\u201c<strong>Sub-processor List</strong>\u201c) contains an updated list of sub-processors that are currently engaged by ACG to carry out processing activities on Personal Data on behalf of Subscriber.</p>\n<p>6.2.&nbsp.\nACG will provide notice of new subprocessors by publicly posting new sub-processors on ACG\u2019s Sub-processor List, with a date-updated notice, prior to authorizing any to new sub-processor to process Personal Data.&nbsp.\nSubscriber may also subscribe to receive updates as provided on the Subprocessor List page.&nbsp.\nSubscriber may reasonably object to ACG\u2019s use of a new sub-processor (if making the Personal Data available to sub-processor may violate applicable Data Protection Laws or weaken the protections of such Personal Data) by notifying ACG in writing within ten (10) business days after receipt of ACG\u2019s notice.&nbsp.\nSuch notice to ACG shall explain the reasonable grounds for the objection.&nbsp.\nIn the event Subscriber so objects to a new sub-processor, ACG will use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to Subscriber a change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Subscriber\u2019s configuration or use of the Services to avoid the processing of Personal Data by the objectionable sub-processor without burdening Subscriber.&nbsp.\nIf ACG is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, either party may terminate without penalty the Agreement with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by ACG without the use of the objectionable new sub-processor by providing written notice to the other party.&nbsp.\nExcept as set forth in this Section, or as Subscriber may otherwise authorize, ACG will not permit any sub-processor to carry out processing activities on Personal Data on behalf of Subscriber.</p>\n<p>6.3.&nbsp.\nWhere ACG authorizes any sub-processor as described above:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp.\nACG will restrict the sub-processor\u2019s access to Personal Data only to what is necessary to maintain the Services or to provide the Services to Subscriber and any Users in accordance with the Agreement and ACG will prohibit the sub-processor from accessing Personal Data for any other purpose;</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp.\nACG maintains control over all Personal Data it entrusts to the sub-processor;</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp.\nACG will enter into a written agreement with the sub-processor and, to the extent that the sub-processor is performing the same data processing services that are being provided by ACG under this DPA, ACG will impose on the sub-processor the same contractual obligations that ACG has under this DPA.\nand</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp.\nACG will remain responsible for its compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of the sub-processors that cause ACG to breach any of ACG\u2019s obligations under this DPA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</strong>.</p>\n<p>7.1.&nbsp.\nACG will, at no additional cost, take such technical and organizational measures as may be appropriate, and promptly provide such information to Subscriber as Subscriber may reasonably require, to enable Subscriber to comply with:</p>\n<p>(a) the rights of Data Subjects under applicable Data Protection Laws, including subject access rights, the rights to rectify and erase personal data, object to the processing and automated processing of personal data, and restrict the processing of personal data.\nand</p>\n<p>(b) information or assessment notices served on Subscriber by any supervisory authority under the Data Protection Laws.</p>\n<p>7.2.&nbsp.\nACG will notify Subscriber immediately if it receives any complaint, notice or communication that relates directly or indirectly to the processing of the Personal Data or to either party\u2019s compliance with the Data Protection Laws.</p>\n<p>7.3.&nbsp.\nACG will notify Subscriber within ten (10) business days if it receives a request from a Data Subject to exercise any of their related rights under the Data Protection Laws.</p>\n<p>7.4.&nbsp.\nACG will provide Subscriber with reasonable assistance in responding to any complaint, notice, communication or Data Subject request.</p>\n<p>7.5.&nbsp.\nACG will not disclose the Personal Data to any Data Subject or to a third party other than at Subscriber\u2019s request or instruction, as provided for in this DPA or as required by law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>SECURITY BREACH NOTIFICATION</strong>.</p>\n<p>8.1.&nbsp.\nACG will (a) notify Subscriber of a Personal Data Breach without undue delay after becoming aware of the Personal Data Breach, and (b) take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Personal Data Breach.</p>\n<p>8.2.&nbsp.\nTo assist Subscriber in relation to any Personal Data breach notifications Subscriber is required to make under the Data Protection Laws, ACG will include in the notification under Section 8.1(a) such information about the Personal Data Breach as ACG is reasonably able to disclose to Subscriber, taking into account the nature of the Services, the information available to ACG, and any restrictions on disclosing the information, such as confidentiality.</p>\n<p>8.3.&nbsp.\nSubscriber agrees that:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp.\nAn unsuccessful Personal Data Breach will not be subject to this Section.\nAn unsuccessful Personal Data Breach is one that results in no unauthorized access to Personal Data or to any of ACG\u2019s equipment or facilities storing Personal Data, and may include, without limitation, pings and other broadcast attacks on firewalls or edge servers, port scans, unsuccessful log-on attempts, denial of service attacks, packet sniffing (or other unauthorized access to traffic data that does not result in access beyond headers) or similar incidents.\nand</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp.\nACG\u2019s obligation to report or respond to a Personal Data Breach under this Section is not and will not be construed as an acknowledgment by ACG of any fault or liability of ACG with respect to the Personal Data Breach.</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp.\nNotification(s) of Personal Data Breaches, if any, will be delivered to one or more of Subscriber\u2019s account administrators or other contact information provided in the Agreement by any reasonable notification means, including via email.&nbsp.\nIt is Subscriber\u2019s sole responsibility to ensure Subscriber\u2019s administrators and contacts maintain accurate contact information on the Subscriber account at all times.</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp.\nSubscriber will cooperate in good faith with ACG\u2019s reasonable and lawful requests, within Subscriber\u2019s reasonable control, to assist in mitigating the effects and minimizing any damage resulting from a Personal Data Breach.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>AUDITS</strong>\n<strong>.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>9.1.&nbsp.\nACG shall permit Subscriber (or its appointed third party auditors), at Subscriber\u2019s cost, to audit ACG\u2019s compliance with this DPA or Data Protection Laws, and shall make available to Subscriber all information, systems and staff under the direct control of ACG reasonably necessary for Subscriber (or its third-party auditors) to conduct such audit upon sixty (60) days\u2019 prior written notice, but solely as such audit relates to ACG\u2019s processing of the Personal Data (not any other aspect of ACG\u2019s business or information systems).\nACG acknowledges that it will provide Subscriber (or its third-party auditors) all necessary information and personnel as may be required to conduct such audit.\nprovided however, that (a) such audit and the derivative work product produced in response to such audit shall at all times be subject to the provisions set forth in the confidentiality provisions set forth in the Agreement and (b) Subscriber will not have the right to audit, review, inspect or access any third party vendor or subcontractor site, but ACG will have a duty to seek to arrange a site visit when required by a governmental authority.&nbsp.\nSubscriber will make every effort to cooperate with ACG to schedule such audits at times that are convenient to ACG and Subscriber may not exercise its audit rights more than once in any twelve (12) calendar month period, except (i) if and when required by the instruction of a competent data protection authority.\nor (ii) Subscriber reasonably believes a further audit is necessary due to a Personal Data Breach suffered by ACG.</p>\n<p>9.2.&nbsp.\nACG will reasonably assist Subscriber with meeting Subscriber\u2019s compliance obligations under the Data Protection Laws, taking into account the nature of ACG\u2019s processing and the information available to ACG, including in relation to Data Subject rights, data protection impact assessments and reporting to and consulting with supervisory authorities under the Data Protection Laws.</p>\n<p>9.3.&nbsp.\nIf the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, nothing in this Section varies or modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses nor affects any supervisory authority\u2019s or data subject\u2019s rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>PERSONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong>\n<strong>.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>10.1.&nbsp.\nSubscriber agrees that ACG will have the right to transfer personal Personal Data to ACG or its affiliates located in the United States, the United Kingdom, and/or Australia.&nbsp.\nExcept for the foregoing transfers to ACG or its affiliates, ACG shall not transfer the Personal Data (nor permit the Personal Data to be transferred) to any jurisdiction other than those to which transfers are permitted under the Data Protection Laws unless ACG has first obtained Subscriber\u2019s prior written consent and takes such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer is in compliance with Data Protection Laws.\nSuch measures may include (without limitation) transferring the Personal Data to a recipient in a country that the

expectations for participants within the ACLOUD.GURU community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior.\nWe are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored.</p>\n<p>Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.</p>\n<p>Our online community strives to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be friendly and patient.</li>\n<li>Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.\nThis includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>\n<li>Be considerate: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others.\nAny decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.\nRemember that we\u2019re a world\u00adwide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else\u2019s primary language.</li>\n<li>Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.\nWe might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.\nIt\u2019s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</li>\n<li>Be careful in the words that we choose: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.\nBe kind to others.\nDo not insult or put down other participants.\nHarassment and other exclusionary behavior aren\u2019t acceptable.</li>\n<li>Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time.\nIt is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.\nRemember that we\u2019re different.\nThe strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds.\nDifferent people have different perspectives on issues.\nBeing unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re wrong.\nDon\u2019t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn\u2019t get us anywhere.\nInstead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</li>\n</ul>Definitions<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation</li>\n<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person\u2019s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment</li>\n<li>Deliberate misgendering.\nThis includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person\u2019s gender identity.\nYou must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle</li>\n<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like \u201chug\u201d or \u201cbackrub\u201d) without consent or after a request to stop</li>\n<li>Threats of violence, both physical and psychological</li>\n<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self\u00adharm</li>\n<li>Deliberate intimidation</li>\n<li>Stalking or following</li>\n<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes</li>\n<li>Sustained disruption of discussion</li>\n<li>Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off\u00adtopic sexual images or behaviour</li>\n<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>\n<li>Continued one\u00adon\u00adone communication after requests to cease</li>\n<li>Deliberate \u201couting\u201d of any aspect of a person\u2019s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse</li>\n<li>Publication of non\u00adharassing private communication</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our open source community prioritizes marginalized people\u2019s safety over privileged people\u2019s comfort.\nWe will not act on complaints regarding:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2018Reverse\u2019 \u00adisms, including \u2018reverse racism,\u2019 \u2018reverse sexism,\u2019 and \u2018cisphobia\u2019</li>\n<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as \u201cleave me alone,\u201d \u201cgo away,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not discussing this with you\u201d</li>\n<li>Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts</li>\n<li>Communicating in a \u2018tone\u2019 you don\u2019t find congenial</li>\n<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li>\n</ul>Diversity Statement<p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all.</p>\n<p>Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible.</p>\n<p>Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it.\nIf someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.</p>\n<p>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability.\nWe will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.</p>Reporting Issues<p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior\u2014or have any other concerns\u2014please report it by contacting us via abuse@acloud.guru.\nAll reports will be handled with discretion.\nIn your report please include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your contact information.</li>\n<li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved.\nIf there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.\nYour account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing.\nIf there is a publicly available record (e.g.\na mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.</li>\n<li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond.\nIf the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.\nIf the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team.\nWe will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning</li>\n<li>For
