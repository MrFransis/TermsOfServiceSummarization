vulnerability or security concern regarding any&nbsp;Sanity.io&nbsp;product, please contact security@sanity.io </p>\n<p>We will verify the report and take corrective action as soon as possible, then notify our users and the relevant authorities of the issue.\nOur GPG key is available via sks-keyservers.net and also from us.</p>ComplianceSOC 2 Type 1<p>Sanity.io is a SOC 2 Type 1 certified provider.\nOur SOC 2 examination covers the Security principle in the Trust Services Criteria.\nThis assesses our systems and the access control designs we have in place to prevent unauthorized access to customer data.</p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)<p>Sanity.io&nbsp;is fully GDPR-compliant, and we handle our customers' personal data with great care and respect, as outlined in our terms of service, privacy policy, and throughout this document.\nWe use industry best practices for security and privacy, and have vetted all third-party processors we employ for compliance as well.\nData controlled by our customers and provided via our API is ultimately our customers' responsibility under the GDPR, but we provide tools such as data retrieval via our GROQ query language, custom data retention policies, and APIs for permanent data deletion, as well as strict security practices, which allows our customers to remain compliant as well.</p>PCI DSS<p>All credit card and payment information is handled by our payment processor,&nbsp;Stripe.\nThey have been audited by an independent PCI Qualified Security Assessor and certified as a PCI Service Provider level 1, the most stringent certification available in the payments industry.</p>Infrastructure<p>Google Cloud Platform, which hosts&nbsp;Sanity.io, undergoes regular independent audits for a&nbsp;range of standards&nbsp;including ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, SOC 2, SOC 3, CSA STAR, EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.</p>Infrastructure Security<p>Sanity.io&nbsp;is hosted on&nbsp;Google Cloud Platform, which employs some of the best security practices in the industry.\nThis is described in the&nbsp;Google security whitepaper&nbsp;and&nbsp;Google infrastructure security design overview, and includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Physical security:</strong>&nbsp;All data centers have electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, biometrics, laser beam intrusion detection, interior and exterior cameras with tracking, security guards, access logs, and more.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Hardware security:</strong>&nbsp;Stripped-down, custom-built servers and network equipment with a chip-based root of trust for verification, identification, and authentication, a secure boot stack with cryptographically signed BIOS, bootloader, kernel, and base operating system image, and automated patching of firmware and software vulnerabilities.\nVirtual machines are isolated from the host and each other via a specially hardened version of the open source KVM virtualization stack.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Network security:</strong>&nbsp;A private, global fiber-optic network extending to points-of-presence near the end user's local ISP, with automatic encryption of all internal WAN traffic using AES and elliptic-curve Diffie Hellman key exchange, logically isolated virtual private cloud networks spanning all data centers, hardware-rooted cryptographically authenticated control plane RPC calls, fully distributed firewall rule enforcement, IP spoofing protection, and systematic anomaly detection.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data security:</strong>&nbsp;All data is encrypted at rest with the industry-standard AES cipher, using regularly rotated encryption keys that are integrated with cryptographically authenticated service identities and automatically deleted on service termination.\nHard drives and SSDs are also encrypted at the hardware level, and decommissioned disks are securely erased with two independent verification processes and physically destroyed on-premise.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Employee security:</strong>&nbsp;All Google employees undergo relevant background checks and security training, and must sign confidentiality agreements.\nOnly a small group of employees have access to customer data, on a least-privilege need-to-know basis, with all access monitored by dedicated audit teams.\nLess than one percent of employees have physical access to data centers.\nAll employee access is authenticated, authorized, and encrypted using Google's&nbsp;BeyondCorp security model.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sanity.io&nbsp;employees do not have physical access to data centers, nor access to the underlying Google infrastructure.</p>Application SecurityAuthentication and Access Control<p>Users log in to their&nbsp;Sanity.io&nbsp;accounts using external authentication providers (currently Google Accounts and GitHub) via an OAuth 2 flow, optionally with two-factor authentication, which we strongly recommend.\nThe user's password is never transmitted to us, and we do not gain access to any external resources that belong to the account.\nUsers with our third-party login feature can also implement their own authentication solution.</p>\n<p>The client gains a Sanity access token, which is transmitted either as a cookie or a HTTP header, providing access to our HTTP API.\nThe token automatically expires when not used for some time.\nThis token is converted to a short-lived cryptographically signed JWT token when traversing our frontend infrastructure, which is used to authenticate and authorize all internal RPC calls.</p>\n<p>Sanity.io&nbsp;datasets can be configured with either public or private read access by default, and individual authenticated users can be assigned various roles giving them read or write access as required.\nCustomers with custom access control can also set custom access rules on documents matching specific filters.</p>Encryption<p>All access to Sanity resources by end users is encrypted in transit with HTTPS transport layer security (TLS).\nSupport for the older SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols is disabled, as are several older cipher suites, since these have known security vulnerabilities.\nInternally, data is encrypted in transit and at rest as outlined under Infrastructure security.</p>Data Retention and Removal<p>We record a complete version history for transactions and documents submitted via our API and content studio.\nThis version history has a maximum retention period determined by the project's plan, after which the history is truncated.\nUsers can configure shorter retention periods for various document types, and can also purge the complete history of individual documents via a separate API endpoint.\nUploaded assets and files can be deleted immediately via our API.</p>\n<p>After removal, data will still be retained in our backups for some time, as outlined in our terms of service, to allow for recovery in the case of accidental or malicious removal.\nDeleted assets may also remain in public CDN caches according to their configured expiry time, but can be removed on request.</p>Application Development Lifecycle<p>We use continuous delivery to enable rapid and systematic development, testing, and deployment of our product, with automated error reporting and monitoring to alert us of problems.\nThis ensures a quick and effective response to potential bugs and security issues, and reduces the risk of human error.</p>Data Security and PrivacyEncryption<p>All data is encrypted in transit and at rest as outlined in Infrastructure security.</p>Access Control<p>Employees access central resources using two-factor authentication via Google Accounts, and only have access to the systems required for their role.\nAll remote access is encrypted, either via HTTPS transport level security or via VPN connections.\nEmployees will never directly access customer-controlled data unless required for support reasons, and will generally ask the customer for permission first.</p>\n<p>Internal services are isolated from the Internet to the extent possible, and only have access to the specific resources they need, with the minimum necessary privilege level, using a combination of service-specific cryptographically signed access tokens or passwords and network-level firewall rules.\nAccess tokens are stored encrypted in our Kubernetes orchestration platform, only available via authenticated and encrypted RPC calls from the Kubelet node agents, and provided to specific applications in isolated Linux cgroups namespaces without ever hitting disk.</p>Data Retention and Removal<p>All data is removed or anonymized as soon as possible after deletion or service cancellation, with a short grace period and backup retention as outlined in our terms of service to allow for recovery in the case of accidental or malicious removal.\nUsers can also contact us to have their data removed.\nStorage devices are securely decommissioned after use as outlined in Infrastructure security.</p>Security Audits and Software Upgrades<p>We perform regular internal security audits and software upgrades every three months to ensure our systems are secure and reliable, and take immediate measures whenever significant security vulnerabilities are discovered.</p>Credit Cards and Payments<p>Credit cards and payments are processed by our payment provider,&nbsp;Stripe.&nbsp;Sanity.io&nbsp;never receives credit card information, nor do we have access to it, and it is removed from Stripe as soon as the customer updates their card information or closes their account.</p>Geographic Location<p>All customer-controlled data provided via our API is stored permanently within the EU.\nHowever, during delivery to end users it may be stored transiently in locations outside of the EU, such as in CDN caches, networking equipment, and browser caches, depending on the project configuration (e.g.\nprivate data sets).\nData which we control, such as our user database and email processing, may be stored in the U.S.\nwith third-party processors employed by us in order to deliver the service - see below for more information.</p>Third-Party Processors<p>Customer-controlled data provided via our API is only stored in Google Cloud Platform, and never shared with any other third parties.\nOther customer data for which we are a controller, such as our user database, email processing, error reporting, and so on, may be sent to certain third-party processors which we employ to deliver our services, as detailed in our terms of service.\nWe have vetted the security and compliance of all such processors, and all transfers are performed securely and in line with best practices.\nProcessors outside of the EU all comply with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield framework, and have signed data processing addendums with us for the processing of personal data.\nWe never share any customer data, personal or otherwise, with third parties unless employed by us under contract as data processors.</p>Business ContinuityHigh Availability<p>Sanity.io&nbsp;is built using fully redundant and distributed systems, running across multiple data centers, and can withstand the loss of a single component or entire data center without significant service disruptions.\nComponents are regularly taken out of service during routine maintenance, without affecting availability, and Google Cloud Platform's live migration technology transparently migrates virtual machines to other hosts prior to infrastructure maintenance.</p>\n<p>Incoming traffic is anycast-routed to Google's globally distributed load balancers, which pass it on to the nearest available data center, automatically routing around outages.\nThe load balancers and CDN can absorb many types of DDoS attacks (distributed denial of service), and many of our backend systems will automatically scale to handle increased load.</p>\n<p>Data centers have primary and alternate power sources, as well as diesel engine backup generators, each of which can provide enough electrical power to run the data center at full capacity.\nData centers also have automated fire detection and suppression equipment.</p>Backups<p>In addition to real-time replication across data centers, our databases are also continuously backed up to remote storage in multiple EU regions, and can be restored to any point in time within the past 30 days with per-transaction precision.\nFiles and assets are replicated across multiple EU regions as well, with 7 day backups of historical versions.</p>Disaster Recovery<p>We make daily copies of all backups to a separate cloud account in a separate geographic region, for disaster recovery purposes.\nThese copies are managed by separate infrastructure, using separate access controls, and are only accessible by two of our employees using dedicated physical authentication devices from clean computers.</p>\n<p>Although our web frontend systems are distributed across the world, our backend systems currently run across three data centers in a single EU region (Belgium) - we plan to implement a fully global backend infrastructure, with customer-controlled data placement.\nIn the highly unlikely event of a region-wide outage or similar disaster, we can fully recover to a different region with no data loss within 12-24 hours.</p>Corporate SecurityEmployees<p>All employees are required to sign confidentiality agreements, and are only given access to the systems they need for their role.\nEmployee computers are secured with encrypted hard drives, firmware passwords, and firewalls, and access to central resources and third-party services are always encrypted and protected with two-factor authentication, using a combination of passwords, time-based one time passwords on dedicated devices, and cryptographic private keys.\nOur offices are secured with alarms and a combination of electronic and mechanical locks, with access logs.</p>Disclosure Policy<p>If a security issue or data leak is discovered, we will notify the affected users and relevant authorities as soon as possible, in line with current regulations.\nWe also publish live reports of operational issues on our&nbsp;status page, which supports email notifications as well.</p>", "created_at": "2021-11-17 18:08:15.805304", "updated_at": "2021-11-17 17:09:26.846804"}, {"id": 10175, "name": "Terms Of Service", "url":

and Sanity US Inc.\n(\"Sanity\").\nFor Sanity, the protection and confidentiality of your data is of the utmost importance.\nIf you have any concerns about privacy and personal data you may contact our Data Protection Officer, Jose Estrada, at dpo@sanity.io.</p>\n<p>Sanity collects and uses your personal data strictly within the legal limits of the data protection law of the Kingdom of Norway, the EU General Data Protection Regulation no.\n2016/679 and UK GDPR (collectively, the \"GDPR\") as incorporated in Norwegian law, in addition to applicable data protection laws in the United States, including but not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d).\nTerms that we use in this document like \"personal data\", \"processing\", \"data controller\" and \"data processor\" shall have the meaning as defined therein.</p>\n<p>This privacy policy informs you of the kinds, extents and purposes of any collection and use of personal data, and is divided into the following sections:</p>\n<p>Personal data we collect and use with our platform is detailed in Section 1.</p>\n<p>General aspects regarding processing of personal data and your rights in Section 2.</p>\n<p>Details of third party service providers and other personal data we collect and use when you visit our website Sanity.io at https://www.sanity.io/third-party-sub-processors.</p>\n<p>Please address any requests regarding privacy to privacy@sanity.io or write to us at the postal address stated above.</p>\n<p>We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time.\nAll changes will be effective immediately upon posting to our website.\nMaterial changes will be conspicuously posted on our website or otherwise communicated to you.\nThe latest version of the privacy policy is always accessible at www.sanity.io/legal/privacy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nOverview of personal data we collect and use</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.1 Log in information and data you provide as a customer of sanity.io</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In order to use all services offered by Sanity, you are required to register.\nYou may register using third party identity providers, such as Google and Github.\nIf you choose to do so, the identity providers will provide Sanity with your name, email address and profile picture (if available).\nSanity will not, however, have access to your password.\nIf direct signup with Sanity is provided, we will require you to enter your name, email address and password, and you may also provide us with other information upon login, such as your profile picture.\nFor both options, this data is required to create and administer a user account for you and to enable you to use the service.\nFor enterprise customers, Sanity allows signup and login via third party enterprise authentication services, if previously agreed upon and formalized in terms with said enterprise.</p>\n<p>If you decide to use services offered by Sanity that are subject to a charge, you are required to provide the name, address, email address, and phone number of your organization (or yours if not applicable) for payment reasons.\nThis information is also processed by our payment processor.\nCredit card information is never available to Sanity, but is only transmitted to and stored with our payment processor.</p>\n<p>To provide you with a better service, user and organization data may also be stored in third-party CRM systems or similar tools (such as e.g.\nhubspot.com and salesforce.com) for sales and marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>You may choose to download our published whitepapers or sign up for our newsletter and service status updates provided via email.\nWe will store your name and email address, and use this information to send you marketing communications.\nWe will also share this information with third party vendors to deliver these services on our behalf.\nYou may choose to unsubscribe from these email communications at any time.\nWe will also very occasionally send important service updates to all registered users via email, using the same third-party vendors.</p>\n<p>Sanity is the data controller for the personal data of our service users according to relevant data protection law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.2 Information within content owned by our users at sanity.io</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Users can upload a variety of content, such as texts, images, videos and music files to and via the Sanity Services, defined as \"Customer Data\" in our General Terms and Conditions.\nTypical content uploaded to Sanity might be news articles or a shop's production information.\nThis data may occasionally, but not usually, contain data that may be qualified as personal data.\nIn this context, Sanity is only a processor of data on behalf of the user and not the data controller.\nSanity will only process and store this data within the framework of the provision of the service, in the scope described in the General Terms and Conditions and our Agreement with you or the entity with which you are connected to.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.3 Data collected through the use of APIs and SDKs</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sanity allows customers to integrate their uploaded content into their internal systems and/or third-party systems delivered by other parties through an Application Programming Interface (API).\nSanity by design does not determine what systems it may be configured to interoperate with but typical examples of classes of such systems are content delivery (e.g.\nHTML rendering systems, native mobile applications, digital signage systems) and content optimisation (e.g.\ne-commerce personalization services, A/B/N-testing or similar) systems.</p>\n<p>The SDKs can, however, be configured by the user/client of our service to send the identity (user ID) of logged-in users to our APIs in order to facilitate, for example, access control.\nThis would be a user-based decision/parameter defined by client and therefore out of our control.</p>\n<p>Sanity logs the originating IP address of an end user to avoid fraudulent use (e.g., denial of service attack).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.4 Information gathered through automatic data collection</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you access the Sanity Services via a browser, the Command Line Interface (CLI), or other means, certain data is automatically transmitted for technical reasons.\nThe following data is logged and stored separately from any other data you may transmit to us for a limited time: IP address, date and time of access, browser type and version, operating system, URL of the website visited prior to ours, amount of data transmitted, and performance numbers such as latencies and caching.\nThis data is collected for purposes of security, troubleshooting, and aggregate statistics, and is never associated with any particular individual.</p>\n<p>Logged-in users will also transmit authentication information through cookies or headers to allow our systems to authenticate and authorize the request and make decisions based on the logged-in user.\nThis information is never stored together with the access logs mentioned above, but other information that is explicitly provided by the user to perform operations may, however, be logged and associated with the user in order to provide audit logs and similar.</p>\n<p>When visiting our website at sanity.io we collect aggregate statistics about your actions on our website and store these with a third-party processor for analytics and statistics to improve our website and service.\nThe collected data does not include any personal information, and it is not possible for us to trace this back to any individual.</p>\n<p>If the user should encounter any errors while using our services, we will temporarily log information relevant to the error, including the information listed above, with a third party processor in order to notify us of the error and aid with debugging.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>California\u2019s \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d Requirement.\nwe currently do not respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d requests.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.5 Analytics and Marketing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sanity uses Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, web analytics services provided by Google Inc.\n(\"Google\"), for aggregate statistics about our website usage.\nThis also collects information for remarketing purposes.\nThe information gathered is anonymous, and cannot be traced back to individuals.\nTo learn more about how Google uses data, visit Google\u2019s Privacy Policy and Google\u2019s page on \u201cHow Google uses data when you use our partners\u2019 sites or apps.\u201d You may download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on for each web browser you use, but this does not prevent the use of other analytics tools.\nTo learn more about Google Analytics cookies, visit Google Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites.</p>\n<p>When users visit Sanity.io they may choose to opt-in to seeing advertising about Sanity elsewhere on the internet.\nSanity uses Google Marketing Services to allow more targeted ads for our website on sites using Google Display Network and Google Search Ads.\nThis is called \"remarketing\".\nThe user data is processed pseudonymously by Google Marketing Services.&nbsp.\nTo change your preferences with respect to certain online ads or to obtain more information about ad networks and remarketing, visit National Advertising Initiative Consumer opt-out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Program.\nChanging your settings with individual browsers or ad networks will not necessarily carry over to other browsers or ad networks.\nAs a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads.\nOpting-out of targeted advertising does not opt you out of all ads, just those targeted to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.6 Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sanity stores so-called \"cookies\" to provide you with a wide range of functionalities.\n\"Cookies\" are tiny files stored on your computer through your browser.\nIf you do not wish to receive \"cookies\", you may deactivate storing \"cookies\" on your computer by changing your browser settings accordingly.\nPlease note that the functioning of the website may be impaired and the range of functionalities may be limited if you deactivate \"cookies\".\nThe cookies we use are described in more detail in Appendix 1.\nYou may deactivate cookies in your web browser.\nFor more information, please visit http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.7 Further information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you decide to use services offered by Sanity that are subject to a charge, Sanity may offer you the possibility to enter further information and/or flag issues using the customer account management tool on your profile page.\nThe information requested by Sanity will then depend on your request and will be specified in the input mask.\nIn addition, free-text fields allow you to enter more information.\nSanity will use the information you enter to process your request.</p>\n<p>Sanity also offers a free newsletter service.\nIn its newsletter, Sanity informs subscribers about changes to the Sanity Services.\nYou may opt out of the newsletter at any time.\nEach newsletter contains a link to opt out of receiving any future newsletters.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nGeneral Aspects of Data Processing and Privacy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1 Legal basis and purpose of our processing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We process your data because it is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract with you and/or

the legal rights of, Sanity or any other party.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Professional Advisors</strong>.&nbsp.\nWe may share personal data with our professional advisors, such as our attorneys, accountants, financial advisors and business advisors, in their capacity as advisors to Sanity.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Change in Ownership.&nbsp.\n</strong>In the event (a) Sanity is subject to a change of control, (b) our services change ownership, in whole or in part, or (c) of a bankruptcy, receivership or a similar transaction, we may provide personal data to the subsequent owner(s), including as part of any due diligence process.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other.&nbsp.\n</strong>We may share personal data with third parties and/or service providers when explicitly requested by or consented to by you, or for the purposes for which you disclosed the personal data to us as indicated at the time and point of the disclosure (or as was obvious at the time and point of disclosure).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3 Third party access to your data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sanity employs third-party processors under contract as part of providing our services to you, who may process your personal data in cases where we are the data controller.\nIn these cases, we only share the necessary information to enable them to carry out their tasks.\nSuch external service providers are carefully selected in order to ensure your privacy and to fulfil our obligations under the GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable data protection laws.\nService providers may only use the data for the purposes under the agreement entered into between Sanity and the service provider.\nMore information about our specific third-party processors is included at https://www.sanity.io/third-party-sub-processors.</p>\n<p>We also employ a limited number of third-party subprocessors for processing customer-controlled data, listed at https://www.sanity.io/third-party-sub-processors.\nSanity will notify customers before changing subprocessors that have access to customer-controlled data, and allow the customer to cancel their contract before the switch if they object.</p>\n<p>If it serves investigations of illegal use of our services or is required to pursue legal claims, personal data may be shared with law enforcement agencies, public bodies and third-party victims' claims based upon court orders or other binding orders from public bodies.\nSuch transfer of data will be made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>In the last 12 months we have not Sold your personal data and we currently do not Sell personal data.\n\u201cSold\u201d / \"Sell\" has the definition set forth in the CCPA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4 Deletion of your data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your data will be deleted from our systems and third-party processors once it is no longer required for the aforementioned purposes.\nWe delete or anonymize logs within 90 days of collection.\nIf you delete your user account, your personal data will be removed from our systems without unreasonable delay, and at the latest within 90 days, unless applicable legislation or legal process prevents us from doing so.\nTo the extent that Sanity is legally obliged to archive data, such data will be blocked and will not be available for productive use.</p>\n<p>Customer-controlled data may be deleted via our API.\nWe retain a complete history of all changes to a dataset, including deleted documents, with a maximum retention period given by the project's plan.\nCustom retention periods can be configured for the entire dataset or by document type for customers with our custom history retention feature.\nCustomers can also permanently delete a document and all history via a purge mutation through our API.\nNote that user-specified document IDs will be retained in our systems indefinitely (until the entire dataset is deleted), for technical reasons - we strongly recommend that document IDs never contain personal or sensitive data.\nDeleted assets may remain available in public CDN caches until the configured expiry time.</p>\n<p>Data may in certain cases remain in the systems of our subprocessor Google Cloud Platform for as long as 180 days, as outlined in their terms of service, although it will generally be removed much sooner.\nThis data is not available to us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.5 Location of your data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sanity is based in Norway and will primarily access your data from our regular place of business in Norway.\nYour personal data will be stored on servers within the EU/EEA hosted by our subprocessor Google Cloud Platform - primarily in data centers in St.\nGhislain, Belgium, but also at other Google data centers throughout the EU.\nYour data may be stored transiently or cached in any country in which Google or its agents maintain facilities.</p>\n<p>We also employ certain third-party processors outside of the EU (primarily in the US) to deliver our services, which may process personal data for which we are a controller.\nUnder such circumstances, adequate safeguards for such transfer to third countries are in place, including data processing agreements compatible with EU standard clauses accepted by the European Commission.\nFor a complete list of processors, please see https://www.sanity.io/third-party-sub-processors.</p>\n<p>Customer-controlled data is always permanently stored within the EU.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.6 Your rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Subject to certain limitations such as exceptions permitted by applicable law and verification of your identity, you may exercise
