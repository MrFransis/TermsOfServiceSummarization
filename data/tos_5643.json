Times<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Invoices are payable to Ableton immediately upon receipt.\nThe customer agrees to pay the invoice amount at latest within 14 days of receipt of the respective goods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.2.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;The following paragraph only applies to consumers with their main residence in countries where Splitit is offered as an installments payment option and the consumer has chosen Splitit as instalment payment option.<br>\n<br>\na)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;What is Splitit?&nbsp;<br>\nSplitit is a payment solution enabling customers to pay for purchases with an existing Visa or MasterCard credit card by splitting the cost into interest-free monthly payments.</p>\n<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;How does Splitit work?<br>\nCustomers who choose Splitit to pay, understand and agree that Splitit requests authorization from their credit card company, reserving the total purchase amount from their available line of credit.\nWhen customer chooses to pay in installments, the total price of customer\u2019s purchase is blocked from customer\u2019s available credit limit.\nThat means the total amount is held in reserve on customer\u2019s card to ensure payment.\nThe first installment is immediately deducted from customer\u2019s card.\nThen, each month, according to customer\u2019s payment plan, the installment amount is collected and Splitit requests authorization for the remaining balance.\nThe authorization will remain in effect until customer cancels it in writing, in which case customer\u2019s remaining balance becomes due.</p>\n<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Pay the remaining balance in full&nbsp;<br>\nUpon completing customer\u2019s first transaction, customer may pay off customer\u2019s balance early.</p>\n<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Failed authorization / failed payment<br>\nIn case of an authorization being rejected for any reason, customer understands that Ableton may attempt to process the charge again within seven (7) days after notifying customer via e mail.</p>\n<p>In the event that customer fails to pay an instalment for any reason, Ableton may charge customer\u2019s credit card at any time for the full outstanding amount due.<br>\n</p>\n<p>4.3.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Notwithstanding all other rights of Ableton and subject to mandatory legal provisions, if a customer is a consumer, the customer must pay a default interest of 5% per year over the base rate pursuant to \u00a7 247 BGB during the period of default.\nNotwithstanding all other rights of Ableton, if the customer is an entrepreneur, the customer must pay default interest of 9% per year over the base rate pursuant to \u00a7247 BGB during the period of default.\nAbleton retains the right with respect to the entrepreneur to prove and assert a claim for higher default interest damages, and likewise the entrepreneur may proof that lesser damages exist.</p>\n<p>4.4.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Ableton is entitled to offset any claims against the customer.\nAbleton is also entitled to collect claims or have claims collected from the customer\u2019s account, insofar as the customer has agreed hereto.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;If the customer is not a consumer, the customer is only entitled to set off claims against Ableton that are undisputed or claims that have been determined without further legal recourse.\nStatutory binding off-set prohibitions remain unaffected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.5.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;The customer may only exercise its right of retention, when its counter claim is based on the same contractual relationship.</p>\n<p>4.6.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;The customer may only assign its claims under the contract, if the customer receives prior explicit consent from Ableton.\nThe consent may not be unreasonably denied.\n\u00a7 354a HGB remains unaffected.</p>\n<p>4.7.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Ableton shall provide services within the contractually agreed-upon deadlines.\nIf Ableton is prevented from making a timely delivery due to events of force majeure, for example mobilization, war, riot, strike, lockout, fire, natural disasters, transport problems, changes to legal provisions, administrative measures or the occurrence of other unanticipated events not caused by Ableton, the shipping deadlines will be prolonged accordingly.</p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Transfer of Risk<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;If the customer is a consumer, the risk of accidental destruction and accidental deterioration of goods passes to the consumer upon the delivery of goods, in cases of mail orders as well.</p>\n<p>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;If the customer is an entrepreneur, the risk of accidental destruction and accidental deterioration of the product passes to the entrepreneur upon delivery of goods to the carrier, shipper or other person or institution designated to execute the delivery.</p>\n<p>5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;With respect to the download and sending of data over the Internet, the risk of destruction or modification of the data passes to the customer upon the passage of the data over the network interface.</p>\n<p>5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;The delivery is deemed as performed, regardless of whether the customer is in default with their acceptance.</p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Retention of Title<p>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;If the customer is a consumer, Ableton retains title to the goods until full payment of the purchasing price.</p>\n<p>6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;If the customer is an entrepreneur, Ableton retains title to the goods until full settlement of all claims arising from the ongoing business relationship.\nIf the value of the goods retained exceeds the claims arising from the ongoing business relationship by 10%, Ableton is required to release the goods retained at the request of the entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;The customer is obliged to treat the goods with care during the period of retention of title.\nAs long as ownership did not pass to customer, the customer must inform Ableton promptly of all access to the goods made by third parties, in particular of compulsory execution measures under law, as well as any damages or the destruction of the goods, to enable Ableton to enforce its ownership rights.\nThe same applies, if possession of the goods changes or the customer\u2019s address changes.\nThe customer must indemnify Ableton for damages caused by the customer\u2019s breach of this obligation if the third party is not able to reimburse these costs to Ableton.</p>\n<p>6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;If the customer is an entrepreneur, the customer is authorized to resell the goods in the ordinary course of business, also if the goods still belong to Ableton due to existing retention of title.\nThe customer herewith transfers all claims hereto up to the outstanding amount, which accrue against a third party from the sale.\nAbleton accepts the transfer.\nFollowing the transfer, the entrepreneur is authorized to collect the debt.\nThe authorization may be withdrawn at any time, if the entrepreneur does not properly fulfill its obligations to pay and the entrepreneur defaults on payment.&nbsp;<br>\nAny processing or transformation of the goods subject to retention of title by the customer shall be carried out in any case for Ableton.\nIf the goods subject to retention of title are processed with other things not belonging to Ableton, Ableton acquires co-ownership of the new item in the share of the value of the goods subject to retention of title (net invoice amount including VAT) and the other processed things at the time of their processing.\nFor the new object resulting from such processing, the same rules apply as to the goods subject to retention of title.\n&nbsp;<br>\nIn the event of inseparable intermixing of the goods subject to retention of title with other things not belonging to Ableton, Ableton shall acquire co-ownership of the new thing in the share of the value of the goods subject to retention of title (net invoice amount including VAT) and the other intermixed things at the time of the inseparable intermixing.&nbsp;<br>\nIs the thing not belonging to Ableton the main thing of the result of the inseparable intermixing, Ableton and the customer agree that customer will transfer co-ownership to Ableton.\nAbleton hereby accepts the transfer.\nCustomer will keep the thing of which Ableton gained the sole ownership or co-ownership in the described way, free of charge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6.5.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Is the delivery of software part of the subject matter of the contract to purchase hardware in accordance with this clause, Ableton grants to the customer, upon full payment of the purchase price, a permanent, transferable and simple right of use in accordance with the subject of the agreement.\nUntil full payment of the purchase price, Ableton grants to the customer a simple, non-transferable right of use of the software.\nThis right is revocable in case of default of payment.\nThe removal of a copy protection or similar protection routines is permitted, if this protection mechanism impairs or prevents the trouble-free use of the program.\nCopyright notices, serial numbers and other features serving to identify the program may not be removed or changed.&nbsp;</p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Warranty / Push \u2013 Customer Service<p>7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;If the customer is a consumer, the statutory warranty shall apply.<br>\nCustomers residing in the Europe may assert their warranty rights against
