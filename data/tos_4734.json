website browsers<p>If you're <strong>just browsing the website</strong>, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect.\nWe use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs.\nThis is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>\n<p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor\u2019s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request.\nWe also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>Why we collect this<p>We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use GitBook, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.</p>Information from users with accounts<p>If you <strong>create an account</strong>, we require some basic information at the time of account creation.\nYou will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email address.\nYou also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include \"User Personal Information.\"</p>\n<p>\"User Personal Information\" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her.\nInformation such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of \u201cUser Personal Information.\u201d User Personal Information includes Personal Data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>\n<p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information.\nWe may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.</p>Why we collect this<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request, or to respond to support requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on GitBook.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, <strong>and only for the reasons you\u2019ve said that\u2019s okay</strong>.\nPlease see our section on email communication for more information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We use your User Personal Information for internal purposes, such as to maintain logs for security reasons, for training purposes, and for legal documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement.\nIf we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first.\nYou can always see what information we have, how we're using it, and what permissions you have given us in your user profile.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>Our legal basis for processing information<p>Under certain international laws (including GDPR), GitBook is required to notify you about the legal basis on which we process User Personal Information.\nGitBook processes User Personal Information on the following legal bases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When you create a GitBook account, you provide your name and an email address.\nWe require those data elements for you to enter into the Terms of Service agreement with us, and we process those elements on the basis of performing that contract.\nWe also process your user name and email address on other bases.\nIf you have a paid account with us, there will be other data elements we must collect and process on the basis of performing that contract.\nGitBook does not collect or process a credit card number, but our third-party payment processor does.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you fill out the information in your user profile, you have the option to provide User Personal Information such as an avatar which may include a photograph or your biography.\nWe process this information on the basis of consent.\nAll of this information is entirely optional, and you have the ability to access, modify, and delete it at any time (while you are not able to delete your email address entirely, this information is private and not shared with other users).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests.\nFor example, for security purposes, we must keep logs of IP addresses that access GitBook, and in order to respond to legal process, we are required to keep records of users who have sent and received DMCA takedown notices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you would like to request erasure of data we process on the basis of consent or object to our processing of personal information, please contact us support@gitbook.com.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>What information GitBook does not collect<p>We do not intentionally collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information.\nAlthough GitBook does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a space.\nIf you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.</p>\n<p>If you're a <strong>child under the age of 13</strong>, you may not have an account on GitBook.\nGitBook does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13.\nIf we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account.\nWe don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules.\nPlease see our Terms of Service for information about account termination.\nOther countries may have different minimum age limits, and if you are below the minimum age for providing consent for data collection in your country, you may not use GitBook without obtaining your parents' or legal guardians' consent.</p>\n<p>We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is <strong>stored in your spaces</strong> or other free-form content inputs.\nInformation in your spaces belongs to you (and your organization), and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service.\nAny personal information within a user's space is the responsibility of the organization owner.</p>Repository contents<p>GitBook employees do not access private spaces unless required to for security reasons, to assist the space owner with a support matter, or to maintain the integrity of the service.\nOur Terms of Service provides more details.</p>\n<p>If your space is public or unlisted, anyone (including us and unaffiliated third parties) may view its contents.\nIf you have included private or sensitive information in your public repository, such as email addresses or passwords, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.\nIn addition, while we do not generally search for content in your spaces, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures, or for known active malware.</p>\n<p>Please see more about User Personal Information in public repositories.</p>How we share the information we collect<p>We do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf.\nAdditionally, you may indicate, through your actions on GitBook, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information.\nFor example, if you join an organization, the owner of the organization will have the ability to view your activity in the organization's access log.\nWe will respect your choices.</p>\n<p>We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.</p>\n<p>We <strong>do not</strong> host advertising on GitBook.\nWe may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads.\nWhile we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show.\nAny advertisements on individual GitBook Pages or in GitBook spaces are not sponsored by, or tracked by, GitBook.</p>\n<p>We <strong>do not</strong> disclose User Personal Information outside GitBook, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on Compelled Disclosure.</p>\n<p>We <strong>do</strong> share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use GitBook, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events.\nHowever, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.</p>\n<p>We <strong>do</strong> share User Personal Information with a limited number of third party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement by signing data protection agreements.\nOur vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services.\nWhen we transfer your data to our vendors, we remain responsible for it.\nWhile GitBook processes all User Personal Information in the United States, our third party vendors may process data outside of the United States or the European Union.</p>\n<p>We do share aggregated, non-personally identifying information with third parties.</p>\n<p>We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition.\nIf any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information.\nThe organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.</p>Public information on GitBook<p>Much of GitBook is public-facing.\nIf your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing your spaces or pulling data via our API.\nWe do not sell that content.\nit is yours.\nHowever, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing GitBook information.\nOther third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape GitBook and compile data as well.</p>\n<p>Your Personal Information, associated with your content, could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of GitBook data.\nIf you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties\u2019 compilations of GitBook data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your user profile.</p>\n<p>If you would like to compile GitBook data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding [scraping and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it.\nFor example, where a GitBook user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising.\nWe expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitBook, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitBook or GitBook users.</p>\n<p>Similarly, projects on GitBook may include publicly available Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process.\nIn the event that a GitBook project contains publicly available Personal Information that does not belong to GitBook users, we will only use that Personal Information for the limited purpose for which it was collected, and we will secure that Personal Information as we would secure any User Personal Information.\nIf you have a complaint about any Personal Information on GitBook, please see our section on resolving complaints.</p>Third party applications<p>You have the option of enabling or adding third party applications, known as \"Developer Products,\" to your account.\nThese Developer Products are not necessary for your use of GitBook.\nWe will share your User Personal Information to third parties when you ask us to.\nhowever, you are responsible for your use of the third party Developer Product and for the amount of User Personal Information you choose to share with it.\nYou can check our API documentation to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitBook profile.</p>GitBook applications<p>You also have the option of adding applications from GitBook, such as a Desktop app, a Mobile app, or other account features, to your account.\nThese applications each have their own terms and may collect different kinds of User Personal Information.\nhowever, all GitBook applications are subject to this Privacy Statement, and we will always collect the minimum amount of User Personal Information necessary, and use it only for the purpose for which you have given it to us.</p>How you can access and control the information we collect<p>If you're already a GitBook user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or contacting support@gitbook.com.\nYou can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by updating out of date information, or by contacting support@gitbook.com.</p>Data retention and deletion<p>Generally, GitBook will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.</p>\n<p>We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion.\nFor example, we don\u2019t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely.</p>\n<p>If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your user profile.\nWe will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your

integrity, access, and recourse we provide.\nWe have appointed a Privacy Counsel and we work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business, and we also expect to appoint a Data Protection Officer to oversee our compliance efforts.\nAdditionally, if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them to comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws.</p>\n<p>In particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GitBook provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data
