ACTION WAIVER\u2013IMPORTANT\u2013PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.1.\nBinding Arbitration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\nEither party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below.\nSpecifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties\u2019 relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</p>\n<p>b.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>c.\nThe Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1.800.352.5267.\nTo the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Company will pay the additional cost.\nIf the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Company will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000.\nThe arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney\u2019s fees in certain cases.\nThe parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nThey further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.2 Location</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\nIf you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you.\nFor residents in Canada, arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, and you and Company agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.3 Class Action Waiver</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\nThe parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.\nYOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.4 Exception\u2013Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\nNotwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (\"intellectual property rights\" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).\nEither party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.5 30-Day Right to Opt Out</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\nYou have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Intermedia Labs, Inc., 138 Spring Street, New York, New York 10012.\nThe notice must be sent within 30 days of 04/20/2018 or your first use of the Service, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs.\nIf you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Company also will not be bound by them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.6 Changes to this Section</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\nCompany will provide 60-days\u2019 notice of any changes to this section.\nChanges will become effective on the 60th day, and will apply prospectively only to any claims arising after the 60th day.</p>\n<p>b.\nFor any dispute not subject to arbitration you and Company agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, NY.\nYou further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.</p>\n<p>c.\nThe Terms and the relationship between you and Company shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong>.\nThese Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York,
