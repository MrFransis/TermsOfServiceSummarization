indicate your agreement to these Terms by clicking or tapping on a button indicating your acceptance of these Terms, by executing a document that references them, or by using Badgr.</p>\nTERMS OF SERVICE\n1.\nTHE BADGR SERVICE.\n<p>\n<strong>1.1 Description.</strong> Badgr is an online platform to create, curate, issue, receive, explore, and share Badges.\nUsers can access tools to issue Badges to learners and other persons eligible to receive a Badge (each a \u201cBadge Recipient\u201d), as well as associated administrative tools and services.\nBadge Recipients and other individuals eligible to receive a Badge can utilize Badgr to receive, organize and display Badges).\nBadgr also includes features that integrate with products and services offered by third parties to facilitate the micro-credentialing process and the sharing of Badges.\nFor example, the Badgr Pathways tool allows users to interact with Badges from other Open Badge Specification compliant platforms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.2 Open Badges.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>a.</strong> Badges are based on the Open Badge Specification developed through the work of IMS Global Learning Consortium, Inc.\n(\u201cIMS Global\u201d) and its members, including CSky.\nCSky expects all users to respect the Open Badge Specification.\nCSky plays no role in determining the value or veracity of a Badge, and CSky does not endorse or vouch for the qualifications of any Badge Recipient.\nThe issuer of a Badge is solely responsible for determining the value and veracity of each Badge and the qualifications of each prospective Badge Recipient.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b.</strong> In 2020 IMS Global launched the Badge Connect\u2122 API open standard, an initiative that was developed in partnership with its members, including CSky.\nAs a supporter of the Badge Connect standard, CSky allows third parties to send Badges between Badgr and third-party services on behalf of Badge Recipients.\nThe third party accessing Badgr for such purposes is solely responsible for obtaining the Badge Recipient\u2019s consent in advance of accessing Badgr for such purposes and for ensuring it shares the Badge Recipient\u2019s Badges only with third-party services the Badge Recipient has expressly authorized.\nAny third party accessing Badgr to facilitate Badge sharing must have a Business Account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c.</strong> When a Badge is issued by the owner of a Business Account, pursuant to the Open Badge Specifications, Badgr creates a publicly available webpage for the Badge.\nThis means the Badge and the associated Badge meta-data automatically becomes publicly available information upon issuance.\nIn addition, once a Badge is issued, that Badge becomes sharable at the discretion of the Badge Recipient.\nNotwithstanding this change in status, an issuer of a Badge always has the ability to correct Badge information or delete a Badge through its Business Account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.3 Eligibility.</strong> You may only access and use Badgr if you can form a binding contract with CSky and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws.\nYou must be 13 years old or older to use Badgr.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.4 Changes to Badgr.</strong> We reserve the right to modify or discontinue Badgr (or any part or feature thereof) with or without notice.\nFor example, we may change Badgr\u2019s pricing at any time or add new fees and charges from time to time, but will provide notice to you of these changes via information on the Site.\nYou acknowledge that CSky may establish general practices and limits concerning use of Badgr, including, without limitation, the maximum period of time that data or other content will be retained on our servers.\nCSky shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of Badgr.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.5 Prohibited Uses.</strong> Except for access to facilitate Badge sharing under the Badge Connect\u2122 API open standard as described in Section 1.2.b.\nabove or where you have otherwise received express permission from CSky, you are at all times prohibited from accessing or otherwise using the Site: (a) to build a competitive product or service or (b) in conjunction with any other services that you sell or otherwise monetize.\nYou are at all times prohibited from circumventing, or attempting to circumvent, any limitations that we impose on your account, Badgr Content, or other services provided through the Site, including without limitation the Badgr APIs.</p>\n2.\nACCOUNT MANAGEMENT.\n<p>\n<strong>2.1 Registered Users.</strong> Some Badgr features are only available if you register a user account.\nUsers who register an account (each a \u201cRegistered User\u201d) have access to additional features and functions of the Site, for example, only Registered Users can create, curate, and issue Badges.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2 Account Owner.</strong> The person registering for Badgr is the owner of such Badgr account (\u201cAccount Owner\u201d), provided that if you are registering for Badgr on behalf of an organization, such organization shall be the Account Owner of the Business Account (\u201cBusiness Account Owner\u201d).\nIf you are registering for Badgr on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind such organization to these Terms and in such case \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d as used in these Terms refers to that organization.\nA \u201cBusiness Account\u201d is a Badgr account created on behalf of and maintained by an organization and which is used for non-personal reasons (i.e.\nnot used solely for receiving Badges).\nExamples of the types of organizations that might have a Business Account are: a corporation or other for-profit business entity, a public institution, such as a university or state agency, a public charity, and a private foundation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3 Registered User Types.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>a.\nBadge Recipient.</strong> A Badge Recipient must become a Registered User before it can use Badgr to share any Badges issued within Badgr.\nTo register, the following information is typically required: email, first name, last name/family name.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b.\nBusiness Account User Types.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(1) Administrator.</strong> The Business Account Owner shall designate one or more administrators who shall have full access to, and administration rights over, all areas of the Site available to the Business Account Owner (\u201cAdministrator\u201d).\nThe Business Account Owner may change the Administrators at any time through the Site.\nThe Administrator must also be a Registered User.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(2) Editors and Staff Members.</strong> \u201cEditors\u201d are mid-level administrators who may create, edit, delete, and issue Badges.\n\u201cStaff Members\u201d are minimum-level administrators who can issue Badges that have been created by the Administrator or Editors.\nThe Administrator may choose to designate one or more Editors and/or Staff Members.\nEditors and Staff Members must also be Registered Users.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4 Registration.</strong> If you choose to register for a user account, you agree to provide
