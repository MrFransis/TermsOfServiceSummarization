Mobile Applications (FUL, ADV, OPS, SEC) <ul>\n<li>Macy's offers mobile applications that you may download from your phone or smart device's \"app store\" as well as apps that you can download from your Internet-connected devices (e.g., smart television).</li>\n<li>Macy's mobile applications, with your permission, may use your device's camera, microphone, or location information to enable features or services.\nFor example, geolocation (e.g., GPS) can help you find a nearby store or learn about upcoming nearby store events.\nAnother example is in-store locations using Bluetooth signals to connect to our Beacons or our In-Store Wi-Fi Services, which can help you while inside our store to find nearby products or receive real-time offers.</li>\n<li>Macy's Mobile Application Preferences

beacon.\nBeacons do not collect or pull in personal data.\nthey only push out radio signal pulses to map nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices, much in the same way radar works.\nIn-app permissions, such as permission to access location and accept Push Notifications (sometimes shown as 'PNS' on your devices), must be enabled for a Beacon to interact with your specific Bluetooth-enabled device.\nInteractions with and notifications delivered to your device may include customer service information, in-store directions, offers and advertisements from Macy's as well as other non-Macy's

Service include: <ul>\n<li> Information about your device, including a MAC Address, and telemetry data (such as signal strength and quality) related to your use of our Wi-Fi service.\n</li>\n<li> Vendors that analyze Wi-Fi data automatically collected to provide operational insights such as foot traffic volumes, dwell times, and how costumers move through our stores.\n</li>\n</ul> Unless we receive consent to use Wi-Fi data in a manner that identifies you or your device(s), Wi-Fi data is anonymously collected or de-identified.\n&nbsp.\nRFID (FUL, OPS, SEC) <ul>\n<li>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags consist of a small chip and antenna that provide a unique identifier for objects.\nRFID serves the same purpose as a bar code and must be scanned by a specific type of reader in close proximity to the tag to retrieve tag data.\nMacy's uses RFID for inventory management (such as locating shoes in the stock room) and logistics support.\nRFID is not used to track or monitor any items once you leave our stores.</li>\n</ul> Video Cameras (FUL, OPS, SEC) <ul>\n<li>We use cameras in our stores for security purposes, loss prevention, and asset protection.\nWe also use cameras in our stores for operational purposes, such as such as traffic pattern analysis.\nCameras may include technology to capture demographic information, such as age, gender and dwell time.</li>\n<li>We will not use cameras to personally identify you, without your consent, except when the identification is for security, anti-theft, or law enforcement purposes.</li>\n</ul> Voice-Enabled Services (FUL, OPS) <ul>\n<li>We may use voice-enabled services (VES) to provide you greater functionality and easier shopping experiences with services such as voice search for products

within any individual Macy's account.\nVoice files will be retained by Macy's and any third party voice-enabled service providers.</li>\n<li>Voice-enabled services are opt-in by use.\nIf you do not wish to opt-in to VES, do not use those features.\nVES do not include phone answering machine messages.</li>\n</ul> &nbsp.\nBack to top &nbsp.\nManaging your preferences This section details, in one
