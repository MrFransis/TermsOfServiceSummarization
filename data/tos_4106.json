process your personal information where we have legal grounds to do so.\nThe legal grounds for processing differ depending on which of our products and services you use.\nGenerally, we\u2019ll only process your data on the following grounds:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>you have given consent for the processing.\nWhen we rely on consent to process your personal information, you always have the right to

adverts more effectively and to promote our services.\nTherefore, we use your personal information to understand and analyse use of our products and services.\nIn certain limited circumstances you have the right to object to processing based on such legitimate interests (as explained in the <b>\"What are your rights?\" </b>section below).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>Legal grounds for processing and

interests</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>\n<b>Purposes of processing</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We have set out our legitimate interests in more detail in the next section below</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>Processing Based on Legitimate Interests<p>Where any of the activities set out below involve the use of cookies or similar technologies, additional information (including about how you can disable them) is displayed to you before such cookies are installed and can also be found in our Cookie Policy at&nbsp;www.itv.com/cookies.</p>Legitimate Interests<p>\n<b>Understanding our audience and use of our products and services:\n</b>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in analysing and understanding how people are using and responding to our products and services at an individual and household or broader level.</p>\n<p>For example, we collect and analyse data about how you are using our products and services and we (or our authorised third parties) may contact you from time to time to ask you to participate in surveys or research projects to help us understand use of and improve our services.\n</p>\n<p>If you use a product or service we may combine information we collect from that product and service with information we collect from our other products and services, with information from surveys and research and with information which is available publicly or from other reputable sources (which include other broadcasters or trusted providers (such as Konica Minolta Marketing Services Limited and the advertising technology provider The Addressable Platform Limited)).\nWe work with trusted third parties (including advertising clients and research providers) to understand the effectiveness of advertising (for example, what actions result from viewing advertising).</p>\n<p>We apply modelling techniques to the information we hold to model our audiences based on certain attributes, understand our viewers better and to analyse use across all of our products and services.\n</p>\n<p>We also collect information and insights information from use and interactions with pages or accounts we operate on third party platforms (for example, Facebook Fan Pages) for this purpose and also to administer those pages or accounts.\nIn relation to such insights data, both we and the third party platform are controllers of any insights data relating to that page or account.\nFor Facebook fan pages we are required to enter into a contract with Facebook to reflect joint controllership.\nYou can download this contract here: https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum.\nIt contains further details and explanations on the joint controllership with Facebook in the context of fan page insights.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Making your user experience more relevant to you including recommendations &amp.\neditorial content personalisation:</b>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in tailoring your user experience to you and making it easier for you to find the shows and content that you enjoy.\nWe therefore use information we hold about you in order to recognise you across our different services, recommend content to you or personalise your experience.\nFor example, we may use this information to help make your sign-in experience quicker and easier and if you watch a lot of drama then we might recommend the next big new drama series to you.\n</p>\n<p>If you have adjusted the \u2018Personalisation\u2019 settings in the \u2018Manage Account\u2019 section of our website, your user experience won\u2019t be personalised.\nWe may still recommend content to you but our recommendations won\u2019t be as relevant for you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Advertising on our products and services:</b>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>Some of our products and services are funded by the sale of advertising and are free for viewers to use.\nWe and our advertisers have a legitimate interest in serving and measuring our advertising efficiently.\nThis is to ensure that our viewers have a good user experience, (for example don\u2019t see the same advertising over and over again) and to allow our advertisers to reach more viewers and know when ads have been served.\n</p>\n<p>If you download any of our apps on a mobile device with a Google Android or Apple iOS operating system then you will be given an advertising identifier by that operating system.\nWe use and pass this identifier to permitted third parties for frequency capping to limit repetitive advertising, for analytics purposes, or to enable us to serve you advertisements of particular relevance to you.\nYou can reset your advertising ID at any time using the settings on your mobile device.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Making advertising on our products and services more relevant to you:</b>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>Some of our products and services are funded by the sale of advertising and are free for viewers to use.\nWe therefore have a legitimate interest in using information we hold about you to help us sell our advertising on a more personalised basis and to show you adverts that we think you\u2019ll be interested in or which are more relevant to you.\nFor example, if you live in Leeds then we would be more likely to show an ad for an event in Yorkshire - and less likely to see an ad for an event in London.\n</p>\n<p>We also pass an identifier relating to you and data about you to The Addressable Platform Limited (an advertising technology provider which is part of the ITV group) and to our trusted third party partners (such as Amobee Inc and GroupM UK Limited (who also work with Finecast Limited)) to enable them to match against other data they may legally hold and use that combined information to serve ads of particular relevance to you.</p>\n<p>You can choose not to receive adverts on our products and services that are tailored using information about you by adjusting the \u2018Personalisation\u2019 settings in the \u2018Manage Account\u2019 section of the ITV Hub website.\nYou\u2019ll still see adverts, but they will be generic (which includes advertising served against content being watched) and less relevant to you.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Making advertising and marketing on other services more relevant to you:</b>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>Our advertising clients run campaigns across more than one service.\nWe and our advertisers have a legitimate interest in making sure that you don\u2019t see repetitive or less relevant advertising across both our platforms and those run by third parties.\nWe therefore share limited data with third parties to enable a match where you have also already shared your data with that party in the course of using their service.\nand (where there is a match) additional data to enable the third party and us to make advertising more relevant to you.\n</p>\n<p>We also work with third party advertisers and platforms (such as Facebook and Google) to advertise our products and services to the most relevant audiences.\nThis can involve the provision of protected ID data (for example, an email address which is converted into a stream of numbers or letters (aka hashed) to help make it more secure) to match the data we hold about you with the data they hold on their platform and provide you with relevant advertising (subject to your ad permissions on the relevant platform).\n</p>\n<p>If you have adjusted the \u2018Personalisation\u2019 settings in the \u2018Manage Account\u2019 section of the ITV Hub website, you may still see adverts and marketing from us on other services, but it won\u2019t use this data.\nAdvertising on other services may still be based on cookie data however unless you have chosen to disable your cookies on the relevant device.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Geo-blocking:</b>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>Some of our content is only available in certain parts of the world.\nThis is due to a range of legal and regulatory issues, and we have a legitimate interest in complying with these restrictions.\nTo ensure we only show you content when you\u2019re in the appropriate territories we detect the IP address of your device to work out your location.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Main channel region:</b>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in complying with our obligations to Ofcom and STV with respect to certain ITV main channel programming in STV\u2019s broadcast regions.\nWe therefore use your postcode or other location data to ensure that we only play out content for you in accordance with those obligations.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Storing payment details for repeat purchases:</b>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>If you purchase or subscribe to an event or service online then we have a legitimate interest to store your payment details to enable you to make repeat purchases without having to re-enter your details again.\nFor example ITV Box Office stores payment details to enable Sky customers to make repeat purchases via their remote control.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Direct Marketing:</b>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>Subject to your direct marketing preferences, we have a legitimate interest in sending you marketing communications that we think will be the most relevant to you (and which will include our own or third party data).\nWe also have a legitimate interest to analyse the performance of our communications.\nFor more details on direct marketing, see below.\n</p>\n<p>If you have adjusted the \u2018Personalisation\u2019 settings in the \u2018Manage Account\u2019 section of our website, we will still send you direct marketing communications (subject to your preferences) but they won\u2019t be as relevant for you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Queries and complaints handling:</b>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>When you contact us with queries and questions about our programmes or services we have a legitimate interest to try to resolve your issue and to keep track of our progress in resolving your issue.\nIn some cases, we may need to verify your details before we can resolve your issue e.g.\nto find your ITV Hub account.</p>\n<p>When you contact us with feedback, we have a legitimate interest to pass your feedback on to the relevant team within ITV if appropriate, or to the production company if your feedback relates to a programme that is not produced by ITV and if it is appropriate.</p>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in monitoring our communications to improve our customer services.\n</p>\nDirect MarketingWe use your data to promote or market our or third party products or services to you via direct marketing in the following circumstances.\n<p>\n<b>Why we send you marketing: At your request</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you have asked us to send you marketing messages about ITV and/or selected third party products, services and special offers or you agree to receive marketing messages from selected third parties (e.g.\nby ticking a box when you register for a product/service or allowing push notifications when you download one of our apps).\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>\n<b>How to control the marketing we send to you:</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You can stop receiving email, SMS or MMS marketing communications from us, by using the 'unsubscribe', 'stop' or similar facility contained in any such communication.\nPlease note that texting STOP in response to our SMS marketing will cost one standard network rate message.\nAlternatively, you can email us at the email address set out in \u2018Contact us\u2019 below stating that you do not wish to receive further communications from us.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can stop receiving push notifications from one of our apps by turning these off at any time by adjusting the settings on your device or deleting the app from your device.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you agree that we can pass data to third party for their marketing purposes, you\u2019ll need to contact the applicable third party to opt-out of receiving communications from that third party.\nPlease note that we are not responsible for the communications you receive from any such third party.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Why we send you marketing: You have participated in one of our paid-for services</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you participated in one of our paid for services such as competitions, prize draws, votes, polls or other interactivity by SMS text message, or have signed up for an ITV Box Office event, and have not opted out of receiving marketing then we will send you marketing messages in relation to similar products or services to those you interacted with (for example, if you enter a competition relating to I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!, we may send you marketing messages in relation to the competition in the following year of I\u2019m a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!).\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>\n<b>How to control the marketing we send to you:</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are participating in our interactivity you can avoid receiving these communications entirely by adding NO INFO at the end of your SMS text entry, vote, poll or other message.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are currently receiving these communications and would prefer not to, you can use the 'unsubscribe', 'stop' or similar facility described in any such communication.\nPlease note that texting STOP in response to our SMS marketing will cost one standard network rate message.\nAlternatively, you can email us at the email address set out in \u2018Contact us\u2019 below stating that you do not wish to receive further communications from us\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>Do we use cookies?<p>We, and our authorised third parties,

keep some personal information about you so we can deal with any complaints you might make about the products and services we provide to you;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>if you ask us to stop processing your personal information for direct marketing, we need to retain enough information about you to enable us to ensure we stop including you in those direct marketing activities;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>we need to keep personal information so we can defend possible future legal claims.\nUnless there\u2019s some other reason for keeping it, personal information will be deleted when such a claim could no longer arise or it is no longer required in order to defend legal claims that have arisen;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>we have a legal or regulatory duty to retain particular personal information for a certain minimum period (for example under Ofcom rules, or under HMRC tax rules).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>In what circumstances do we share your information?<p>We do need to share your personal data with

guarantee that it will meet the standards that content produced by us would ordinarily meet.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>any views expressed in User Generated Content do not necessarily reflect our views.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consequently we do not accept any responsibility or liability for User Generated Content or any actions or omissions that you may take in reliance on it.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What additional terms apply to content submitted by you?</b>If you wish to submit any contribution to the Services or upload any content such as any text (including, for instance, on any chat rooms or forums or on any classified pages), photographs, graphics, video or audio to the Services (\"Submission\"), you agree that any Submission you make is subject to our General Participation Terms at https://www.itv.com/terms/articles/participation-charity/itv-general-participation-terms.Please note that we cannot accept any Submission containing any music, save where expressly permitted by us.</p>OTHER IMPORTANT POINTS TO NOTE ABOUT OUR SERVICES<p>\n<b>Am I watching ITV channels on the Platforms at the same time as broadcast channels live?</b>By viewing our channels on a Platform, you may experience a delayed service compared to the broadcast TV service.\nWhere we are streaming our channels over the internet or a mobile/wifi network, technically it is not possible to operate a live service, but this service is as near live as possible.\nPlease bear this delay in mind, particularly when interacting with our programmes, and please rely on our broadcast TV service for accurate times.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Can you enter competitions and register votes in \"On-Demand\" Programmes?</b>Our catch-up and archive programmes are not live.\nPlease ignore any calls for interaction such as competitions, votes or quizzes.\nIf you do try to participate, your interaction may not be counted but you may still be charged.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Are my details kept safe?</b>We use security measures to keep details you have provided to us safe but we advise that you never reveal to others via the Services any personal information about yourself or anyone else (for example: telephone number, home address or email address).\nYou are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your details when using our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Is payment required to use the Services?</b>We may require payment as a condition of the provision of some of our Services.\nIf we do require payment we will make this clear.\nWe will not commence the provision of those Services until you have indicated your agreement to payment of the required charge or charges.</p>\n<p>Nothing on our Platforms constitutes a formal offer to provide the Services.\nWe may at any time decide not to provide the Services at all or we may change the basis on which we are willing to provide the Services.\nAll items are subject to availability.\nAny prices displayed are subject to change at any time unless we specifically state that they will apply for a particular length of time.\nExcept if there has been an error, the price will be as stated on the Services and will include VAT (where applicable).\nWe try to make sure our prices are accurate but if there has been an error we will usually reject your order and let you know that we have done so.\nWe will not change the price of any Services after we have confirmed your order for the relevant Services.\nPayment methods are as specified on the relevant Services.\nIf you provide us with credit or debit card details, you confirm that you are authorised to use that card.</p>\n<p>By submitting a request to purchase our Services you will be submitting an offer to contract and we will only be deemed to have accepted your offer (and so create a legally binding contract between you and us) if we send you confirmation or if we start to provide the Services (for instance by commencing a download of digital content).Because of the nature of certain Services, the provision of the Services may commence immediately or shortly after you have placed your order.\nThis will, for example (but not if we specifically state otherwise), be the case where the Services consist of providing downloads of digital content to you or allowing you to access our content (even if you do not in fact access or use that content).\nConsequently you acknowledge and agree that, where the provision of the Services commences upon order confirmation, you will have no right to cancel your purchase.\nFurthermore you agree that, following confirmation of your order, your purchase is final, non-exchangeable and non-refundable.\nIf your item is faulty, incorrect or incomplete please contact us so that we can investigate and if appropriate arrange a replacement or refund (at our sole discretion).</p>\n<p>If the Service that you are purchasing involves the download of a specific piece of content (for example an app or an on-demand programme) and, following confirmation of your order by us that content becomes unavailable or the completion of the download is unsuccessful as a result of our technological failure, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by us.\nYou agree that you will have no remedy against us if the download does not successfully complete as a result of any factors outside of our reasonable control (including without limitation any technological failure of the device that you are using to download the content).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Can you link to our Website?</b>You may link your website to the home page of our Website, provided that you own that website and that you do so in a way that is fair, legal and does not take advantage of or damage our reputation and any such link is for non-commercial purposes.\nAny such link must not, suggest or in any way give the impression that you have any commercial relationship with us, or that we have approved or endorsed such link.\nYou may not create a link to any part of our Website other than the home page.\nWe reserve the right to withdraw permission to link to the home page of our Website at any time without notice at our sole and absolute discretion.\nYou may not \"deep-link\" to pages beyond the home page without our express permission.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Can you frame our Website?</b>You may not frame our Website on other websites without our express permission.</p>THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND SERVICES<p>\n<b>Do third parties provide content and services on our Platforms?</b>Please note that certain pages and services provided as part of the Services are hosted, managed and operated by a third party.\nWhere this is the case it will normally be indicated on the Website and/or the relevant Service.\nThe Services may contain links to other third party websites, platforms and services through advertising or otherwise, and in certain circumstances our content may also be made available on third party services and platforms (\"Distributed Content\").</p>\n<p>\n<b>Who is responsible for third party content and services?</b>These third parties are companies wholly independent of us and are solely responsible for all aspects of any transaction you may make using such services.\nThese third parties may have their own privacy policies and/or terms and conditions of use.\nYour use of such third party websites and services will be governed by their terms and conditions and privacy policies, we therefore recommend you read such terms and conditions and privacy policies and you agree to comply with them.\nFor the contact details of the applicable third party see that third party's terms and conditions available or referred to on the applicable Platform.</p>\n<p>You are free to choose whether or not to make use of such third party services.\nConsequently we do not accept any responsibility or liability for content incorporated in our Services in this way or any actions or omissions that you may take in reliance on it.\nWe are not responsible for the contents (including the Distributed Content) or availability of such third party websites or services (including the failure of any links to them).\nWe do not endorse the material contained in their websites or services.\nAny links to third party services are provided for your convenience only.</p>\n<p>If you use a third party service, you agree that: (i) we won't be party to any transaction or contract with a third party that you may enter into (which may include, but is not limited to, a transaction or contract where the third party sells or otherwise provides Distributed Content, or access to Distributed Content, to you pursuant to that transaction or contract).\n(ii) we will not be supplying those services (including, where applicable, any Distributed Content) to you.\nand (iii) we won't be liable to you for any loss or damage which you may suffer by using those third party websites and/or services (including any use by you of Distributed Content).\nYou agree that you will not involve ITV in any dispute you may have with such third party websites and services</p>OTHER GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY<p>\n<b>Where are these Terms available?</b>These Terms are available on the Website.\nWe will not file or store a copy of these Terms for each interaction or transaction by you via the Website or the Services.\nWe therefore recommend that you print and store or save a copy of these Terms for future reference.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Can you transfer your rights under these Terms?</b>You may not assign, sub-license or otherwise transfer any or your rights or obligations set out in these Terms to any other person.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Can a third party enforce these Terms?</b>These terms do not create any rights that are enforceable by any person who is not a party to these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What happens if we do not enforce a right under these Terms against you?</b>If we decide not to exercise or enforce a right that we have against you (e.g.\nas a result of you breaching these Terms), this does not prevent us from doing so at a later date.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What happens if part of these Terms is not enforceable?</b>If any provision of these Terms is found by any court or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable then that invalid or unenforceable part will be deemed deleted from these Terms, such invalidity or unenforceability will not affect the other provisions of these Terms and they will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What happens if there is a dispute about these Terms?</b>These Terms are available in English only and are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England (or the laws of Scotland if you are domiciled there).\nDisputes arising in connection with these Terms are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales unless you choose the jurisdiction of your domicile in Scotland or Northern Ireland.</p>DETAILS OF WHO TO CONTACT<p>If you have any questions, queries or complaints then you can email us at itvhubhelp@itv.com or using the contact form found at
