Has Been Included in a Notice and Takedown Report\u2028<br>Filing a Counter Notice\u2028</p>\n<p>\n<br>Intellectual Property and Publicity Rights</p>\n<p>Redbubble is a community built on respect and recognition of artists.\nWe ask, rather we beg, that you remember this when you are posting work on Redbubble.\nIf you make sure that all the works you upload consist of your very own, original ideas and are not infringing on the intellectual property or publicity rights of another, you will help us foster the supportive and creative environment that is Redbubble.\nAND, besides being counter to all that Redbubble stands for, stealing other people\u2019s work and passing it off as your own is against the law:</p>\n<p>There are several international treaties that relate to intellectual property, but the laws are not uniform across the world.\nHowever, generally speaking\u2026</p>\n<p>\n<strong>COPYRIGHT</strong> law protects the expression of an original idea recorded in a tangible form, such as artwork in the form of photographs or paintings and literary works in the form of poems or stories.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>TRADEMARK</strong> law protects the use of words, symbols, designs or logos that identify and distinguish a source of goods.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PUBLICITY RIGHTS</strong> protect an individual\u2019s name, image and likeness.\nBasically this means you can\u2019t use someone else\u2019s identity, to your commercial advantage, without their consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A NOTE ON FAIR USE</strong>: You might be able to incorporate someone else's copyright or trademark into your own work, if you do it in such a way that that is considered \"fair use\" or in such a way that qualifies as another permissible use.\nHowever, please be aware that \u201cfair use\u201d typically applies in limited circumstances and isn\u2019t the same as \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d.\nQuite frankly \u201cfair use\u201d is a difficult concept, even for the experts, and the scope of \u201cfair use\u201d is different in different countries.\nSo even if you think you\u2019ve created a work covered by \u201cfair use\u201d or another permissible use, you should talk to an attorney prior to using it in connection with the Redbubble service.\nWhile some uses might appear \u201cfair\u201d or permissible to you, we ask that you understand that Redbubble must act in accordance with its Notice and Takedown procedure when a report has been received.\nAdditionally, certain works may be taken down without a specific report being received if we are otherwise alerted or aware of potential infringement issues.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, you take full responsibility for the works you upload and display on Redbubble.\nThis is reflected in the Redbubble User Agreement.\nUse of the Redbubble website indicates continued acceptance of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>So please do us all a favour and if someone has created or owns the rights to a picture, painting, photograph, logo, story, poem or any other work, copyright, trademark or publicity right (regardless of whether it\u2019s an individual or a large global company), obtain consent before you use that work in connection with the Redbubble service.\nThis will help ensure that you don\u2019t infringe the rights of any third party and help us promote an encouraging and inspired environment at Redbubble filled with wit, soul, meaning and aesthetic genius.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>REPEAT INFRINGER POLICY</strong>: It is Redbubble\u2019s policy, in appropriate circumstances, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly infringe or are repeatedly charged with infringing the copyrights, trademark rights, other intellectual property rights or publicity rights of others.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Notice and Takedown Procedure - Reports and Complaints</p>\n<p>Redbubble respects the intellectual property rights of others and we ask our users to do the same.</p>\n<p>If you believe that your content has been used in a way that constitutes an infringement of your rights, please notify Redbubble's designated agent for complaints (submit form below) by sending a Notice and Takedown Report, which must

Report</p>\n<p>If the Redbubble Content Team has received a Notice and Takedown Report which specifically notes one or more of your works, the noted works will have been removed.\nYou will not be able

- Services Agreement <p>You wish to use Redbubble\u2019s services to facilitate marketing and sale of your art on a physical product and to arrange for manufacture of the physical product (\"your product\") once an order has been made through www.redbubble.com (\"the website\").\nRedbubble will provide these services on the terms set out in this Services Agreement.\nAdditionally, Redbubble will provide for delivery of such products to the customer.</p> 1.\nServices <p>1.1 Redbubble, acting as independent contractor under your instructions in relation to the performance of marketplace services, will market to and obtain orders from customers for the purchase of your products over the website and on instruction from you.\nRedbubble will arrange for third parties to fulfil those orders by facilitating payment for and manufacture of your products (\u201cServices\u201d).\nRedbubble will then arrange for the delivery of your products as per the customer\u2019s instructions.\nWhilst Redbubble\u2019s capacity is one of independent contractor in relation to the Services, it acts your agent specifically in relation to the sales transaction between you and the customer who buys your product \u2013 see further clause 5.2 below.</p>\n<p>1.2 Redbubble will provide the Services pursuant to this agreement until termination in accordance with its terms.</p>\n<p>1.3 You agree that Redbubble is free to act in any capacity for any other person interested in promoting, marketing and obtaining orders from members of the public for the purchase of their arts over the website, including any art that is the same as, or similar to, your products.</p> 2.\nLicense and standing instructions <p>2.1 You grant Redbubble a non-exclusive royalty free license to use your intellectual property relating to your products for the purpose of enabling us to carry out the Services.\n</p>\n<p>2.2 You hereby instruct Redbubble to facilitate the sale of your product which includes payment, processing and arranging for manufacturing your product (s) in respect of the orders placed by the customers via the website and Redbubble will facilitate such payment, and manufacturing in accordance with reasonable business practices unless you otherwise instruct prior to the placement of that order by a customer.</p> 3.\nSale of your products <p>3.1 The retail price charged to customers who purchase your product is made up of the manufacturing fee charged by the third party manufacturer, Redbubble\u2019s fee for hosting the marketplace and facilitating the transaction (the manufacturing fee and Redbubble\u2019s fee are referred to collectively, and inclusive of tax, as the \u201cbase amount\u201d), your creator margin (\u201cyour margin\u201d), and any relevant sales tax (such as Sales Tax, GST, VAT, etc) that Redbubble and / or you (as the case may be) are liable to account for to the appropriate tax authorities.\nShipping charges will also be added to the retail price.\nWhen making each individual work available for sale you are able to select any percentage mark-up you wish, greater than or equal to zero, above the base amount but below the automated upper limit (subject to change from time to time).\nThe percentage mark-up selected by you on the website for each of your products is used to calculate the dollar value of your margin for each sale.</p>\n<p>3.2 You may change the percentage mark-up on top of the base amount at any time by changing your selection on the website.\nWe may change the base amount at any time without specific notice to you and this will affect the dollar value of your margin, which is calculated as a percentage of the base amount (e.g.\nif we increase our base amount, your margin will also increase).\nThe retail price will not change on an individual sale after a customer has submitted an order to the website.</p>\n<p>3.3 Redbubble will send you an email to the email address you registered in your account to notify you when an order has been placed for your products.</p>\n<p>3.4 You agree that Redbubble makes no representation that it will be able to procure an order for your products, whether at the retail price or at all, nor that you will obtain any benefit by entering into this Services Agreement.</p>\n<p>3.5 All items purchased from the website are manufactured pursuant to arrangements with third party suppliers under your instructions.\nThis means that title and risk for loss for such items pass from you to the customer/purchaser without passing through us prior to the goods being delivered to the customer under the customer\u2019s instructions.</p> 4.\nPayment terms <p>4.1 You authorize Redbubble to collect, hold and distribute the retail price (\u201csale proceeds\u201d) from customers on the terms set out in this clause 4.\nRedbubble will also charge the customer for the shipping which will be retained by us and not affect the amount to be distributed to you.</p>\n<p>4.2 You authorize Redbubble to deduct the base amount (which includes Redbubble\u2019s margin for facilitation services, including tax where applicable) from the sales proceeds for your products before distributing your margin (which will include tax where applicable).</p>\n<p>4.3 We will pay your margin in accordance with the payment method you select on the website.\nThis will usually take place between the 15th and 20th days of the month.</p>\n<p>4.4 We may set payment amount threshold amounts in relation to a month or other time period - and where the payment amount does not exceed any applicable threshold for the relevant period, Redbubble may elect to postpone your payment until the threshold is exceeded.</p>\n<p>4.5 It is your responsibility to ensure Redbubble has current details of your postal address and bank account details.\nRedbubble will not be liable for any loss suffered by you if you provide us with incorrect details in relation to the payment method.\nIf we are unable to pay you because you have given us incorrect details or your details are out of date, we will hold your margin for up to 12 months from the payment date.\nIf you have not notified Redbubble of any amendment to the payment method details in that time your margin proceeds will be forfeited to Redbubble or donated to a charity of our choice.</p> 5.\nTaxation responsibility <p>5.1 Except as required otherwise by applicable Federal or State Taxation Laws or Regulations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) Each party is responsible for their own taxes associated with each transaction and will account for any taxes imposed by governments or governing authorities, and related accounting or audit requirements arising out of, as a result of, incidental to, or in connection with obligations under this Services Agreement.\nWe recommend that you consult with your tax advisor as to the application of taxes for you, as the seller of the merchandise.\nThis may include Sales Tax, VAT, GST and other transactional taxes;</li>\n<li>(b) Redbubble will not collect or pay taxes on your behalf as Redbubble is merely acting as an agent in facilitating the sale of your product to the customers.\nAs stated in clause 4.2 of this Agreement, the amounts distributed to you will be deemed to be inclusive of any taxes, if applicable.\nYou will at all times be solely responsible for reporting and remitting any tax liabilities arising out of the sale of your products together with any potential interest or penalties that any tax authority may levy as a result of
