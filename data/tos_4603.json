Fanlore Jump to: navigation, search Contents&nbsp;[hide]&nbsp.\n<ul>\n<li>1 What is the DMCA?</li>\n<li>2 I am a copyright owner and I don\u2019t want my work displayed on Fanlore.</li>\n<li>3 How do I initiate a DMCA takedown request?</li>\n<li>4 Once you have initiated a DMCA takedown notice\u2026</li>\n<li>5 If you are an uploader of contested content\u2026</li>\n<li>6 What can I expect if I file a DMCA counternotice?</li>\n<li>7 What happens to repeat copyright infringers?</li>\n</ul> What is the DMCA?\n<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512) (\u201cDMCA\u201d) creates a safe harbor, or a legal exemption, from copyright infringement liability for Internet service providers (ISPs) and other intermediaries.\nTo encourage and maintain free speech on our sites, the OTW will push back against DMCA takedown requests if we believe that the content in question is actually lawful and fair use.\nThe law requires that DMCA requests be made by the holder of a valid copyright in the work or by an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, and requires that requests are made in good faith under penalty of perjury.\n</p>\nI am a copyright owner and I don\u2019t want my work displayed on Fanlore.\n<p>Fanlore allows the use of copyrighted material without permission of the copyright owner if its use complies with United States fair use laws.\nFanlore is committed to protecting fair use rights, which is important for the benefit of all fan creators.\nHowever, the use of copyrighted material that does not meet the legal criteria of fair use is not permitted on Fanlore.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a copyright owner and you believe that your work is being infringed, in the spirit of open collaboration, we encourage you to seek resolution through the volunteer community.\nYou may contact [wiki (at) transformativeworks.org] with an informal request for content removal.\nPlease provide the exact URL (the \u201caddress\u201d or \u201clocation\u201d of the page as shown by your web browser) of the content and provide enough information to substantiate your claim of copyright ownership.\nWe will do our best to solve the issue to your satisfaction.\n</p>\n<p>Alternatively, or if you are not satisfied with our response, you may initiate a formal DMCA takedown process.\n</p>\nHow do I initiate a DMCA takedown request?\n<p>To initiate a formal DMCA takedown request, please send a letter to us at [legal (at) transformativeworks.org] or to our designated agent:\n</p>\n<p>Organization for Transformative Works<br>\n228 Park Ave S #18156<br>\nNew York, New York 10003-1502<br>\nAttention: Legal\n</p>\n<p>The takedown notice must substantially comply with the provisions of 17.\nU.S.C.\n\u00a7 512\u00a9(3)(A).\nSubmission of a takedown notice further requires that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Court System.\nStatutory requirements of a valid DMCA takedown notice include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> your physical or electronic signature;</li>\n<li> your contact information;</li>\n<li> identification of what work is being infringed;</li>\n<li> identification of the material that you believe to be infringing and a description that allows us to locate the material on our website;</li>\n<li> a statement that you have a good faith belief that the use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand</li>\n<li> a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>\n</ul>\nOnce you have initiated a DMCA takedown notice\u2026\n<p>If the OTW receives a valid and statutorily-compliant DMCA takedown notice, the OTW will remove the content upon satisfactory review of the merits of the infringement claim.\nOnce the content is removed, we will send the report to the Lumen database and other third parties if appropriate.\nWe will also take reasonable steps to notify the content uploader of the DMCA notice.\n</p>\n<p>Please note that a third party may submit a counternotice challenging your takedown request, at which point the OTW is required to restore the previously-removed content.\nThe counternotice operates much like the original notice, but works in the reverse.\nPlease note that there is no statute of limitations for counternotices.\n</p>\n<p>If the OTW receives a valid counternotice, we will seek to notify you of its receipt.\nYou may then initiate legal proceedings against the third party who filed a DMCA counternotice in order to determine copyright ownership and the legality of the material\u2019s use.\nYou will have 10 business days to file suit and enjoin continued use of the content.\nIf you decline to file suit, the OTW will restore the content pursuant to 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512 (g)(2)(B)-\u00a9.\nThe OTW may also post the counternotice online.\nYou may be liable for damages, such as costs and attorney fees, if you knowingly and materially misrepresent your claim.\n</p>\nIf you are an uploader of contested content\u2026\n<p>If you are the uploader of content that has been subject to removal in response to a DMCA takedown notice, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the action.\nIn an effort to be transparent, we will also post the DMCA takedown notice on the Lumen database, and elsewhere, if appropriate.\n</p>\n<p>In the event that material is removed due to a DMCA notice, the only recourse for restoring such material is to file a counternotice with the OTW.\nIf a contribution of yours was the subject of a DMCA takedown and you believe that the contribution did not violate copyright laws, you may wish to file a counternotice.\nPlease feel free to visit the following sites as a first step in learning about filing a counter-notice:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> \u201cResponding to a DMCA Takedown Notice Targeting Your Content\u201d at Citizen Media Law Project</li>\n<li> Lumen Database Clearinghouse FAQ</li>\n<li> Lumen Database Clearinghouse counter-notice generator</li>\n<li> newmediarights.org</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please consider that filing a counternotice may lead to legal proceedings between you and the sender of the takedown notice to determine ownership and legality of the use of the material.\nYou may wish to consult an attorney before filing a counternotice.\n</p>\n<p>Any counternotice that you file must meet statutory provisions under the DMCA and requires that you consent to the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Court System.\nRequirements of a compliant DMCA counternotice under 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512 (g)(3) include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> your physical or electronic signature;</li>\n<li> your name, address, and phone number;</li>\n<li> identification of the material and its location before it was removed;</li>\n<li> a statement under penalty of perjury that the material was removed by mistake or misidentification;</li>\n<li> your consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in the district where you live (if you are in the U.S.), or your consent to the jurisdiction of a federal court in the district where your service provider is located (if you are not in the U.S.).\nand</li>\n<li> your consent to accept service of process from the party who submitted the takedown notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All notices should be sent to the OTW\u2019s designated agent.\n</p>\nWhat can I expect if I file a DMCA counternotice?\n<p>If the OTW receives a statutorily-compliant counternotice, we will make reasonable efforts to notify the original requestor of the takedown that a counternotice was received.\nThe original requestor will have 10 business days from the date the OTW notifies the original requestor of the counternotice to prevent the restoration of the content by filing a lawsuit.\nIf the original requestor has not filed suit, the OTW will restore your content between 10 and 14 business days after receipt of the counternotice.\nThe OTW may also post the counternotice online, with identifying information redacted.\n</p>\nWhat happens to repeat copyright infringers?\n<p>Pursuant to the DMCA, we will terminate, in appropriate circumstances, users and account holders of our system and network who are repeat infringers (see 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512 (i)(1)(A)).\nOnly new content posted to Fanlore after an individual has been notified about the takedown of copyrighted material they uploaded counts as a repeat infringement.\nIndividuals who repeatedly or maliciously post infringing content to Fanlore will have their account permanently suspended.\n</p>\n<p>Adapted from Wikipedia\u2019s DMCA policy.\n</p> Retrieved from

effect to the party's intentions as reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of the ToS remain in full force and effect.\n</p>\n<p>You agree that, regardless of any statute or law to

guardian is required for the processing of personal data of children including e-mail addresses and IP addresses, as well as certain uses of cookies.\nand (b) users who are under the age of thirteen (13) and residents or citizens of any other country.\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> We as an organization have opted to protect teen users\u2019 privacy.\nAs a result, we cannot receive or host Content from individuals that we know are under the age of sixteen and residents/citizens of the European Union, unless they are residents/citizens of the EU countries that allow the collection of Special Categories of Personal Data from those at a younger age and are old enough to consent to the collection of Special Categories of Personal Data in their own country.\nTherefore, any individual who is between the ages of 13 and 16 and a resident or citizen of a country, including a European Economic Area country, that states an age that is older than theirs is required to consent to the processing of personal data without our obtaining written permission from a parent or legal guardian under the GDPR (\u201cAge-Barred Individual\u201d) may not maintain accounts or submit Content.\nBy creating an account or submitting Content, you thereby confirm that if you are between the ages of 13 and 16, you are of an age old enough to consent to the processing of personal data in your country without our obtaining written permission from a parent or legal guardian under the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d).\nA list of countries that apply the GDPR can be found here.\nEach user is responsible for knowing the laws of their own country.\n</li>\n<li> In compliance with United States regulations regarding online privacy for children, the Site does not knowingly solicit or collect information from children under the age of thirteen (13).\nChildren under the age of thirteen (13) are therefore not permitted to have an account or submit Content of any type to the Site.\nBy creating an account or submitting Content to the Site, you thereby confirm that you are thirteen (13) years old or older.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Asking a parent or legal guardian to submit Content does not constitute submitting Content under this policy.\nIf you are under the age of thirteen (13) and not an Age-Barred Individual, your parent or legal guardian may submit content at your request through their account.\n</p>\nData and Content Processing\n<p>Fanlore and the OTW exist to host content about fandoms and canon.\nIn order to host or share Content, we have to process certain data and information including personally identifying information that we collect from users, and that each user inputs.\nIn order to operate the site, host OTW and user Content, and prevent technical issues and breaches, we need to process (e.g.\ncollect, store, retrieve, disseminate, make available, and delete) certain data and information including personally identifying information, also known as \u201cPersonal Data\u201d.\nPersonal Data includes your user name, your e-mail address, your IP information and any personally identifying information you enter on the Site, including information that you put into your User Page (defined below), into the body of a page or other Content itself.\n</p>\n<p>Running the Site requires us to make copies and backup copies of information, including Personal Data, on servers that may be located anywhere around the world.\n</p>\n<p>By using the site, you consent to our collection, processing, retention and display of your Content as set forth and explained in these Terms of Use so we can operate, manage, display and share the creativity on Fanlore.\nif we believe that using, retaining and/or sharing that information is necessary to preserve the integrity of the Site and the Content that we host.\nfor legitimate legal and/or accounting audit purposes.\nwhen we have a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other legal process.\nor when we have a good faith belief that doing so will help prevent imminent harm to someone.\n</p>\nOriginal Content License\nSummary\n<p>Fanlore's original content is licensed

as incorporated in the Collections.\n</p>\n<p>b.\nto create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work.\nFor example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\".\n</p>\n<p>c.\nto Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.\nand,\n</p>\n<p>d.\nto Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n</p>\n<p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised.\nThe above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.\nSubject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(d).\n</p>\n<p>4.\nRestrictions.\nThe license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n</p>\n<p>a.\nYou may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License.\nYou must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\nYou may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.\nYou may not sublicense the Work.\nYou must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\nWhen You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.\nThis Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License.\nIf You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\nIf You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\n</p>\n<p>b.\nYou may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.\nThe exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.\n</p>\n<p>c.\nIf You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties.\n(ii) the title of the Work if supplied.\n(iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work.\nand, (iv) consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\").\nThe credit required by this Section 4 (c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner.\nprovided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n</p>\n<p>d.\nFor the avoidance of doubt:\n</p>\n<p>i.\nNon-waivable Compulsory License Schemes.\nIn those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n</p>\n<p>ii.\nWaivable Compulsory License Schemes.\nIn those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(b) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme.\nand,\n</p>\n<p>iii.\nVoluntary License Schemes.\nThe Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section 4(c).\n</p>\n<p>e.\nExcept as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\nLicensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.\nJapan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>5.\nRepresentations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n</p>\n<p>UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n</p>\n<p>6.\nLimitation on Liability.\nEXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n</p>\n<p>7.\nTermination\n</p>\n<p>a.\nThis License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\nIndividuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\nSections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n</p>\n<p>b.\nSubject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\nNotwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time.\nprovided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n</p>\n<p>8.\nMiscellaneous\n</p>\n<p>a.\nEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n</p>\n<p>b.\nEach time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n</p>\n<p>c.\nIf any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n</p>\n<p>d.\nNo term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n</p>\n<p>e.\nThis License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.\nThere are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here.\nLicensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.\nThis License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n</p>\n<p>f.\nThe rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\nThese rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.\nIf the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License.\nthis License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n</p>\nOther Content\n<p>While all original content posted to Fanlore is under the Creative Commons
