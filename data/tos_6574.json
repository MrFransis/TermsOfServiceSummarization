applicationsHow we use your dataHow Criteo services work across environmentsYour rightsOur partnersCCPA Privacy Policy <ul>\n</ul>\n<p>Welcome! This is where you can learn about Criteo, the technologies and services we offer to our partners, and our data collection and privacy policies.</p> Disable Criteo services <p>&nbsp;</p>\nOur activity\n<p>Criteo helps brands, e-commerce sites and other advertisers (\u201cAdvertisers\u201d) promote their products and services.\nWe do that by enabling Advertisers to tailor their campaigns and/or offers to audiences that they want to reach with content that they wish to promote, which in turns means that you may receive advertising that may be of interest to you on the websites, mobile applications and other platforms of our partners (the \u201cPublishers\u201d).</p>\nHow do our services work?\n<p>Criteo does not use any data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address in plain text, etc.</p>\n<p>When you browse an Advertiser\u2019s website or mobile application that uses our technologies, that technology allows us to collect a limited amount of data relating to your browsing, such as the products you have viewed, put in your shopping cart and purchased.\nFind out more about the type of data collected by Criteo.\nThis navigation data is linked to a unique identifier, namely an identification cookie or any other similar technology (such as mobile advertising identifiers and non-cookie technologies) depending on your navigation environment.</p>\n<p>When you browse a Publisher\u2019s website or mobile application that also uses our technologies, the Publisher notifies us, either directly or through an advertiser exchange, that an advertising space is available to offer you personalized advertising.\nThe Criteo technology, working with our Advertisers, then may decide to purchase that advertising space.</p>\n<p>The advertising you see from our partners when using our technology is based on our recommendation algorithms.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Practical example <p>\n</p>\n<p>Here is one way our technology allows us to provide you with ads that may be of interest to you:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When users visit an Advertiser website using our technologies, data relating to their browsing events are collected.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Example of data collected by Criteo:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>The user with the cookie identifier 123f94d8-a745-4f8b-a1d0-bf6fbbd60058 (let\u2019s name it \u201cCriteo ID 123\u201d for convenience) viewed product A on 01/01/2018 at 13:37 while browsing www.example-advertiser.com.</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Our technologies compare these data with the aggregated data available on the Advertiser\u2019s website.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Example of aggregated data available:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>In general, users who purchased Product A on&nbsp;www.example-advertiser.com&nbsp;also purchased Product B on this website</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>In general, Product C is popular&nbsp;on this website</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>When users browse a Publisher website, we are informed of the availability of advertising spaces.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Example of data collected by Criteo:&nbsp;</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>An advertising space with the following characteristics (size, visibility, etc.) is available on www.example-publisher.com that the Criteo ID 123 is about to browse</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Then our algorithms determine the relevance for buying the advertising space and displaying a personalized ad on it.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Example of decision that would be taken by Criteo: Buy the advertising space available on www.example-publisher.com and display an ad featuring the following products:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Product A, because the user with the Criteo ID 123&nbsp;showed interest in it during a recent session</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Product B, because the user with the Criteo ID 123 is likely to be interested in this product since he/she has viewed product A&nbsp;during a recent session</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Product C, because this product is popular.</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> If you disable Criteo services, we will not display any personalized ads to you.\nOn the other hand, the advertising space may be purchased by another company to display personalized or non-personalized ads.\nIf you want to disable Criteo services,&nbsp;click here.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that the use of our technologies on our partners\u2019 websites and mobile applications is governed by their privacy policies, which can be accessed directly from their websites and/or mobile applications.\nWe require them to provide you with complete and appropriate information and, to the extent required by law, to obtain your consent before any of your personal information is available to us.</p>\n<p>Our technologies are able to work in a similar fashion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>on a webpage by relying on cookies, which are supported by most web browsers;</li>\n<li>on a mobile application by relying on the mobile advertising ID provided by mobile operating system vendors (e.\ng.\nGoogle and Apple);</li>\n<li>on an browser which default settings limit the use of third-party cookies and inter-site tracking, such as Safari, if you provide consent for our services to co-exist with these default settings;</li>\n<li>and in a transversal way between the different environments listed above.\nFind out more about how our services work from one environment to another (\u201ccross-device linking\u201d).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to provide you with ads that are better tailored to your interests, we may receive and process audience and segments information derived from the data you accepted to share with trusted third party partners.\nThese partners may send us information regarding your shopping habits (e.g.\ninterested in clothing, furniture or electronics), the points of interest that are near you based on non-precise geolocation information (e.g.\nstores that are geographically close to you) or the products you have been purchasing in a brick and mortar store of the advertisers that are using our services to manage their online marketing campaigns.\nIn such case, Criteo will only process geolocation information and identifiers (such as cookie IDs and Mobile Advertising IDs) that do not allow us to know who you are.</p>\n<p>We believe that the personalization of ads is beneficial to you and the Internet ecosystem in that it contributes to the promotion of a free and open Internet by allowing Publishers to monetize the content they create, while allowing you to benefit from ads that may be more interesting to you than non-personalized ads that would be displayed to you.</p>\nOur privacy pillars\n<p>We have developed our services and technologies taking great care to respect your privacy.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Data minimisation <p>\n</p>\n<p>We undertake never to use any data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, postal address, email address in plain text, etc.\nWithout ever being able to identify you personally, our technologies are able to recognize your devices and/or browsers on the basis of an identifier consisting of a series of characters (identifier contained in a cookie or other).\nHowever, these data are qualified as personal data by European regulations and personal information by Californian law.\nAs such, they are the subject of our greatest vigilance in terms of security and respect for your privacy.</p>\n<i>\n</i>Privacy by design <p>\n</p>\n<p>Our product teams develop every feature with privacy in mind.\nit\u2019s the cornerstone of Privacy by Design, Criteo\u2019s long-standing

conduct, and is integral to ensuring that we build best-in-class products and services.</li>\n<li>We regularly review and document our internal policies, amend existing privacy policies as necessary, and enforce these policies with our partners and vendors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>Criteo's commitments <p>\n</p>\n<p>Our ads do not require:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To collect data that allows us to identify you directly, such as your first and last name, your postal address, or your email address in plain text.</li>\n<li>To collect sensitive information (such as religion, political opinion, health or sexual orientation \u2026) to create segments or target ads to users.\nFor the sole purpose of serving ads on a publisher\u2019s properties that could possibly reveal sensitive information (eg.\na medical website), we may collect the URL of the website or the name of the mobile application.</li>\n<li>To collect irrevocable identifiers, such as the hardware identifiers of the devices you use (UDID or MAC address, etc.).</li>\n<li>To collect data related to your precise geolocation in real time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<i>\n</i>Criteo supports industry initiatives for greater
