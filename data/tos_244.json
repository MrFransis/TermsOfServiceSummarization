personal data<p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences.\nIn particular, we use data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support.\nIt also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.</li>\n<li>Improve and develop our products.</li>\n<li>Personalize our products and make recommendations.</li>\n<li>Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>\n<p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.</p>\n<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.\nOur automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.\nFor example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do.\nTo build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made.\nFor example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies.\nThis manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>Microsoft uses the data we

these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products).\nFor example Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations.\nHowever, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law.\nFor example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>\n<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both

with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data&nbsp;section of this privacy statement.\nWhen we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the Where we store and process personal data section of this privacy statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>More on the purposes of processing:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Provide our products</strong>.\nWe use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences.\nFor example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service.\nOr, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you.\nAdditionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you.\nFor example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account.\nWe also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product improvement</strong>.\nWe use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities.\nFor example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personalization</strong>.\nMany products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment.\nThese features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location.\nFor example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently.\nIf you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices.\nMany of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product activation</strong>.\nWe use data\u2014such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers\u2014to activate products that require activation.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product development</strong>.\nWe use data to develop new products.\nFor example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers\u2019 computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer support</strong>.\nWe use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers\u2019 devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents.\nCall recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable Microsoft to provide support services and investigate security incidents.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Help secure and troubleshoot</strong>.\nWe use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products.\nThis includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products.\nThis may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Safety</strong>.\nWe use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers.\nOur security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices.\nFor example, some of our products, such as Outlook or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links.\nand we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Updates</strong>.\nWe use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches.\nFor example, we may use information about your device\u2019s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch.\nUpdates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and ensure your device is ready to process such updates.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Promotional communications</strong>.\nWe use data we collect to deliver promotional communications.\nYou can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.\nFor information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the How to access and control your personal data section of this privacy statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relevant offers</strong>.\nMicrosoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products.\nWe analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways.\nFor example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising</strong>.\nMicrosoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you.\nWe use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products, and on third-party web properties, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.\nWe may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you.\nFor more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the Advertising section of this privacy statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prize promotions and events</strong>.\nWe use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Microsoft Stores.\nFor example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win.\nOr, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transacting commerce</strong>.\nWe use data to carry out your transactions with us.\nFor example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Microsoft Store.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reporting and business operations</strong>.\nWe use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence.\nThis enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Protecting rights and property</strong>.\nWe use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property.\nFor example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy.\nWe may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal compliance</strong>.\nWe process data to comply with law.\nFor example, we use the age of our customers to ensure we meet our obligations to protect children\u2019s privacy.\nWe also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Research.</strong> With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard individuals\u2019 rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes.\n</li>\n</ul>Learn moreTop of page<i>\n</i>Reasons we share personal dataReasons we share personal data<p>We share your personal data with your consent or to complete any transaction or

out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using.\nThe opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years.\nIf you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.</p>\n<p>You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account.\nIt will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device.\nIf you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.</p>\n<p>For Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.</p>\n<p>Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other required purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection.\nYou will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Browser-based controls </strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you use a browser, you can control

browser-based cookie controls described in the Cookies section of this privacy statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tracking protections</strong>.\nYou can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) and Microsoft Edge.\nThis feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Browser controls for \"Do Not Track.\"</strong> Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.\nBecause there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.\nWe continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals.\nIn the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.</li>\n</ul>Learn moreTop of page<i>\n</i>Cookies and similar

data from children as related to Xbox.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What is Xbox?</strong> Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft.\nXbox hosts an online network that consists of software and online experiences crossing multiple platforms.\nThis network lets your child find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.\nChildren can connect to the Xbox network using Xbox consoles, Windows 10 PCs, and mobile devices (Android and iPhone).</p>\n<p>Xbox consoles are devices your child can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment.\nWhen they sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on a console, we assign a unique device identifier.\nFor instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console\u2019s operating system they are using.</p>\n<p>Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming.\nTo ensure these connected experiences remain reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected, required service data may be collected whenever your child uses a connected experience.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data we collect when you create an Xbox profile</strong>.\nYou as the parent or guardian are required to consent to the collection of personal data from a child under 13 years old.\nWith your permission, your child can have an Xbox profile and use the online Xbox network.\nDuring the child Xbox profile creation, you will sign in with your own Microsoft account to verify that you are an adult organizer in your Microsoft family group.\nWe collect an alternate email address or phone number to boost account security.\nIf your child needs help accessing their account, they will be able to use one of these alternates to validate they own the Microsoft account.</p>\n<p>We collect limited\u202finformation about children,\u202fincluding\u202fname, birthdate, email address, and region.\u202fWhen you sign\u202fyour child\u202fup for an Xbox profile,\u202fthey get\u202fa gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier.\nWhen you create\u202fyour child\u2019s Xbox profile you consent to Microsoft collecting, using, and sharing\u202finformation based on their privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network.\u202fYour child\u2019s privacy and communication settings are defaulted to the most restrictive.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data we collect</strong>.\n\u202fWe collect information about your child\u2019s use of Xbox services, games, apps, and consoles including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When they sign in and sign out of Xbox, the games they play and apps they use, their game progress, achievements, and play statistics, purchase history, and content they obtain.</li>\n<li>Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected devices, and network connection, including software or hardware errors.</li>\n<li>Content they add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video they capture in games and apps.</li>\n<li>Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections they make (friends they add and people who follow them) on the Xbox network.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your child uses an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time they sign in to Xbox, even if they have been playing offline.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xbox console diagnostic data</strong>.\nIf your child uses an Xbox console, the console will send required data to Microsoft.\nRequired data is the minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Game captures</strong>.\nAny player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play.\nOther players\u2019 game clips and screenshots can capture your child\u2019s in-game character and gamertag during that session.\nIf a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat if your child\u2019s privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network allow it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Captioning</strong>.\nDuring Xbox real-time (\u201cparty\u201d) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text.\nIf a player activates this feature, Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it.\nThis data may also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the\u202fCommunity Standards for Xbox.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data use</strong>.\nMicrosoft uses the data we collect from your child\u2019s use of Xbox consoles, Xbox apps, games, and the Xbox network to provide them with experiences\u2014and make it safer and more fun over time.\nData we collect includes device information and game play statistics, such as the number of unique players and play time per game.\nData we collect also enables us to provide your child with personalized, curated experiences.\nThis includes connecting them to games, content, services, and recommendations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xbox data viewable by others</strong>.\nWhen your child is using the Xbox network, their online presence\u202f(which can be set to \u201cappear offline\u201d or \u201cblocked\u201d), gamertag, game play statistics, and achievements are visible to other players on the network.\nDepending on\u202fhow you set your child\u2019s Xbox safety settings, they\u202fmight share information when playing or communicating with others on the Xbox network.\u202f</p>\n<p>The Xbox network includes communications features such as text and voice, direct messaging, and real-time text and voice chat.\nIn order to help provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the\u202fCommunity Standards for Xbox, we collect and monitor text communications during hosted multiplayer game sessions, direct messages, and other features of the service, including activity feeds and clubs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xbox data shared with game and apps publishers</strong>.\nWhen your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about their usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product.\nThis data may include: your child\u2019s Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your child\u2019s in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game or types of vehicles used in-game), your child\u2019s presence on the Xbox network, the time they spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs they belong to, official club memberships, and any content they create or submit in the game or app.</p>\n<p>Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies.\nYou should carefully review their policies to determine how they use your child\u2019s data.\nFor example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services.\nYou may find their policies linked from the game or app detail pages in our stores.</p>\n<p>Learn more at\u202fData Sharing with Games and Apps.</p>\n<p>To stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where they have been installed.\nSome publisher access to your child\u2019s data may be revoked

data protection laws, including applicable security breach notification laws.</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>Where we store and process personal dataWhere we store and process personal data<p>Personal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate

Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nTypically, the primary storage location is in the customer\u2019s region or in the United States, often with a backup to a data center in another region.\nThe storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem.\nWe take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.</p>\n<p>We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.\nFor example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints.\nWhen we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts such as the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Decision 2004/915/EC, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data.\nTo learn more about the European Commission\u2019s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on the European Commission website.</p>\n<p>Microsoft Corporation complies with

transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although Microsoft does not rely on the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.\nMicrosoft Corporation has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIf third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\nThe controlled U.S.\nsubsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield

retention of personal dataOur retention of personal data<p>Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.\nBecause these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.</p>\n<p>Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?</strong> Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox.\nIn such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion).\n(Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?</strong> If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</strong> If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?</strong> For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</strong> If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?</strong> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation.\nConversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.</li>\n</ul>Top of page<i>\n</i>California Consumer Privacy ActCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act<p>If you are

Privacy</strong>.\nThese privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences.\nFor example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content.\nTurning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage.\nBut even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below.\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.</p>\n<p> There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 functions and cannot be disabled.\nFor example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential.\nRequired service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured.\nSee Essential Services for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Required service data for connected experiences</strong>.\nAs you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience.\nThis data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences.\nWe refer to this data as required service data.\n</p>\n<p>Required service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\nIf you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience.\nYour text and the translation are not stored by our service.\nRequired service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Office app.</p>\n<p> See Required service data for Office for more information.\n</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>Microsoft TeamsMicrosoft

application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Microsoft 365 or Office 365.</p>\n<p>When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services.\nExamples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken.\nWe also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.</p>\n<p>When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it.\nFor example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder.\nIf you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.</p>\n<p>When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network.\nDoing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network.\nTo delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.</p>\n<p>When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends.\nThe link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content.\nIf one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them.\nTo revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels.\nRevoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link.\nNo one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.</p>\n<p>Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive.\nOneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service.</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>OutlookOutlook<p>Outlook products are designed to improve your productivity through

applications.</p>\n<p>To add an account, you must provide permission for Outlook to access data from the email or file storage services.</p>\n<p>When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device.\nIf you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application.\nIf you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers.\nAt any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.</p>\n<p>If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of Outlook.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the data the

apps.\nBing services collect and process data in many forms, including text that has been inked or typed, voice data, and images.\nBing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Cortana, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).\n</p>\n<p> When you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration.\nFor example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft.\nTo learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.\nAnd, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft.\nWhen you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Search suggestions</strong>.\nFor the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience (such as search and site suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to conduct a search and what you click on will be sent to Microsoft.\nThis allows us to provide you with relevant suggestions as you type your searches.\nTo turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to Bing Settings.\nThere are other methods to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge browser.\nSearch Suggestions cannot be turned off in the Windows 10 search box.\nOn Windows, you can always hide the search box so as not to use the feature.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Bing experience improvement program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar</strong>.\nIf you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance.\nTo help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you.\nYou can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings.\nFinally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Retention and de-identification</strong>.\nWe de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personalization through Microsoft account</strong>.\nSome Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices.\nYou can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services.\nVisit Bing Settings to manage your personalization settings, or the Microsoft privacy dashboard to manage your data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing search history</strong>.\nWhen you\u2019re signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search history on the Microsoft privacy dashboard.\nThe Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser.\nYou may clear your search history on a device through this service.\nClearing your history prevents that history from being displayed on the Search History site, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard.\nIf you are signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account using Microsoft Search in Bing, you can export your Microsoft Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it.\nYour Microsoft Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-party services that use Bing</strong>.\nYou may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!.\nIn order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier).\nThis data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service.\nMicrosoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners.\nYou should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data passed to destination website</strong>.\nWhen you select a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit\u2014such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the host name of the site you came from (in this case, https://www.bing.com/).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties</strong>.\nWe share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties.\nBefore we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers).\nAdditionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.\n</p>Top of

data as Full diagnostic data.</p>\n<p>If an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device, we and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management, monitoring, and troubleshooting of the organization's devices, and for other purposes of the organization.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Required diagnostic data</strong> includes information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly.\nWe collect the following Required diagnostic data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Device, connectivity, and configuration data: <ul>\n<li>Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.</li>\n<li>Network capabilities and connection data such as the device\u2019s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.</li>\n<li>Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics data settings, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.</li>\n<li>Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.</li>\n<li>Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.</li>\n<li>Whether updates complete successfully or fail.</li>\n<li>Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.</li>\n<li>Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device.\nFor example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Optional diagnostic data</strong> includes more detailed information about your device and its settings, capabilities, and device health.\nOptional diagnostic data also includes data about the websites you browse, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users.\nWhen you choose to send Optional diagnostic data, Required diagnostic data will always be included, and we collect the following additional information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected under Required diagnostic data.</li>\n<li>Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under Required diagnostic data.\n</li>\n<li>App activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to

features such as handwriting recognition, autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many languages used by Windows customers.\nWhen Microsoft collects inking and typing diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original content or associate the input to you.\nIt also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary.\nLearn more about improving inking and typing in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>If you choose to turn on <strong>Tailored experiences</strong>, we will use your Windows diagnostic data (Basic or Full as you have selected) to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft experiences.\nIf you have selected Basic as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly.\nIf you have selected Full, personalization is also based on information about how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device.\nHowever, we do not use information about the websites you browse, the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data from customers who have selected Full.</p>\n<p>Tailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize Windows, as well as ads and recommendations for Microsoft and third-party products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your Windows experiences.\nFor example, to help you get the most out of your device, we

sensing, and recordingLocation services, motion sensing, and recording<p>\n<strong>Windows location service</strong>.\nMicrosoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device.\nDepending on the capabilities of the device, the device\u2019s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely.\nWhen you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected.\nThis de-identified copy of location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see https://www.here.com/), to improve the location services of the provider.</p>\n<p>Windows services and features (such as browsers and Cortana), apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device\u2019s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so.\nSome features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device\u2019s location.\nFor information about certain Windows apps that use the device\u2019s location, see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement.</p>\n<p>When an app or feature accesses the device\u2019s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you\u2019ve granted permission.\nWe will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one).\nData about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history.\nYou can clear your device's location history at any time in the device's Settings menu.\n</p>\n<p>In Settings, you can also view which apps have access to the device\u2019s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device\u2019s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device\u2019s location.\nYou can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can\u2019t detect a more exact location for your device.</p>\n<p>Even when you\u2019ve turned off access to the device\u2019s location, some third-party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the device\u2019s precise location.\nLearn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device\u2019s location when the device\u2019s location setting is off.</p>\n<p>In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings.\nIf your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device\u2019s location.\nLearn more about location in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General Location</strong>.\nIf you turn on the General Location feature, apps that cannot use your precise location will have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Find My Phone</strong>.\nThe Find My Phone feature allows you to find the location of your Windows phone from the Microsoft account website, even if you have turned off all access to the location service on the phone.\nIf you have turned on the \"save my location every few hours\" feature in the Find My Phone settings on your phone, the Find My Phone feature will periodically send and store a single last-known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location services on your phone.\nEach time a new location is sent, it replaces the previously-stored location.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Find my device</strong>.\nThe Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows portable device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices.\nTo enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled.\nThis feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps.\nWhen the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area.\nLearn more about Find my device in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Windows motion

services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device.\nWhen checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the download location, and the file's digital certificates.\nIf Microsoft Defender SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file.\nWhen checking web content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content.\nIf Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in Settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Defender Antivirus</strong>.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device.\nIf Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device.\nWhen Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files for further inspection.\nIf a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent.\nYou can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>Speech, Voice Activation, Inking, and TypingSpeech, Voice Activation, Inking, and Typing<p>\n<strong>Speech</strong>.\nMicrosoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technologies.\n</p>\n<p> Turning on the online speech recognition setting lets you use Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition technologies in Cortana, the Mixed Reality Portal, dictation in Windows, supported Microsoft Store apps, and over time in other parts of Windows.\n</p>\n<p> Turning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions.\nBoth device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled.\nWith both settings enabled, while your headset

personal dataHow we use personal datamainhowweusepersonaldatamoduleSummary<p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences.\nIn particular, we use data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support.\nIt also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.</li>\n<li>Improve and develop our products.</li>\n<li>Personalize our products and make recommendations.</li>\n<li>Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>\n<p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.</p>\n<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.\nOur automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.\nFor example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do.\nTo build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made.\nFor example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies.\nThis manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft\u2019s behalf.</p>Full text<p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you rich, interactive experiences.\nIn particular, we use data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide our products, which

example Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations.\nHowever, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law.\nFor example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>\n<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.\nOur automated methods often are related to and supported by our

legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data&nbsp;section of this privacy statement.\nWhen we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the Where we store and process personal data section of this privacy statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>More on the purposes of processing:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Provide our products</strong>.\nWe use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences.\nFor example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service.\nOr, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you.\nAdditionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you.\nFor example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account.\nWe also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product improvement</strong>.\nWe use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities.\nFor example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personalization</strong>.\nMany products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment.\nThese features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location.\nFor example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently.\nIf you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices.\nMany of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product activation</strong>.\nWe use data\u2014such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers\u2014to activate products that require activation.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product development</strong>.\nWe use data to develop new products.\nFor example, we use data, often de-identified,

and investigate security incidents.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Help secure and troubleshoot</strong>.\nWe use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products.\nThis includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products.\nThis may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Safety</strong>.\nWe use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers.\nOur security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices.\nFor example, some of our products, such as Outlook or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links.\nand we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Updates</strong>.\nWe use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches.\nFor example, we may use information about your device\u2019s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch.\nUpdates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and ensure your device is ready to process such updates.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Promotional communications</strong>.\nWe use data we collect to deliver promotional communications.\nYou can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.\nFor information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the How to access and control your personal data section of this privacy statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relevant offers</strong>.\nMicrosoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products.\nWe analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways.\nFor example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising</strong>.\nMicrosoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you.\nWe use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products, and on third-party web properties, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.\nWe may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you.\nFor more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the Advertising section of this privacy statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prize promotions and events</strong>.\nWe use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Microsoft Stores.\nFor example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win.\nOr, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transacting commerce</strong>.\nWe use data to carry out your transactions with us.\nFor example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Microsoft Store.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reporting and business operations</strong>.\nWe use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence.\nThis enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Protecting rights and property</strong>.\nWe use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property.\nFor example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy.\nWe may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal compliance</strong>.\nWe process data to comply with law.\nFor example, we use the age of our customers to ensure we meet our obligations to protect children\u2019s privacy.\nWe also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Research.</strong> With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard individuals\u2019 rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes.\n</li>\n</ul>Reasons we share

your personal data that Microsoft has obtained, and exercise your data protection rights, using various tools we provide.\nThe tools most useful to you will depend on our interactions with you and your use of our products.\nHere is a general list of tools we provide to help you control your personal data.\nspecific products may provide additional controls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Microsoft privacy dashboard</strong>.\nYou can control some of the data Microsoft processes through your use of a Microsoft account on the Microsoft privacy dashboard.\nFrom here, for example, you can view and clear the browsing, search, and location data associated with your Microsoft account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cortana</strong>.\nYou can control some of the data Cortana accesses or stores in your Cortana settings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Microsoft account</strong>.\nIf you wish to access, edit, or remove the profile information and payment information in your Microsoft account, change your password, add

data processed by Microsoft that is not available via the tools above or directly through the Microsoft products you use, you can always contact Microsoft at the address in the How to contact us section or by using our web form.\nWe will respond to requests to control your personal data as required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your communications preferences</strong>\n</p>\n<p> You can choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.\nIf you receive promotional email or SMS messages from us and would like to opt out, you can do so by following the directions in that message.\nYou can also make choices about the receipt of promotional email, telephone calls, and postal mail by signing in with your personal Microsoft account, and viewing your communication permissions where you can update contact information, manage Microsoft-wide contact preferences, opt out of email subscriptions, and choose whether to share your contact information with Microsoft partners.\nIf you do not have a personal Microsoft account, you can manage your Microsoft email contact preferences by using this web form.\nThese choices do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Microsoft products, programs, activities, or to surveys or other informational communications that have their own unsubscribe method.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your advertising choices</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft, visit our opt-out page.\nWhen you opt out, your preference is stored in a cookie that is specific to the web browser you are using.\nThe opt-out cookie has an expiration date of five years.\nIf you delete the cookies on your device, you need to opt out again.</p>\n<p>You can also link your opt-out choice with your personal Microsoft account.\nIt will then apply on any device where you use that account and will continue to apply until someone signs in with a different personal Microsoft account on that device.\nIf you delete the cookies on your device, you will need to sign in again for the settings to apply.</p>\n<p>For Microsoft-controlled advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.</p>\n<p>Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other required purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection.\nYou will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from third parties we partner with by visiting their sites (see above).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Browser-based controls </strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you use a browser, you can control your personal data using certain features.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Cookie controls</strong>.\nYou can control the data stored by cookies and withdraw consent to cookies by using the browser-based cookie controls described in the Cookies section of this privacy statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tracking protections</strong>.\nYou can control the data third-party sites can collect about you using Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) and Microsoft Edge.\nThis feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Browser controls for \"Do Not Track.\"</strong> Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.\nBecause there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.\nWe continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals.\nIn the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.</li>\n</ul>Cookies and similar technologiesCookies and similar

consent or authorization from a parent or guardian before they can use it.\nWe will not knowingly ask children under that age to provide more data than is required to provide for the product.</p>\n<p>Once parental consent or authorization is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account.\nThe child can access communication services, like Outlook and Skype, and can freely communicate and share data with other users of all ages.\nLearn more about parental consent and Microsoft child accounts.</p>\n<p>Parents or guardians can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit, or request the deletion of the personal data of the children for whom they provided consent or authorization.\nAs the organizer of a Microsoft family group, the parent or guardian can manage a child\u2019s information and settings on their Family Safety page and view and delete a child\u2019s data on their privacy dashboard.</p>\n<p>Below is additional information about the collection of data from children as related to Xbox.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What is Xbox?</strong> Xbox is the gaming and entertainment division of Microsoft.\nXbox hosts an online network that consists of software and online experiences crossing multiple platforms.\nThis network lets your child find and play games, view content, and connect with friends on Xbox and other gaming and social networks.\nChildren can connect to the Xbox network using Xbox consoles, Windows 10 PCs, and mobile devices (Android and iPhone).</p>\n<p>Xbox consoles are devices your child can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment.\nWhen they sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on a console, we assign a unique device identifier.\nFor instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console\u2019s operating system they are using.</p>\n<p>Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming.\nTo ensure these connected experiences remain reliable, up to date, secure, and performing as expected, required service data may be collected whenever your child uses a connected experience.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data we collect when you create an Xbox profile</strong>.\nYou as the parent or guardian are required to consent to the collection of personal data from a child under 13 years old.\nWith your permission, your child can have an Xbox profile and use the online Xbox network.\nDuring the child Xbox profile creation, you will sign in with your own Microsoft account to verify that you are an adult organizer in your Microsoft family group.\nWe collect an alternate email address or phone number to boost account security.\nIf your child needs help accessing their account, they will be able to use one of these alternates to validate they own the Microsoft account.</p>\n<p>We collect limited\u202finformation about children,\u202fincluding\u202fname, birthdate, email address, and region.\u202fWhen you sign\u202fyour child\u202fup for an Xbox profile,\u202fthey get\u202fa gamertag (a public nickname) and a unique identifier.\nWhen you create\u202fyour child\u2019s Xbox profile you consent to Microsoft collecting, using, and sharing\u202finformation based on their privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network.\u202fYour child\u2019s privacy and communication settings are defaulted to the most restrictive.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data we collect</strong>.\n\u202fWe collect information about your child\u2019s use of Xbox services, games, apps, and consoles including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When they sign in and sign out of Xbox, the games they play and apps they use, their game progress, achievements, and play statistics, purchase history, and content they obtain.</li>\n<li>Performance data about Xbox consoles, Xbox Game Pass and other Xbox apps, the Xbox network, connected devices, and network connection, including software or hardware errors.</li>\n<li>Content they add, upload, or share through the Xbox network, including text, pictures, and video they capture in games and apps.</li>\n<li>Social activity, including chat data and interactions with other gamers, and connections they make (friends they add and people who follow them) on the Xbox network.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your child uses an Xbox console or Xbox app on another device capable of accessing the Xbox network, and that device includes a storage device (hard drive or memory unit), usage data will be stored on the storage device and sent to Microsoft the next time they sign in to Xbox, even if they have been playing offline.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xbox console diagnostic data</strong>.\nIf your child uses an Xbox console, the console will send required data to Microsoft.\nRequired data is the minimum data necessary to help keep Xbox safe, secure, up to date, and performing as expected.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Game captures</strong>.\nAny player in a multiplayer game session can record video (game clips) and capture screenshots of their view of the game play.\nOther players\u2019 game clips and screenshots can capture your child\u2019s in-game character and gamertag during that session.\nIf a player captures game clips and screenshots on a PC, the resulting game clips might also capture audio chat if your child\u2019s privacy and communication settings on the Xbox online network allow it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Captioning</strong>.\nDuring Xbox real-time (\u201cparty\u201d) chat, players may activate a voice-to-text feature that lets them view that chat as text.\nIf a player activates this feature, Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it.\nThis data may also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the\u202fCommunity Standards for Xbox.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data use</strong>.\nMicrosoft uses the data we collect from your child\u2019s use of Xbox consoles, Xbox apps, games, and the Xbox network to provide them with experiences\u2014and make it safer and more fun over time.\nData we collect includes device information and game play statistics, such as the number of unique players and play time per game.\nData we collect also enables us to provide your child with personalized, curated experiences.\nThis includes connecting them to games, content, services, and recommendations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xbox data viewable by others</strong>.\nWhen your child is using the Xbox network, their online presence\u202f(which can be set to \u201cappear offline\u201d or \u201cblocked\u201d), gamertag, game play statistics, and achievements are visible to other players on the network.\nDepending on\u202fhow you set your child\u2019s Xbox safety settings, they\u202fmight share information when playing or communicating with others on the Xbox network.\u202f</p>\n<p>The Xbox network includes communications features such as text and voice, direct messaging, and real-time text and voice chat.\nIn order to help provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the\u202fCommunity Standards for Xbox, we collect and monitor text communications during hosted multiplayer game sessions, direct messages, and other features of the service, including activity feeds and clubs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xbox data shared with game and apps publishers</strong>.\nWhen your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about their usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product.\nThis data may include: your child\u2019s Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your child\u2019s in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game or types of vehicles used in-game), your child\u2019s presence on the Xbox network, the time they spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs they belong to, official club memberships, and any content they create or submit in the game or app.</p>\n<p>Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies.\nYou should carefully review their policies to determine how they use your child\u2019s data.\nFor example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services.\nYou may find their policies linked from the game or app detail pages in our stores.</p>\n<p>Learn more at\u202fData Sharing with Games and Apps.</p>\n<p>To stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where they have been installed.\nSome publisher access to your child\u2019s data may be revoked at\u202fmicrosoft.com/consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing child settings</strong>.\nAs the organizer of a Microsoft family group, you can manage a child\u2019s information and settings on their\u202fFamily Safety page, as well as their Xbox profile privacy settings from their Xbox Privacy &amp.\nonline safety page.</p>\n<p>You can also use the Xbox Family Settings app to manage your child\u2019s experience on the Xbox Network including: spending for Microsoft and Xbox stores, viewing your child\u2019s Xbox

Privacy.</p>Security of personal dataSecurity of personal datamainsecurityofpersonaldatamoduleSummary<p>Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal data.\nWe use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.\nFor example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities.\nWhen we transmit highly confidential data (such as a credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.\nMicrosoft complies with applicable data protection laws, including applicable security breach notification laws.</p>Where we store and process personal dataWhere we store and process personal datamainwherewestoreandprocessdatamoduleSummary<p>Personal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities.\nMicrosoft maintains major data centers in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nTypically, the primary storage location is in the customer\u2019s region or in the United States, often with a backup to a data center in another region.\nThe storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem.\nWe take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.</p>\n<p>We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.\nFor example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints.\nWhen we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts such as the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Decision 2004/915/EC, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data.\nTo learn more about the European Commission\u2019s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on the European Commission website.</p>\n<p>Microsoft Corporation complies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although Microsoft does not rely on the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.\nMicrosoft Corporation has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIf third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\nThe controlled U.S.\nsubsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles\u2014for more info, see the list of Microsoft U.S.\nentities or subsidiaries adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>\n<p>If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy

Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield, we encourage you to contact us via our web form.\nFor any complaints related to the Privacy Shield frameworks that Microsoft cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.\nPlease contact us if you\u2019d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts.\nAs further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration is available to address residual complaints not resolved by other means.\nMicrosoft is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>Our retention of personal dataOur retention of personal datamainOurretentionofpersonaldatamoduleSummary<p>Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.\nBecause these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.</p>\n<p>Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?</strong> Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox.\nIn such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion).\n(Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?</strong> If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</strong> If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?</strong> For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</strong> If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?</strong> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation.\nConversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.</li>\n</ul>California Consumer Privacy ActCalifornia Consumer Privacy ActmaincaliforniaconsumerprivacyactmoduleSummary<p>If you are a California resident, we process your personal data in

collection of productivity services and Office applications including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, among others.\nFor more details about Outlook, see the Outlook section of this privacy statement.\nMicrosoft 365 is a service that is comprised of client software applications and connected online services that span many platforms and have numerous interdependent experiences.\nVarious Microsoft 365 services enable you to use your file content for designs and recommendations, collaborate with others within your documents, and provide you functionality from other Microsoft products, such as Bing and Cortana, and third-party connected products.\nIf you work in an organization, your administrator may turn off or disable these connected services.\nYou can access the privacy controls within your Office apps by selecting <strong>File</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account Privacy</strong>.\nSee Account Privacy Settings for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Office Roaming Service</strong>.\nThe Office Roaming Service helps keep your Microsoft 365 settings up to date across your devices running Microsoft 365.\nWhen you sign in to Microsoft 365 with your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the Office Client Policy Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings to Microsoft servers (such as a list of most recently used documents and the last location viewed within a document).\nWhen you sign in to Microsoft 365 on another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device.\nThe Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings when you sign in to Office.com.\nWhen you sign out of Microsoft 365, the Office Roaming Service removes your Microsoft 365 settings from your device.\nAny changes you make to your customized Microsoft 365 settings are sent to Microsoft servers.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Updates</strong>.\nMicrosoft uses services such as Click-to-Run or Microsoft AutoUpdate to provide you with security and other important updates.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Click-to-Run Update Service</strong>.\nThe Click-to-Run Update Service allows you to install certain Microsoft 365 products over the internet.\nThe Click-to-Run Update Service also automatically detects online updates to Click-to-Run-enabled products on your device and downloads and installs them

translation request that gets sent to Microsoft Translator API service will be logged, your submitted text will not be used to improve the quality of the Microsoft Translator service, and there will not be any record of any portion of your data retained by Microsoft.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Diagnostic Data</strong>.\nDiagnostic data is used to (i) keep your Office apps secure and up to date.\n(ii) detect, diagnose, and remediate problems.\nand (iii) make product improvements.\nThis data does not include a user's name or email address, the content of the user's files, or information about apps unrelated to Office.\nUsers have a choice between two different levels of diagnostic data collection, Required and Optional.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Required</strong>.\nThe minimum data necessary to help keep Office apps secure, up to date, and performing as expected on the device it's installed on.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Optional</strong>.\nAdditional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> See Diagnostic Data in Office for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Connected Experiences</strong>.\nMicrosoft 365 continues to provide more experiences in client applications that are connected to and backed by cloud-based services.\nIf you choose to use connected experiences, required service data will be collected to ensure that all these connected experiences will be reliable, up to date, remain secure, and perform as expected.\nSee below for additional information about required service data.\n</p>\n<p>Microsoft 365 consists of client software applications and connected experiences designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively.\nWorking with others on a document stored on OneDrive for Business or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences.\nThere are two types of connected experiences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Experiences that analyze your content</strong>.\nExperiences that use your Office content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features.\nFor example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Experiences that download online content</strong>.\nExperiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents.\nFor example, templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> You can access the privacy controls within your Office apps by selecting <strong>File</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account Privacy</strong>.\nThese privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences.\nFor example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content.\nTurning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage.\nBut even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below.\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.</p>\n<p> There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 functions and cannot be disabled.\nFor example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential.\nRequired service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured.\nSee Essential Services for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Required service data for connected experiences</strong>.\nAs you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience.\nThis data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences.\nWe refer to this data as required service data.\n</p>\n<p>Required service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\nIf you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience.\nYour text and the translation are not stored by our service.\nRequired service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Office app.</p>\n<p> See Required service data for Office for more information.\n</p>Microsoft TeamsMicrosoft

features, Microsoft collects data about the usage of the features as well as information about your communications, including the time and date of the communication and users that are part of the communication.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Teams profile</strong>.\nYour Teams profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account.\nTo enable other people to find you on Teams (or products that interact with Teams for personal use, including Teams for enterprise) your display name and picture are visible to other users on Teams that have your contact information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Teams contacts</strong>.\nWith your permission, Teams will sync your device contacts periodically and check for other Teams users that match contacts in your device\u2019s address book.\nYou are always in control of your contacts and can stop syncing at any time.\nIf you choose to stop syncing your device contacts, any device contacts that have not been matched during the synchronization process will be deleted from Teams.\nIf you wish to invite any of your device contacts to join a conversation, you can invite users to a 1:1 directly, or Microsoft can send an invitation on your behalf via SMS or email for invitations to group conversations.\nYou can block users if you don\u2019t want to receive their communications.\nadditionally you can report a concern to Microsoft.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Location sharing</strong>.\nYou can share your static or live location with individuals or groups within Teams.\nYou are in control and can stop sharing at any time.\nSharing location for children is permitted with parental consent and in groups where an adult from the Microsoft family group is present.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Push notifications</strong>.\nTo let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Teams uses the notification service on your device.\nFor many devices, these services are provided by another company.\nTo tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Teams has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you.\nThe company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy.\nMicrosoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to use the notification services for incoming Teams calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found on your device.</p>OneDriveOneDrivemainonedrivemoduleSummary<p>OneDrive lets you store and access your files on virtually any device.\nYou can also share and collaborate on your files with others.\nSome versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Microsoft 365 or Office 365.</p>\n<p>When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services.\nExamples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken.\nWe also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.</p>\n<p>When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it.\nFor example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder.\nIf you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.</p>\n<p>When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network.\nDoing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network.\nTo delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.</p>\n<p>When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends.\nThe link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content.\nIf one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them.\nTo revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels.\nRevoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link.\nNo one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.</p>\n<p>Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive.\nOneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service.</p>OutlookOutlookmainoutlookmoduleSummary<p>Outlook products are

third-party providers, with Outlook applications.</p>\n<p>To add an account, you must provide permission for Outlook to access data from the email or file storage services.</p>\n<p>When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device.\nIf you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application.\nIf you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers.\nAt any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.</p>\n<p>If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of Outlook.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the data the Outlook applications collect and process, please see the Microsoft 365 section of this privacy statement.</p>SkypeSkypemainskypemoduleSummary<p> Skype

before recording any communication.\nThis may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.</strong> Microsoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Skype bots</strong>.\nBots are programs offered by Microsoft or third parties that can do many useful things like search for news, play games, and more.\nDepending on their capabilities, bots may have access to your display name, Skype ID, country, region, language, and any messages, audio, video, or content that you share with the bot.\nPlease review the bot profile and its privacy statement before engaging in a one-to-one or group conversation with a bot.\nYou can delete a bot that you no longer wish to

forms, including text that has been inked or typed, voice data, and images.\nBing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Cortana, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).\n</p>\n<p> When you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration.\nFor example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft.\nTo learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.\nAnd, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft.\nWhen you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Search suggestions</strong>.\nFor the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience (such as search and site suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to conduct a search and what you click on will be sent to Microsoft.\nThis allows us to provide you with relevant suggestions as you type your searches.\nTo turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to Bing Settings.\nThere are other methods to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge browser.\nSearch Suggestions cannot be turned off in the Windows 10 search box.\nOn Windows, you can always hide the search box so as not to use the feature.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Bing experience improvement program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar</strong>.\nIf you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance.\nTo help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you.\nYou can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings.\nFinally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Retention and de-identification</strong>.\nWe de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personalization through Microsoft account</strong>.\nSome Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices.\nYou can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services.\nVisit Bing Settings to manage your personalization settings, or the Microsoft privacy dashboard to manage your data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing search history</strong>.\nWhen you\u2019re signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search history on the Microsoft privacy dashboard.\nThe Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser.\nYou may clear your search history on a device through this service.\nClearing your history prevents that history from being displayed on the Search History site, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard.\nIf you are signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account using Microsoft Search in Bing, you can export your Microsoft Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it.\nYour Microsoft Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-party services that use Bing</strong>.\nYou may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!.\nIn order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier).\nThis data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service.\nMicrosoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners.\nYou should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data passed to destination website</strong>.\nWhen you select a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit\u2014such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the host name of the site you came from (in this case, https://www.bing.com/).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties</strong>.\nWe share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties.\nBefore we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers).\nAdditionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.\n</p>CortanaCortanamaincortanamoduleSummary<p>This section applies to the legacy version of Cortana released as part of Windows 10

you use and how you type and use this data to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrection and predictive text that adapts to you.\nWe also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji predictions.\n</p>\n<p> SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model.\nThis model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style.\nThe model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey\u2019s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered.\nThe model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites.\nThe SwiftKey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing password or payment data.\nSwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us (as described further below).\nWhen you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data.\nWe use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products.\n</p>\n<p> The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account.\nIf you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup.\nWhen you create a SwiftKey Account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data.\nAll data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels.\n</p>\n<p> You may also opt in to share your language, typing data, and/or voice clips for the purposes of improving Microsoft products and services.\nDepending on the opt-ins you choose, SwiftKey may send short snippets of data about what and how you type and/or your voice clips, and related correction data to our servers for processing.\nThese text snippets and/or voice clips are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements.\nTo preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these text snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these text snippets and/or voice clips will not be linked to it.\nTo learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.\n</p>\n<p> If you sign into your SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data or voice clips, Microsoft will process your shared data in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our user base.\nThis allows us to improve our basic models for individual languages.\nLanguage and typing data used in this process is aggregated and any words or combinations of words that might be personal to individuals or small groups of users are filtered out.\n</p>\n<p> You can withdraw your consent to share your language and typing data or voice clips for product improvement at any time in SwiftKey Settings.\nYou can also withdraw your consent for SwiftKey Services to retain your personal data in SwiftKey Settings.\nWhen you withdraw consent for SwiftKey to retain your personal data, all personal data collected through your use of

these notifications at any time in the SwiftKey Settings.\n</p>WindowsWindowsmainwindowsmoduleSummary<p>Windows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub.\nRather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features.\nIn order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows.\nAnd because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it.\nNote that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device.\nAdditionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files.\nFor more information about data collection and privacy in Windows, see Windows 10 and your online services.\nEarlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements.</p>ActivationActivationmainactivationmoduleSummary<p>When you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed.\nThe product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to help validate your license to the software.\nThis data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license.\nOn phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power-up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.</p>Activity historyActivity historymainactivityhistorymoduleSummary<p>Activity history helps keep track of the things you do on your device, such as the apps and services you use, the files you open, and the websites you browse.\nYour activity history is stored locally on your device when using different apps and features such as Microsoft Edge, some Microsoft Store apps, and Microsoft 365 apps.\nIf you've signed in to your device with a Microsoft account and given your permission, Windows sends your activity history to Microsoft.\nOnce your activity history is in the cloud, Microsoft uses that data to enable cross-device experiences, to provide you with the ability to continue those activities on other devices, to provide personalized experiences (such as ordering your activities based on duration of use) and relevant suggestions (such as anticipating what your needs might be based on your activity history), and to help improve Microsoft products.</p>\n<p>Activity history is also created and sent to Microsoft when you use Microsoft apps, such as Microsoft Edge, and Office apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, on mobile devices such as iOS and Android phones and tablets.\nIf you are signed in with your Microsoft account, you can continue activities on your Windows&nbsp;10 device that you started in Microsoft apps on your Android or iOS device.\nYou can turn settings off or on for sending your activity history to Microsoft and storing activity history locally on your device, and you can also clear your device\u2019s activity history at any time by going to Start &gt.\nSettings &gt.\nPrivacy &gt.\nActivity history.\nLearn more about activity history in Windows 10.</p>Advertising IDAdvertising IDmainadvertisingidmoduleSummary<p>Windows generates a unique advertising ID for each person using a device, which app developers and advertising networks can then use for their own purposes, including providing relevant advertising in apps.\nWhen the advertising ID is enabled, both Microsoft apps and third-party apps can access and use the advertising ID in much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie.\nThus, your advertising ID can be used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising and other personalized experiences across their apps and on the web.\nMicrosoft collects the advertising ID for the uses described here only when you choose to enable the advertising ID as part of your privacy setting.</p>\n<p>The advertising ID setting applies to Windows apps using the Windows advertising identifier.\nYou can turn off access to this identifier at any time by turning off the advertising ID in Settings.\nIf you choose to turn it on again, the advertising ID will be reset and a new identifier will be generated.\nWhen a third-party app accesses the advertising ID, its use of the advertising ID will be subject to its own privacy policy.\nLearn more about advertising ID in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>The advertising ID setting does not apply to other methods of interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft or third parties, such as cookies used to provide interest-based display ads on websites.\nThird-party products accessed through or installed on Windows may also deliver other forms of interest-based advertising subject to their own privacy policies.\nMicrosoft delivers other forms of interest-based ads in certain Microsoft

helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services and, for customers who have turned on the \u201cTailored experiences\u201d setting, to provide more relevant tips and recommendations to tailor Microsoft and third-party products and services for Windows to the customer\u2019s needs.\nThis data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns.</p>\n<p>There are two levels of diagnostic and activity data: Required diagnostic data and Optional diagnostic data.\nCertain product documentation and other materials refer to Required diagnostic data as Basic diagnostic data and to Optional diagnostic data as Full diagnostic data.</p>\n<p>If an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device, we and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management, monitoring, and troubleshooting of the organization's devices, and for other purposes of the organization.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Required diagnostic data</strong> includes information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly.\nWe collect the following Required diagnostic data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Device, connectivity, and configuration data: <ul>\n<li>Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.</li>\n<li>Network capabilities and connection data such as the device\u2019s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.</li>\n<li>Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics data settings, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.</li>\n<li>Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.</li>\n<li>Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.</li>\n<li>Whether updates complete successfully or fail.</li>\n<li>Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.</li>\n<li>Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device.\nFor example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Optional diagnostic data</strong> includes more detailed information about your device and its settings, capabilities, and device health.\nOptional diagnostic data also includes data about the websites you browse, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users.\nWhen you choose to send Optional diagnostic data, Required diagnostic data will always be included, and we collect the following additional information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected under Required diagnostic data.</li>\n<li>Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under Required diagnostic data.\n</li>\n<li>App activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input.\n</li>\n<li>Browser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer).\n</li>\n<li>Enhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred).\nCrash data is never used for Tailored experiences as described below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if you choose to send Optional diagnostic data.\nMicrosoft minimizes the volume of Optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data from only a subset of devices (sample).\nBy running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device.\nInstructions for how to download the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool can be found at <strong>Start &gt.\nSettings &gt.\nPrivacy &gt.\nDiagnostics &amp.\nfeedback</strong>.</p>\n<p>Specific data items collected in Windows diagnostics are subject to change to give Microsoft flexibility to collect the data needed for the purposes described.\nFor example, to ensure Microsoft can troubleshoot the latest performance issue impacting users\u2019 computing experience or update a Windows 10 device that is new to the market, Microsoft may need to collect data items that were not collected previously.\nFor a current list of data types collected at <strong>Required diagnostic data</strong> and <strong>Optional diagnostic data</strong>, see Windows Required (Basic level) diagnostic events and fields or Windows 10 Optional (Full level) diagnostic data.\nWe provide limited portions of error report information to partners (such as the device manufacturer) to help them troubleshoot products and services which work with Windows and other Microsoft product and services.\nThey are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those products and services.\nWe may also share some aggregated, de-identified diagnostic data, such as general usage trends for Windows apps and features, with selected third parties.\nLearn more about diagnostic data in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Inking and typing Recognition</strong>.\nYou also can choose to help Microsoft improve inking and typing recognition by sending inking and typing diagnostic data.\nIf you choose to do so, Microsoft will collect samples of the content you type or write to improve features such as handwriting recognition, autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many languages used by Windows customers.\nWhen Microsoft collects inking and typing diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original content or associate the input to you.\nIt also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary.\nLearn more about improving inking and typing in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>If you choose to turn on <strong>Tailored experiences</strong>, we will use your Windows diagnostic data (Basic or Full as you have selected) to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft experiences.\nIf you have selected Basic as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly.\nIf you have selected Full, personalization is also based on information about how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device.\nHowever, we do not use information about the websites you browse, the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data from customers who have selected Full.</p>\n<p>Tailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize Windows, as well as ads and recommendations for Microsoft and third-party products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your Windows experiences.\nFor example, to help you get the most out of your device, we may tell you about features you may not know about or that are new.\nIf you are having a problem with your Windows device, you may be offered a solution.\nYou may be offered a chance to customize your lock screen with pictures, or to be shown more pictures of the kind you like, or fewer of the ones you don\u2019t.\nIf you stream movies in your browser, you may be recommended an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently.\nOr, if you are running out of space on your hard drive, Windows may recommend you try OneDrive or purchase hardware to gain more space.\nLearn more about tailored experiences in Windows 10.</p>Feedback HubFeedback HubmainfeedbackhubmoduleSummary<p>Feedback Hub is a preinstalled app that provides a way to gather feedback on Microsoft products and installed first party and third-party apps.\nYou can sign into Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or an account provided by your organization (such as your employer or school)

if feedback is provided using your work or school account, your feedback can be viewed through the Feedback Hub by your organization\u2019s administrators.</p>\n<p>When you submit feedback to Microsoft about a problem or add more details to a problem, diagnostic data will be sent to Microsoft to improve Microsoft products and services.\nDepending on your Diagnostic data settings in <strong>Start</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Settings</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Privacy</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Diagnostics &amp.\nfeedback</strong>, Feedback Hub will either send diagnostic data automatically or you will have the option to send it to Microsoft at the time you provide feedback.\nBased on the category chosen when submitting feedback, there may be additional personal data collected that helps to further troubleshoot issues.\nfor example, location related information when submitting feedback about location services or gaze related information when submitting feedback on Mixed Reality.\nMicrosoft may also share your feedback along with the data collected when you submit your feedback with Microsoft partners (such as a device manufacturer, or firmware developer) to help them troubleshoot products and services that work with Windows and other Microsoft products and services.\nLearn more about diagnostic data in Windows 10.</p>Location services, motion sensing, and recordingLocation services, motion sensing, and recordingmainlocationservicesmotionsensingmoduleSummary<p>\n<strong>Windows location service</strong>.\nMicrosoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device.\nDepending on the capabilities of the device, the device\u2019s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely.\nWhen you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected.\nThis de-identified copy of location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see https://www.here.com/), to improve the location services of the provider.</p>\n<p>Windows services and features (such as browsers and Cortana), apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device\u2019s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so.\nSome features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device\u2019s location.\nFor information about certain Windows apps that use the device\u2019s location, see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement.</p>\n<p>When an app or feature accesses the device\u2019s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you\u2019ve granted permission.\nWe will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one).\nData about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history.\nYou can clear your device's location history at any time in the device's Settings menu.\n</p>\n<p>In Settings, you can also view which apps have access to the device\u2019s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device\u2019s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device\u2019s location.\nYou can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can\u2019t detect a more exact location for your device.</p>\n<p>Even when you\u2019ve turned off access to the device\u2019s location, some third-party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the device\u2019s precise location.\nLearn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device\u2019s location when the device\u2019s location setting is off.</p>\n<p>In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings.\nIf your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device\u2019s location.\nLearn more about location in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General Location</strong>.\nIf you turn on the General Location feature, apps that cannot use your precise location will have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Find My Phone</strong>.\nThe Find My Phone feature allows you to find the location of your Windows phone from the Microsoft account website, even if you have turned off all access to the location service on the phone.\nIf you have turned on the \"save my location every few hours\" feature in the Find My Phone settings on your phone, the Find My Phone feature will periodically send and store a single last-known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location services on your phone.\nEach time a new location is sent, it replaces the previously-stored location.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Find my device</strong>.\nThe Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows portable device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices.\nTo enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled.\nThis feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps.\nWhen the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area.\nLearn more about Find my device in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Windows motion sensing</strong>.\nWindows devices with motion activity detection can collect motion activity.\nThis data can enable features such as a pedometer to count the number of steps you take, so a fitness application can estimate how many calories you burn.\nThis data and history is stored on your device and can be accessed by applications you give permission to access and use that data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Recording</strong>.\nSome Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others.\nIf you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device.\nIn some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly.\n<strong>Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication.\nThis may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.</strong> Microsoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.</p>Security and safety featuresSecurity and safety featuresmainsecurityandsafetyfeaturesmoduleSummary<p>\n<strong>Device encryption</strong>.\nDevice encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology.\nWhen device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key.\nThe BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account.\nMicrosoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Malicious Software Removal Tool</strong>.\nThe Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update.\nMSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (\"malware\") and helps remove any infections found.\nWhen the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device.\nDuring a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device.\nIf you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Family</strong>.\nParents can use Microsoft Family to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device.\nThere are many features available to Family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you create or join a Family.\nWhen Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities.\nActivity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers after a short period of time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Defender SmartScreen</strong>.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device.\nWhen checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the download location, and the file's digital certificates.\nIf Microsoft Defender SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file.\nWhen checking web content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content.\nIf Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in Settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Defender Antivirus</strong>.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device.\nIf Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device.\nWhen Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files for further inspection.\nIf a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent.\nYou can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.</p>Speech, Voice Activation, Inking, and TypingSpeech, Voice Activation, Inking, and TypingmainspeechinkingtypingmoduleSummary<p>\n<strong>Speech</strong>.\nMicrosoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technologies.\n</p>\n<p> Turning on the online speech recognition setting lets you use Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition technologies in Cortana, the Mixed Reality Portal, dictation in Windows, supported Microsoft Store apps, and over time in other parts of Windows.\n</p>\n<p> Turning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions.\nBoth device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled.\nWith both settings enabled, while your headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input and will send your voice data to Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition technologies.\n</p>\n<p> When you use Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition technologies, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to create a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data.\nTo learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.\n</p>\n<p> You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft.\nHowever, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition technologies provide more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition.\nWhen the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that don\u2019t rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition\u2014like the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app\u2014will still work.\n</p>\n<p> If you\u2019ve given permission in Cortana, we also collect additional information, like your name and nickname, your recent calendar events, and the names of the people in your appointments, information about your contacts including names and nicknames, names of your favorite places, apps you use, and information about your music preferences.\nThis additional data enables us to better recognize people, events, places, and music when you dictate commands, messages, or documents.\n</p>\n<p> You can turn off online speech recognition at any time.\nThis will stop your voice data from being sent to Microsoft.\nIf you are using a HoloLens or mixed reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any time.\nThis will stop the device from listening for your voice input.\nLearn more about speech recognition in Windows 10.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Voice Activation</strong>.\nWindows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that app\u2014for example allowing Cortana to listen and respond to \u201cHey Cortana.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, Windows 10 will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords.\nOnce a keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer.\nThe app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to process the commands.\nEach app should ask you for permission before accessing voice recordings.</p>\n<p>Additionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked.\nIf enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who speaks near the device.\nWhen the device is locked, the app will have access to the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked.</p>\n<p> You can turn off voice activation at any time.\nLearn more about voice activation in Windows 10.\n</p>\n<p> Even when you\u2019ve turned off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services could still be listening to the microphone and collect your voice input.\nLearn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to access your microphone even with these settings turned off.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Inking &amp.\nTyping Personalization</strong>.\nYour typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you with: a personal dictionary, better character recognition to help you type and write on your device, and text suggestions that appear as you type or write.\nIf you sync your Windows device settings to other Windows devices, your local user dictionary will be stored in your personal OneDrive for the purpose of enabling sharing of your dictionary with your other Windows devices.\nLearn more about

&amp.\nSupport.</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a.\n<strong>Microsoft account.</strong> You\u2019ll need a Microsoft account to access many of the Services.\nYour Microsoft account lets you sign in to products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners.\n<ul>\n<li>i.\n<strong>Creating an Account.</strong> You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online.\nYou agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account.\nIn some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you.\nIf you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account.\nPlease review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms.\nIf you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.\nYou cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity.\nTo protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential.\nYou are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.</li>\n<li>ii.\n<strong>Account Use.</strong> You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active.\nThis means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services.\nIf you don\u2019t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you.\nPlease see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account.\nYou must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.\nYou must sign into the Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account.\nIf we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership.\nBased on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content.\nIf you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656.</li>\n<li>iii.\n<strong>Kids and Accounts.</strong> By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and represent that you have either reached the age of \u201cmajority\u201d where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.\nIf you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help.\nIf you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor\u2019s account is now open or created later.</li>\n<li>iv.\n<strong>Closing Your Account.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>1.\nYou can cancel specific Services or close your Microsoft account at any time and for any reason.\nTo close your Microsoft account, please visit https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx.\nWhen you ask us to close your Microsoft account, we will put it in a suspended state for 60 days just in case you change your mind.\nAfter that 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed.\nPlease see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed.\nLogging back in during that 60-day period will reactivate your Microsoft account.</li>\n<li>2.\nIf your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen.\nFirst, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately.\nSecond, we\u2019ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).\nYou should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won\u2019t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed.\nThird, you may lose access to products you\u2019ve acquired.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>b.\n<strong>Work or School

notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised.\nYou further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization and these Terms may not apply.\nIf you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.\n</li>\n<li>c.\n<strong>Additional Equipment/Data Plans.</strong> To use many of the Services, you\u2019ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan.\nYou might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone.\nYou are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and

may apply to you.\n</li>\n<li>d.\n<strong>Service Notifications.</strong> When there\u2019s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we\u2019ll send you Service notifications.\nIf you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases.\nWe may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages).\n<strong>Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>e.\n<strong>Support.</strong> Customer support for some Services is available at

us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your license to the software related to the Services ends.\nSecond, we\u2019ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).\nAs a result you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you\u2019ve stored on those Services).\nYou should have a regular backup plan.\nThird, you may lose access to products you\u2019ve acquired.\nIf you have canceled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be canceled immediately.\n</li>\n</ul>Top of

close his or her Microsoft account.</li>\n<li>b.\nSometimes you\u2019ll need software updates to keep using the Services.\nWe may automatically check your version of the software and download software updates or configuration changes.\nYou may also be required to update the software to continue using the Services.\nSuch updates are subject to these Terms unless other terms accompany the updates, in which case, those other terms apply.\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t obligated to make any updates available and we don\u2019t guarantee that we will support the version of the system or device for which you

your purchase and you agree to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a.\n<strong>Charges.</strong> If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge.\nThe price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise.\nThe price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes.\nYou are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.\nTaxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered.\nWe may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you.\nSuspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content.\nConnecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.</li>\n<li>b.\n<strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.\nYou can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing into your account portal at https://skype.com/go/myaccount.\nAdditionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network.\nYou agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions.\nChanges made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.</li>\n<li>c.\n<strong>Billing.</strong> By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate.\n(ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method.\nand (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force.\nWe may bill you (a) in advance.\n(b) at the time of purchase.\n(c) shortly after purchase.\nor (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services.\nAlso, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services.\nWe may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.</li>\n<li>d.\n<strong>Recurring Payments.</strong> When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft.\nYou must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services.\nWe will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services.\nBy authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, <strong>\"Electronic Payments\"</strong>).\nSubscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period.\nIf any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.</li>\n<li>e.\n<strong>Online Statement and Errors.</strong> Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the Microsoft account management website

(https://www.skype.com).\nThis is the only billing statement that we provide.\nIf we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill.\nWe will then promptly investigate the charge.\nIf you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund.\nIf Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days.</li>\n<li>f.\n<strong>Refund Policy.</strong> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nFor more refund information, please visit our help topic (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283).</li>\n<li>g.\n<strong>Canceling the Services.</strong> You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause.\nCancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service.\nTo cancel a Service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website.\nYou can request a refund from Skype using the Cancellation and Refund form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286).\nYou should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation.\n(ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges.\n(iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation.\nand (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services.\nWe will process your Data as described above in section 4.\nIf you cancel, your access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled.</li>\n<li>h.\n<strong>Trial-Period Offers.</strong> If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period.</li>\n<li>i.\n<strong>Promotional Offers.</strong> From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services.\nMicrosoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion)

products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners.\n<ul>\n<li>i.\n<strong>Creating an Account.</strong> You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online.\nYou agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account.\nIn some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you.\nIf you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account.\nPlease review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms.\nIf you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.\nYou cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity.\nTo protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential.\nYou are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.</li>\n<li>ii.\n<strong>Account Use.</strong> You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active.\nThis means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services.\nIf you don\u2019t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you.\nPlease see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account.\nYou must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.\nYou must sign into the Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account.\nIf we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership.\nBased on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content.\nIf you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656.</li>\n<li>iii.\n<strong>Kids and Accounts.</strong> By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and represent that you have either reached the age of \u201cmajority\u201d where you live or your parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.\nIf you do not know whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help.\nIf you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor\u2019s account is now open or

your mind.\nAfter that 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed.\nPlease see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed.\nLogging

Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately.\nSecond, we\u2019ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).\nYou should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won\u2019t be

products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners.\n<ul>\n<li>i.\n<strong>Creating an Account.</strong> You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online.\nYou agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account.\nIn some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you.\nIf you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account.\nPlease review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms.\nIf you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.\nYou cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity.\nTo protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential.\nYou are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.</li>\n<li>ii.\n<strong>Account

unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services.\nIf you don\u2019t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you.\nPlease see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account.\nYou must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.\nYou must sign into the Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account.\nIf we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership.\nBased on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content.\nIf you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656.</li>\n<li>iii.\n<strong>Kids and Accounts.</strong> By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these

your mind.\nAfter that 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed.\nPlease see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed.\nLogging back in during that 60-day period will reactivate your Microsoft account.</li>\n<li>2.\nIf your Microsoft account is closed (whether by you or us), a few things happen.\nFirst, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately.\nSecond, we\u2019ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).\nYou should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won\u2019t be able to retrieve Your Content or Data once your account is closed.\nThird, you may lose access to products you\u2019ve acquired.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>b.\n<strong>Work or School

notified of the existence of your Microsoft account and its associated subscriptions, control and administer your account, and access and process your Data, including the contents of your communications and files, and that Microsoft may notify the owner of the domain if the account or Data is compromised.\nYou further agree that your use of the Microsoft services may be subject to the agreements Microsoft has with you or your organization and these Terms may not apply.\nIf you already have a Microsoft account and you use a separate work or school email address to access Services covered under these Terms, you may be prompted to update the email address associated with your Microsoft account in order to continue accessing such Services.\n</li>\n<li>c.\n<strong>Additional Equipment/Data Plans.</strong> To use many of the Services, you\u2019ll need an internet connection and/or data/cellular plan.\nYou might also need additional equipment, like a headset, camera or microphone.\nYou are responsible for providing all connections, plans, and equipment needed to use the Services and for paying the fees charged by the provider(s) of your connections, plans, and equipment.\nThose fees are in addition to any fees you pay us for the Services and we will not reimburse you for such fees.\nCheck with your provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you.\n</li>\n<li>d.\n<strong>Service Notifications.</strong> When there\u2019s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we\u2019ll send you Service notifications.\nIf you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or via SMS (text message), including to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and verifying your purchases.\nWe may also send you Service notifications by other means (for example by in-product messages).\n<strong>Data or messaging rates may apply when receiving notifications via SMS.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>e.\n<strong>Support.</strong> Customer support for some Services is available at https://support.microsoft.com.\nCertain Services may offer separate or additional customer support, subject to the terms available at www.microsoft.com/support-service-agreement, unless otherwise specified.\nSupport may not be available for preview or beta versions of features or Services.\n</li>\n<li>f.\n<strong>Ending your Services.</strong> If your Services are canceled (whether by you or us), first your right to access the Services stops immediately and your license to the software related to the Services ends.\nSecond, we\u2019ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).\nAs a result you may no longer be able to access any of the Services (or Your Content that you\u2019ve stored on those Services).\nYou should have a regular backup plan.\nThird, you may lose access to products you\u2019ve acquired.\nIf you have canceled your Microsoft account and have no other account able to access the Services your Services may be canceled immediately.\n</li>\n</ul>Top of

your purchase and you agree to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a.\n<strong>Charges.</strong> If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge.\nThe price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise.\nThe price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes.\nYou are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.\nTaxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered.\nWe may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you.\nSuspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content.\nConnecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.</li>\n<li>b.\n<strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.\nYou can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing into your account portal at https://skype.com/go/myaccount.\nAdditionally, you agree to permit Microsoft to use any updated account information regarding your selected payment method provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network.\nYou agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and payment method details, so we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed in connection with your transactions.\nChanges made to your billing account will not affect charges we submit to your billing account before we could reasonably act on your changes to your billing account.</li>\n<li>c.\n<strong>Billing.</strong> By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate.\n(ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method.\nand (iii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for any paid feature of the Services you choose to sign up for or use while these Terms are in force.\nWe may bill you (a) in advance.\n(b) at the time of purchase.\n(c) shortly after purchase.\nor (d) on a recurring basis for subscription Services.\nAlso, we may charge you up to the amount you have approved, and we will notify you in advance of any change in the amount to be charged for recurring subscription Services.\nWe may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.</li>\n<li>d.\n<strong>Recurring Payments.</strong> When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft.\nYou must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services.\nWe will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services.\nBy authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, <strong>\"Electronic Payments\"</strong>).\nSubscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period.\nIf any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.</li>\n<li>e.\n<strong>Online Statement and Errors.</strong> Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618282), where you can view and print your statement.\nFor Skype, you can access your online statement by signing into your account at www.skype.com (https://www.skype.com).\nThis is the only billing statement that we provide.\nIf we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill.\nWe will then promptly investigate the charge.\nIf you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund.\nIf Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days.</li>\n<li>f.\n<strong>Refund Policy.</strong> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nFor more refund information, please visit our help topic (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283).</li>\n<li>g.\n<strong>Canceling the Services.</strong> You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause.\nCancelling paid Services stops future charges to continue the Service.\nTo cancel a Service and request a refund, if you are entitled to one, visit the Microsoft account management website.\nYou can request a refund from Skype using the Cancellation and Refund form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286).\nYou should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time of cancellation.\n(ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges.\n(iii) you may be obligated to pay all charges made to your billing account for the Services before the date of cancellation.\nand (iv) you may lose access to and use of your account when you cancel the Services.\nWe will process your Data as described above in section 4.\nIf you cancel, your access to the Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled.</li>\n<li>h.\n<strong>Trial-Period Offers.</strong> If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period.</li>\n<li>i.\n<strong>Promotional Offers.</strong> From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services.\nMicrosoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.</li>\n<li>j.\n<strong>Price Changes.</strong> We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change.\nIf you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect.\nIf there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.</li>\n<li>k.\n<strong>Payments to You.</strong> If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you.\nYou are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this payment to you.\nYou must also comply with any other conditions we place on your right to any payment.\nIf you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require return of the payment.\nYou agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this.\nWe may reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.</li>\n<li>l.\n<strong>Gift Cards.</strong> Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions (https://support.microsoft.com/help/10562/microsoft-account-gift-card-terms-and-conditions).\nInformation on Skype gift cards is available on Skype\u2019s Help page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383).</li>\n<li>m.\n<strong>Bank Account Payment Method.</strong> You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method.\nEligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house (\"<strong>ACH</strong>\") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area (\"<strong>SEPA</strong>\") or \"iDEAL\" in the Netherlands).\nTerms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the \u201cmandate\u201d in the case of SEPA) also apply.\nYou represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a payment method.\nBy registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits.\nYou understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account.\nContact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error.\nLaws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions from your bank account.\nBy registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to these Terms.</li>\n</ul>Top of pageContracting Entity, Choice of Law, JurisdictionContracting Entity, Choice of Law, Jurisdiction<p>10.\n<strong>Contracting

purchase a Service, then these payment terms apply to your purchase and you agree to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a.\n<strong>Charges.</strong> If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge.\nThe price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise.\nThe price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes.\nYou are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.\nTaxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered.\nWe may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you.\nSuspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content.\nConnecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.</li>\n<li>b.\n<strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.\nYou can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing

act on your changes to your billing account.</li>\n<li>c.\n<strong>Billing.</strong> By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate.\n(ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method.\nand (iii)

recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft.\nYou must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services.\nWe will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services.\nBy authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, <strong>\"Electronic Payments\"</strong>).\nSubscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period.\nIf any payment is returned unpaid or if any credit card or similar transaction is rejected or denied, Microsoft or its service providers reserve the right to collect any applicable return item, rejection or insufficient funds fee and process any such payment as an Electronic Payment.</li>\n<li>e.\n<strong>Online Statement and Errors.</strong> Microsoft will provide you with an online billing statement on the Microsoft account management website

(https://www.skype.com).\nThis is the only billing statement that we provide.\nIf we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill.\nWe will then promptly investigate the charge.\nIf you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund.\nIf Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days.</li>\n<li>f.\n<strong>Refund Policy.</strong> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nFor more refund information, please visit our help topic (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283).</li>\n<li>g.\n<strong>Canceling the Services.</strong> You may cancel a Service at any time, with or without cause.\nCancelling paid Services stops

using the Cancellation and Refund form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618286).\nYou should refer back to the offer describing the Services as (i) you may not receive a refund at the time

Offers.</strong> If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period.</li>\n<li>i.\n<strong>Promotional Offers.</strong> From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services.\nMicrosoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.</li>\n<li>j.\n<strong>Price Changes.</strong> We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change.\nIf you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect.\nIf there is a fixed term and price for your Service offer, that price will remain in force for the fixed term.</li>\n<li>k.\n<strong>Payments to You.</strong> If we owe you a payment, then you agree to timely and accurately provide us with any information we need to get that payment to you.\nYou are responsible for any taxes and charges you may incur as a result of this

to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this.\nWe may reduce the payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.</li>\n<li>l.\n<strong>Gift Cards.</strong> Redemption and use of gift cards (other than Skype gift cards) are governed by the Microsoft Gift Card Terms and Conditions

(https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383).</li>\n<li>m.\n<strong>Bank Account Payment Method.</strong> You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method.\nEligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house (\"<strong>ACH</strong>\") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area (\"<strong>SEPA</strong>\") or \"iDEAL\" in the Netherlands).\nTerms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the \u201cmandate\u201d in the case of SEPA) also apply.\nYou represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a payment method.\nBy registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits.\nYou understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account.\nContact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error.\nLaws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions from your bank account.\nBy registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you
