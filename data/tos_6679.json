you do not link your financial account to the Services, you cannot claim rewards.\nYou may also upload a profile photo to your account.</p>\n<p>If you sign up for early access to Paceline on our Site, we will collect your name, email address, and information about the types of wearable fitness devices and credit cards you use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Wearable Device</strong>\n</p>\n<p>With your

some of your activity information.&nbsp.\nPlease see your device settings for details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Financial Accounts</strong>\n</p>\n<p>With your consent and in order to provide you with more relevant rewards, we will collect information about your financial account transactions from accounts that you link to your Paceline account through Plaid Inc.\n(\u201cPlaid\u201d).&nbsp.\nTo do so, you will need to enter your online credentials for your financial accounts with Plaid, and by doing so, you acknowledge and agree that the terms of Plaid\u2019s Privacy Policy (currently located at https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy), not this Policy, will govern Plaid\u2019s use of such information, and you expressly agree to the terms and conditions of Plaid\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nFurther, you expressly grant Plaid the right, power, and authority to access and transmit your information as reasonably necessary for Plaid to provide the financial account linking services to you.\n<strong>\n<em>Please note that Plaid is an independent third party.&nbsp.\nPaceline has no control over Plaid\u2019s use of your information.\nIf you do not agree to Plaid\u2019s use of your

months of transaction information from the financial accounts you have linked to Plaid and agreed to provide to us.\n&nbsp;The information we receive from the entities that maintain your accounts varies depending on the information made available by those entities \u2013 for example, if you have a checking and credit card account under the online banking login you provide, we will collect transaction information from both the checking and credit card accounts.\nInformation we collect through this process typically includes the stores and merchants you purchase from, the amounts you spend, your account type, and your spending limit(s).&nbsp.\nPlease note that, with respect to financial accounts that you choose to link to your Paceline account through Plaid, we never see your full credit card number, your financial account credentials (username and password), or the specific item(s) that you purchase from a store or merchant.\nWe also cannot make any changes to any accounts that you link to, cannot initiate transactions, or do anything other than view transaction information and account data.</p>\n<p>We will continue to collect transaction information from your financial accounts until you unlink your financial accounts from your Paceline account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Credit Card Rewards Program</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you apply and are approved to be a Paceline cardholder, we may receive information about you from our credit card processing&nbsp;and issuing&nbsp;partner&nbsp;or other rewards partners&nbsp;in connection with the administration of the credit card and credit card rewards program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Information we may receive from those entities may include&nbsp;your name, the transactions you make, and whether your account is in good standing so that we are able to apply the appropriate&nbsp;credit card rewards to your Paceline account.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not have access to your full credit card number, account login credentials, or lists of the specific item(s) that you purchase from a store or merchant.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Location Information</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We and our service providers may collect location

rights.</p>\n<p>Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to a user\u2019s satisfaction by contacting us at&nbsp;our Support page.&nbsp.\nThis Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Company.&nbsp.\nArbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.&nbsp.\nYou have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</p>\n<p>Please read this Provision carefully.&nbsp.\nIt provides that all Disputes between you and Company shall be resolved by binding arbitration.&nbsp.\nArbitration replaces the right to go to court.&nbsp.\nIn the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).&nbsp.\nExcept as otherwise provided, entering into these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.&nbsp.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney\u2019s fees).</p>\n<p>For the purpose of this Provision, \u201cCompany\u201d means Company and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.&nbsp.\nThe term \u201cDispute\u201d means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Company regarding, arising out of or relating to any aspect of your relationship with Company, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable cause of action or claim for relief, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).&nbsp.\n\u201cDispute\u201d is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Company\u2019s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>\n<p>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p>\n<p>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</p>\n<p>For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Company an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.&nbsp.\nYou must commence this process by mailing written notification to TAM(Squared) Inc., 353 Sacramento St., San Francisco, CA 94111.\nThat written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.&nbsp.\nIf Company does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.&nbsp.\nYou may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>\n<p>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or Company may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court.\nor (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (the \u201cOpt-Out Deadline\u201d).&nbsp.\nYou may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to TAM(Squared) Inc., 353 Sacramento St., San Francisco, CA 94111.&nbsp.\nYour written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Company through arbitration.&nbsp.\nYour decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Company.&nbsp.\nAny opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Procedures</p>\n<p>If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or Company may initiate arbitration proceedings.&nbsp.\nThe American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration only, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration or a consolidated or representative action or arbitration.\nAll issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.</p>\n<p>For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.\nfor Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.&nbsp.\nIn either instance, the AAA\u2019s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.&nbsp.\nThe AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp.\nFor arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.&nbsp.\nThe JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.&nbsp.\nThis Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.&nbsp.\nUnder no circumstances will class action or representative action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>\n<p>Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.&nbsp.\nHowever, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Award \u2013 The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party or if required by applicable law.\nSuch award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA or other applicable law, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>\n<p>Location of Arbitration \u2013 You or Company may initiate arbitration in either San Francisco County, California or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.</p>\n<p>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs \u2013 Company will pay all arbitration filing fees and AAA or JAMS hearing fees and any arbitrator\u2019s hearing fees, costs and expenses upon your written request to the arbitrator given at or before the first evidentiary hearing in the arbitration.\nYou are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.&nbsp.\nFees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.&nbsp.\nIn addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Company as provided in the section above titled \u201cPre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\u201d and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Class Action Waiver</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action, representative action, or private attorney general action) unless both you and Company specifically agree to do so in writing following initiation of the arbitration.&nbsp.\nIf you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.&nbsp.\nNeither you, nor any other user of the Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>\n<p>Jury Waiver</p>\n<p>You understand and agree that by entering into these Terms you and Company are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.&nbsp.\nIn the absence of this Provision, you and Company might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).&nbsp.\nExcept as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.&nbsp.\nOther rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Severability</b>\n</p>\n<p>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect.&nbsp.\nIf the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>\n<p>Continuation</p>\n<p>This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with Company or its affiliates.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, the parties agree that if Company makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change and require Company to adhere to the present language in this Provision if a dispute between the parties arises.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Termination</b>.</p>\n<p>You may discontinue your use of the Service at any time by removing the Mobile Application from your mobile device.&nbsp.\nIn addition, you may delete your account and terminate these Terms by emailing Company at&nbsp;our Support page.</p>\n<p>The Company may at any time, in its sole discretion, terminate these Terms, or suspend or terminate your account for any reason.</p>\n<p>The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<b>General.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Company prefers to advise you if Company feels you are not complying with these Terms and to recommend any necessary corrective action.&nbsp.\nHowever, certain violations of these Terms, as determined by Company, may result in immediate termination of your access to the Service without prior notice to you.&nbsp.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act, California state law and applicable U.S.\nfederal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms.&nbsp.\nForeign laws do not apply.&nbsp.\nThe United Nations on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and any laws based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) shall not apply to this Agreement.\n&nbsp;Except for Disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or the Service will be heard in the courts located in San Francisco County in the State of California.&nbsp.\nIf any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified.&nbsp.\nCompany\u2019s failure to enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such term.&nbsp.\nThese Terms are the entire agreement between you and Company and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between you and Company about the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Contact Us.</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about these Terms or otherwise need to contact Company for any reason, you can
