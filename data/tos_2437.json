Sprint, T-Mobile, Cellular One, US Cellular, Boost, Virgin, MetroPCS, Cricket, Alltel.\nPoll Everywhere is not primarily an SMS marketing or campaign management tool, it is a data collection tool.\nRegardless, Poll Everywhere will conform to current Mobile Marketing Association Best Practices.\n</p>\n<p>\n(i) Reselling the Service:\nYou may \"resell\" the Service by offering a service to third parties that incorporate the Service, provided that (i) your service includes substantial additional value beyond the Service, such that your customers do not purchase your service primarily to

and (iii) you: (1) must purchase separate Accounts for each client, project, or other use.\nor (2) must subscribe to a Custom Plan if you want to do multi-tenancy in which a single Account or login is to be used with multiple, separate third parties (see plans and pricing for more details).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, you may not use a single Account or login for multiple, separate third party entities if you have not subscribed to a Custom Plan, and any attempt to do so may result in additional charges to your Account and/or termination of your Account, at the discretion of Poll Everywhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n(j) Educational Institution Subscribers:\nSubscribers that are educational institutions or any subdivision thereof, such as an entire department (e.g.\nDepartment of Political Science or Science Department, etc.) or school (e.g., Business School, School of Engineering or School of Medicine, etc.), but excluding cases in which teachers or professors open an account for a single class, are charged a subscription fee based on the number of individual students that are eligible to be Poll Participants.\nTherefore, if Subscriber is an educational institution, each individual student who will be a Poll Participant must register under the applicable Subscriber\u2019s account.\nEach registered student may access and use the Services as a Poll Participant from an unlimited number of devices.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Subscriber may, on a student-by-student basis, provide students with the option to not register under Subscriber\u2019s account.\nThe parties agree that for each student that elects not to register under Subscriber\u2019s account, one individual student license will be converted to a license that permits the Service to be accessed and used by 1.5 devices.\nTeachers, professors and their assistants are not required to register in order to be Poll Participants, but may need to register as Authorized Users in order to configure and conduct polls using the Service.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn addition, on a case by case basis and with approval from Subscriber\u2019s account manager at Poll Everywhere, Subscriber may conduct polls for one-off events such as conferences, which include an additional number of Poll Participants that are not registered students that is equal to the number of registered students for which Subscriber has purchased a license.\nFinally, Subscriber may add and/or remove registered students twice each calendar year, in order to account for turnover in the student population.\n</p>\n2.\nPROPRIETARY

purpose without the specific written permission of Poll Everywhere.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, use of the Site or Service does not grant you a license to any Content, features or materials you may access on the Site or through the Service.\nAs between you and Poll Everywhere (or other company whose marks appear on the Site), Poll Everywhere (or the respective company) is the owner
