performed entirely therein, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions, except to the extent that law is inconsistent with or preempted by federal law.\nTo the extent that a dispute is not subject to arbitration under Section 12 (Dispute Resolution) of this Agreement, that action shall be brought in the appropriate state or federal court located in New York County, New York.\nand we both irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in New York County, New York for the adjudication of all non-arbitral claims.<strong>11.\nSeverability.</strong>Except as specified in Section 12 (Dispute Resolution), if any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable for this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\nThis is the entire agreement between the parties relating to the matters contained herein.<strong>12.\nDispute Resolution.</strong>Summary:Our customer-service department can resolve most customer concerns quickly and to the customer's satisfaction.\nPlease contact CNN at cnn.com/feedback.\n<strong>In the unlikely event that you're not satisfied with customer service's solution (or if CNN has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.\n</strong>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nUnless expressly limited by this Dispute Resolution provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\n<strong>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis.\nclass arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</strong> For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all costs of the arbitration.\nMoreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from us to at least the same extent as you would be in court.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), we will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what we have offered you to settle the dispute.<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>\n<strong>(1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: </strong>CNN and you agree to arbitrate <strong>all disputes</strong>\n<strong> and claims</strong> between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners).\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes, but is not limited to:<ul>\n<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory;</li>\n<li>claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>\n<li>claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury;</li>\n<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.\nand</li>\n<li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n</li>\n</ul>References to \"CNN,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises.\nour respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns (including AT&amp;T and its affiliates).\nand all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an action in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action remains in that court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\n<strong>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action</strong>.\nThis Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n<strong>(2) Pre-Arbitration Notice of Disputes:</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\").\nThe Notice to CNN should be sent by certified mail to: General Counsel, WarnerMedia News &amp.\nSports, 1 CNN Center, Atlanta, GA 30303 (\"Notice Address\").\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nIf we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by us or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or us is entitled.\nYou may download a form to initiate arbitration at: adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf.<strong>(3) Arbitration Procedure:</strong> The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (\"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by this arbitration provision, and will be administered by the AAA.\n(If the AAA is unavailable, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties or by the court.) The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or whether a dispute can or must be brought in arbitration are for the court to decide.\nThe arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.\nUnless we and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nExcept as provided in subsection (6) below, the arbitrator can award the same damages and individualized relief that a court can award under applicable law.<strong>(4) Arbitration Fees</strong>: After we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, we will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000 in value.\n(The filing fee currently is $200 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.\nIf you are unable to pay this fee, we will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) We will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.\nIf, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies we previously paid that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nIn addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at greater than $75,000 (either to you or to us), the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.<strong>(5) Alternative Payment and Attorney Premium:</strong> If you initiated arbitration in accordance with the notice requirements above in subsection (2) and the arbitrator issues an award in your favor that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then we will:<ul>\n<li>pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 (\"the alternative payment\"), whichever is greater.\nand </li>\n<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").</li>\n</ul>If we did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\nIn assessing whether an award that includes attorneys' fees or expenses is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer, the calculation shall include only the portion of the award representing attorneys' fees or expenses that you reasonably incurred pursuing the arbitration through the date of our settlement offer.The right to the attorney premium supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law.\nThus, if you would be entitled to a
