names.\nNo fee refund will be made when there is a suspension or termination of Service(s) for cause.\nAt any time and for any reason, we may terminate the Services 30 days after we send notice of termination via mail or email, at our option, to the account contact information provided in association with your account registration.\nFollowing notice of termination other than for cause, you must transfer your domain name or risk that we may delete your domain name or suspend or modify Services to it.\nIf we terminate Services for a reason other than cause, we will attempt to refund your

procedures approved by an ICANN-adopted policy, to correct mistakes by us, another registrar or the registry administrator in administering the domain name or for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name.</p>OUR SERVICES:<p>Domain name registrations are not effective until the registry administrator puts them into effect.\nFor a list of registry administrators and for more information on TLDs, see HYPERLINK http://www.icann.org/tlds/.\nDomain name registrations are only for limited terms, terms that end on the expiration date.\nFor domain names which are created as a new registration out of the available namespace, the term begins on the date the domain name registration is acknowledged by the applicable registry.\nfor domain names registrations which were not returned to the available namespace, the term begins on the date the previous registrant\u2019s domain name registration was acknowledged by the applicable registry.\nYou agree that we are not liable or responsible in any way for any errors, omissions or any other actions by the registry administrator arising out of or related to a request to register, renew, modify the settings for, or transfer of a domain name registration (our limitation of liability is explained further, below).\nYou further agree that domain name registration is a service, that domain name registrations do not exist independently from services provided pursuant to this or a similar registration agreement with a registrar, and that domain name registration services do not create a property interest.\nYOU WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES IS NOT GOING TO SUBJECT US TO ANY CLAIM(S).\nYou further agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us, and applicable registry administrator(s) (including Verisign Inc., Neulevel, Inc., Public Interest Registry, Afilias Limited, and other registry operators listed at http://www.icann.org/registries/listing.html) and all such parties\u2019 directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages and reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of, or related to, the domain name registration services you are obtaining from us.\nRegistered domains can be used with JavaPipe\u2019s web hosting or other internal or external hosting services.</p>NOT INCLUDED IN THE SERVICES:<p>Without limitation, the following are not included in the Services: We cannot and do not check to see whether the domain name(s) you select, or the use you make of the domain name(s), or other of the Service(s), infringes legal rights of others.\nIt is your responsibility to know whether or not the domain name(s) you select or use infringes legal rights of others.\nWe might be ordered by a court to cancel, modify, or transfer your domain name.\nit is your responsibility to list accurate contact information in association with your account and to communicate with litigants, potential litigants, and governmental authorities.\nIt is not our responsibility to forward court orders or other communications to you.\nWe will comply with court orders unless you contact us to contest the order.</p>IF LAWSUIT(S) ARE THREATENED:<p>If we are sued or threatened with lawsuit in connection with Service(s) provided to you, we may turn to

performance bond with a reputable bonding company or, if you are unable to obtain a performance bond, that you will deposit money with us to pay for our reasonably anticipated expenses in relation to the matter for the coming year.\nSuch deposit will be drawn down as expenses are incurred, with all account notices sent to the WHOIS contact information provided in association with your domain names and/or account.\nWe shall not be obliged to extend you any credit in relation to such expenses and we may terminate the Services for a failure to make or renew such a deposit.\nWe will return any unused deposit upon the later of one year from deposit or the conclusion of the matter.</p>DISPUTE RESOLUTION POLICY:<p>You agree to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (\u201cUDRP\u201d), which is available at http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-rules-24oct99.htm and http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm .\nYou agree that the UDRP may be changed by ICANN (or ICANN\u2019s successor) at any time.\nYou agree that, if the registration or reservation of your domain name is challenged by a third party, you will be subject to the provisions specified in the Dispute Policy in effect at the time your domain name registration is disputed by the third party.\nYou also agree that, in the event a domain name dispute arises with any third party, you will indemnify and hold us harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions of the UDRP.\nYou also understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and domain names because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding Services provided to you, you may loose your rights to receive the Services if you do not respond expeditiously to an email sent in conjunction therewith.</p>FEES:<p>All domain name registrations and renewal sales are final.\nAs consideration for the Service(s), renewal of the Service(s), and, if you select it, automatic renewal of the Service(s), you agree to pay, prior to the effectiveness of the desired Service(s), the applicable Service(s) fees.\nAll fees are non-refundable, in whole or in part, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled or transferred prior to the end of your then current registration term, unless this Agreement specifically provides for a refund.\nAt our option, we may require that you pay fees through a particular payment means (such as by credit card or by wire transfer) or that you change from one payment provider to another.</p>CREDIT CARD AND OTHER CHARGES:<p>If you have an issue with credit card charges, you should contact us regarding the issue before you contact your credit card company to request a charge back or reversal of the charges.\nIn the event of a charge back by a credit card company (or similar action by another payment provider allowed by us) in connection with your payment of fees for any Service(s), you agree that we may suspend access to any and all accounts you have with us and/or and that all rights to and interest in and use of any domain name registration(s) services, website hosting, and/or email services, including all data hosted on our systems and/or on the systems of your Primary Service Provider shall be assumed by us or, as the case may be.\nWe will reinstate your rights to and control over these Services solely at our discretion, and subject to our receipt of the unpaid fee(s) and our then-current reinstatement fee, currently set at $200(US Dollars).\nEXPIRATION AND RENEWAL OF SERVICE(S): You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your own records and to maintain your own reminders regarding when your domain name registration or other Services are set to expire.\nAs a convenience to you, and not as a binding commitment, we may notify you via an email message or via your account when renewal fees are due.\nShould these fees go unpaid, your Services will expire or be cancelled.\nPayment must be made by credit card or such other method as we may allow or require from time to time.\nIf you select automatic renewal of the Service(s), we may attempt to renew the Service(s) a reasonable time before expiration, provided your credit card or other billing information is available and up to date.\nYou acknowledge that it is your responsibility to keep your billing information up to date and that we are not required to, but that we may, contact you to update this information in the event that an attempted transaction is not processed successfully.\n*Please note: for certain TLDs, the automatic renewal option is not available.</p>ACCOUNT CONTACT INFORMATION AND DOMAIN NAME WHOIS INFORMATION:<p>As further consideration for the Service(s), you agree to provide certain current, complete and accurate information about you, both with respect to your account information and with respect to the WHOIS information for your domain name(s).\nYou agree to maintain and update this information as needed to keep it current, complete and accurate.\nWith respect to you, the administrative, technical, and billing contacts for your domain name registration(s) and other Service(s), you must submit the following: name, postal address, e-mail address, voice telephone number, and where available, fax number.\nYou agree that the type of information you are required to provide may change and you understand that, if you do not provide the newly required information, your registration or and/or other Service(s) may be suspended or terminated or may not be renewed.\nNot providing requested information may prevent you from obtaining all Service(s).\nYou may provide information regarding the name-servers assigned to your domain name(s) and, if we are providing name-server services to you, the DNS settings for the domain name.\nIf you do not provide complete name-server information, or if you purchase \u201cName Only\u201d Services, you agree that we may supply this information (and point your domain name to a website of our choosing) until such time as you elect to supply the name-server information or until such time as you elect to upgrade from \u201cName Only\u201d Services.</p>YOUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS RELATING TO THE ACCOUNT AND WHOIS CONTACT INFORMATION:<p>In the event that, in registering a domain name or obtaining other Service(s), you provide information about or on behalf of a third party, you represent that you have (a) provided notice to that third party of the disclosure and use of that party\u2019s information as set forth in this Agreement, and (b) that you have obtained the third party\u2019s express consent to the disclosure and use of that party\u2019s information as set forth in this Agreement.\nBy registering a domain name or applying for other Service(s) you also represent that the statements in your application are true and you also represent that the domain name is not being registered or the Services being procured for any unlawful purpose.\nYou acknowledge that providing inaccurate information or failing to update information promptly will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Services to you.\nYou further agree that your failure to respond for over ten (10) calendar days to inquiries by us concerning the accuracy of account and WHOIS contact information shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement and will be sufficient basis for suspension or termination of Service(s) to you.\nAs indicated elsewhere in this Agreement, you understand that it is important for you to regularly monitor email sent to the email address associated with your account and WHOIS contact information because, among other reasons, if a dispute arises regarding a domain name(s) or other Service(s), you may loose your rights to the domain name(s) or your right to receive the Service(s) if you do not respond appropriately to an email sent in conjunction therewith.</p>ACCESSING YOUR ACCOUNT AND AN IMPORTANT LIMITATION OF OUR LIABILITY:<p>In order to change any of your account or domain name WHOIS information, you must access your account with your Primary Service Provider (if any), or your account with us.\nPlease safeguard your account login identifier and password from any unauthorized use.\nYou agree that any person in possession of you account login identifier and password will have the ability and your authorization to modify your account and domain name information.\nWe will take reasonable precautions to protect the information we obtain from you from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction of that information and that such reasonable precautions include procedures for releasing account access information to parties who claim to have lost account access information.\nYou agree that, if we take reasonable precautions in relation thereto, that IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE IF SUCH REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS DO NOT PREVENT THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR ACCOUNT IDENTIFIER OR PASSWORD AND THAT, EVEN IF WE FAIL TO TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS, THAT OUR LIABILITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL BE LIMITED BY THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVISION FOUND BELOW IN THIS AGREEMENT.\nIf you contact us alleging that a third party has unauthorized access to your account or domain names, you agree that we may charge you administrative fees of $50 (US dollars) per hour for our time spent in relation to the matter, regardless of whether or not we return control over the account and/or domain names to you.</p>TRANSFERS:<p>You agree that transfer of your domain name(s) services shall be governed by ICANN\u2019s transfer policy, available at http://www.icann.org/transfers/, as this policy may be modified from time to time.\nYou agree that we may place a \u201cRegistrar Lock\u201d on your domain name services and that this will prevent your domain name services from being transferred without your authorization, though we are not required to do so.\nBy allowing your domain name services to remain locked, you provide express objection to any and all transfer requests until the lock is removed.\nTo transfer your domain name(s) you should first login to your account to lock or unlock your domain name(s) and/or to obtain the EPP \u201cAuthCode\u201d which is required to transfer domain services in an EPP registry (such as .org).\nOnly the registrant and the administrative contacts listed in the WHOIS information may approve or deny a transfer request.\nWithout limitation, domain name services may not be transferred within 60 days of initial registration, within 60 days of a transfer, if there is a dispute regarding the identity of the domain name registrant, if you are bankrupt, or if you fail to pay fees when due.\nWe will follow the procedures for both gaining and loosing registrars as outlined in ICANN\u2019s transfer policies.\nTransfer requests typically take five business days to be processed.\nA transfer will not be processed if, during this time, the domain name registration services expire in which event you may need to reinstate the transfer request.\nYou may be required to resubmit a transfer request if there is a communication failure or other problem at either our end or at the registry.\nAS A CONSEQUENCE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR FAILURE OF A TRANSFER IF THE TRANSFER PROCESS IS INITIATED CLOSE TO THE END OF A REGISTRATION TERM.</p>PRIVACY POLICY:<p>You agree and consent that we will make available the domain name registration information you provide or that we otherwise maintain to the following parties: ICANN, the registry administrator(s), and to other third parties as ICANN and applicable laws may require or permit (including through web-based and other on-line WHOIS lookup systems), whether during or after the term of your domain name registration services of the domain name.\nYou hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action you may have arising from such disclosure or use of such information.\nAdditionally, you acknowledge that ICANN may establish or modify the guidelines, limits and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that we may or must make available to the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available.\nInformation regarding ICANN\u2019s guidelines and requirements regarding WHOIS can be found at http://www.icann.org/registrars/wmrp.htm, http://www.icann.org/registrars/wdrp.htm, and elsewhere on the ICANN website at http://www.icann.org/index.html.\nYou agree that we may make publicly available, or directly available to third parties, some, or all, of the information you provide, for purposes of inspection (such as through our WHOIS service) or for targeted marketing and other purposes as required or permitted by applicable laws.\nOne of the ways that we may make some or all of the information you provide available to the public or third parties is by way of bulk WHOIS data access provided to third parties who enter into a bulk WHOIS data access agreement with us.</p>AFTER EXPIRATION OF THE TERM OF A DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION:<p>Immediately after the expiration of the term of domain name registration services and before deletion of the domain name in the applicable registry\u2019s database, you acknowledge that we may direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) designated by us, including, without limitation, to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine that may display advertisements, and you acknowledge that we may either leave your WHOIS information intact or that we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.\nReactivation Period Process.\nFor a period of approximately 30 days after expiration of the term of domain name registration services, you acknowledge that we may provide a procedure by which expired domain name registration services may be renewed.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, offer this process, called the \u201creactivation period.\u201d You acknowledge that you assume all risks and all consequences if you wait until close to or after the expiration of the original term of domain name registration services to attempt to renew the domain name registration services.\nYou acknowledge that we, for any reason and in our sole discretion, may choose not to offer a reactivation period and that we shall not be liable therefore.\nYou acknowledge that reactivation period renewal processes, if any, may involve additional fees which we and your Primary Service Provider may determine.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we may make expired domain name services(s) available to third parties, that we may auction off the rights to expired domain name services (the auction beginning close to the end or after the end of the reactivation period), and/or that expired domain name registration services may be re-registered to any party at any time.\nAfter the reactivation period, you agree that we may either (i) discontinue the domain name registration services at any time thereafter, (ii) that we may pay the registry\u2019s registration fee or otherwise provide for the registration services to be continued, or, (iii) if we auctioned the domain name services to a third party, that we may transfer the domain name registration services to such third party.\nIn the case of (i), above, you acknowledge that certain registry administrators may provide procedures by which discontinued domain name registration services may nonetheless be renewed.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we may, but are not obligated to, participate in this process, typically called the \u201cRedemption Grace Period\u201d (\u201cRGP\u201d).\nYou acknowledge that we, for any reason and in our sole discretion, may choose not to participate in the RGP process with respect to any or all of your domain name registration services and that we shall not be liable therefore.\nIf available, RGP typically ends between 30 and 42 days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services, as the reactivation period applied to you.\nThe typical RGP fee is $160 plus any registration fees.\nYou agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being discontinued.\nIn the case of (ii), above, you acknowledge that we may then set the name-servers and the DNS settings for the domain name services, that we set the DNS to point to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host parking page(s) or a commercial search engine that may display paid advertisements, and you acknowledge that we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.\nYou acknowledge that we do not have to pay you any of the proceeds, if any, we may earn as a result.\nYou agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are being continued.\nIn this case, the domain name will be designated as being in the extended redemption grace period (\u201cERGP\u201d), and you will be allowed to assume, during the first 120 days of the then extant registration term, complete management of the domain name services, including the right to control the DNS settings, provided that you pay a fee of $160 (US dollars) plus any registration fees.\nAfter the end of the 120-day period, if you do not exercise your rights under this provision, you agree that you have abandoned the domain name services, and relinquish all rights and use of the domain name services.\nIn the case of (iii), above, the third party who won the auction for the domain name services will control the domain name services, including control over the WHOIS information and the DNS settings.\nYou may recover the domain name registration services for a period of up to 42 days after the end of the reactivation period, as such reactivation period applied to you.\nYou agree that we are not obliged to contact you to alert you that the domain name registration services are or were auctioned.\nYou acknowledge that we do not have to pay you any of the proceeds, if any, we may earn as a result of such an auction.\nTo exercise your rights to recover auctioned domain name services, you must contact us and provide us with a certified letter addressed to \u201cExpiration Recovery\u201d and including documents setting forth your identity and address, which identity and address must be the same as that of the registrant as it was listed in the WHOIS information for the domain name services prior to expiration, a copy of a commonly accepted (in the United States) picture ID (such as a drivers license or passport) which supports your identity and address claim, a front and back photocopy of your credit card and you must a statement authorizing payment of the reinstatement fee to such credit card, which is $160 plus any registration fees.\nIn doing so, you must provide us with sufficient time to allow us to receive and evaluate your documents and to contact the auction winner prior to the end of 30 days after the end of the reactivation period of the domain name services.</p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:<p>YOU AGREE THAT WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (1) SUSPENSION OR LOSS OF THE SERVICE(S), INCLUDING,
