controlled by third parties in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (pdf).\nThe address of Company's Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (\"Designated Agent\") is listed at the end of this policy.</p>\n<p>It is Company's policy to (1) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be the intellectual property of a third party (e.g., copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, etc.) that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users.\nand (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.\nA repeat infringer is a user for whom Bandcamp has received more than two notices of claimed infringement or for which Bandcamp has had to remove content more than twice.\nNotwithstanding the preceding sentence, Bandcamp reserves the right to immediately terminate the account of any user for egregious infringing activities in Bandcamp's sole determination and discretion.</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement: <p>If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Company Web site or service infringes an intellectual property right that you own or control, please send a notice of claimed infringement containing the following information and <em>only</em> the following information to the Designated Agent listed below.\nPlease note that you will be liable for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, if you materially misrepresent that content or an activity is infringing your copyrights.\nYour communication must include all of the following items:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work that has been allegedly infringed;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Identification of works or materials being infringed;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the intellectual property owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Company is capable of finding and verifying its existence.\n<strong>Providing URLs in the body of an email is the best way to help us locate content quickly.</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If claiming <strong>copyright infringement,</strong> the statement \"I swear under penalty of perjury that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed, and that the information in this notification is accurate.\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\"</p>\n<p>If claiming <strong>trademark infringement,</strong> the statement \"I swear under penalty of perjury that I am the trademark owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed, and that the information in this notification is accurate.\nI have a good faith belief that use of the materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law.\"</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that a copy of your legal notice will be forwarded to the party responsible for providing the alleged infringing content.</p>\n<p>Please do not include <em>any</em> information in your report other than the above items.\nThe wonderful thing about the DMCA is that it makes the sordid details of your bass player's departure completely irrelevant.\nSimply include the information above and we'll have all the information we need.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent: <p>It is Company's policy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>to remove or disable access to the infringing material;</li>\n<li>to notify the content provider, member or user that it has removed or disabled access to the material.\nand</li>\n<li>that repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that Company will terminate such content provider's, member's or user's access to the service.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent: <p>If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the owner of the intellectual property, the owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access to has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>\n<li>A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material.\nand</li>\n<li>Content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or if the content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days.\nUnless the owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company's discretion.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please contact Company's Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement at the following

We recognize that the following document is the literary equivalent of 20 milligrams of Ambien, but it really and truly is required that you read and agree to it before using Bandcamp.\nWe've done our best to make it all go down smooth \u2013 you won't find any 8-point type, or long sections of TOTALLY UNREADABLE ALL-CAPS intended to fulfill the legal definition of \"conspicuous\" (we're pretty sure Your Honor will accept yellow, bold text instead).\nStill, what follows is plenty involved, so we thought we'd kick things off by answering the top three things a visitor to this page might be wondering:</p> For artists:\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Am I signing over the rights to my music, home and firstborn?</strong> No.\nThe only rights we take are the obvious ones we need to run the service.\nFor example, the right to host the music you upload, stream and sell it on your behalf, display whatever lyrics and artwork you put on the site, and so on.\nThe full details are here.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>What can I upload? Are covers OK?</strong> You must own or control all rights to everything you upload.\nThat means covers are out, unless you have a written license or authorization from the artist to upload the cover to Bandcamp and grant us the rights in the terms below.\nDo not upload cover songs unless you have obtained all permissions and authorizations in writing! These requirements apply regardless of whether you're selling the music or giving it away.\nThe full details are here.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How much does Bandcamp cost?</strong> Please see our pricing page, and the fees section below.</li>\n</ol> For fans:\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Is my personal information going to be re-sold to some random third-party advertiser?</strong> No, we only use personal information for the purposes of improving Bandcamp and our users experience on Bandcamp.\nIn addition to our limited use, the artists you support or follow will have access to your personal information in certain cases.\nPlease see our privacy policy for the full details.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>When I buy something on Bandcamp, is the artist I\u2019m trying to support receiving just a fraction of a fraction of what I pay?</strong> No, Bandcamp only makes money when artists make a lot more money, and we like to keep our interests aligned with the artists we serve.\nIn general, artists receive 80-85% of every dollar a fan spends.\nYou can find out more by reading our Fair Trade Music Policy here and the fees section below.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>OK, on to the legally binding portion!</p>\n<p>Please read these Terms of Use (\"Agreement\" or \"Terms of Use\") carefully before using the services offered by Bandcamp, Inc.\n(\"Company,\" \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or

with information that you choose to share about yourself, and the ability to follow other fans or Artists .\nFollowing an Artist or purchasing a subscription to an Artist (an \u201cArtist

physical merchandise (\u201cMerchandise\u201d) and Artist Subscriptions.\nEach such purchase is a \u201cTransaction,\u201d each Transaction involving Digital Content is a \u201cDigital Transaction,\u201d, and each Transaction involving Merchandise is a \u201cMerchandise Transaction.\u201d Transactions may be made using Standard Payments or Enhanced Payments, which are detailed here.</p> Fees and Payments \u2013 Fans.\n<p>You may purchase products and/or services from an Artist through the Site, including, without limitation, purchases of Content including Digital Content, Merchandise, and Artist Subscriptions.</p>\n<p>All inquiries regarding Merchandise Transactions will be directed to the relevant Artist.\nCompany is not responsible for refunds for Merchandise, except as provided in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>All sales of Digital Content are final (except where prohibited by law), unless otherwise determined by Bandcamp.\nIf you do not receive the Digital Content or otherwise have an issue with the Digital Content delivered, please contact Bandcamp with your request and proof of payment, and we will notify the relevant Artist and work with them to resolve your issue.\nAt Bandcamp\u2019s sole discretion, you may be credited or refunded for the Digital Content.\nHowever, you understand and agree that Bandcamp is a platform that Artists use to sell their products, and the Digital Content is derived from files provided by the relevant Artist, and the relevant Artist is solely responsible for such files.</p>\n<p>Your total price for Digital Content will include the price of the product plus any applicable sales tax.\nsuch sales tax is based on your location and the sales tax rate in effect at the time you purchase the product.\nWe will charge tax only in states or countries where digital goods are taxable.</p>\n<p>If you purchase an Artist Subscription, your payment for such Artist Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Artist Subscription before the end of the current subscription period.\nThe cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period.</p>\n<p>Content you purchase in a Transaction cannot be guaranteed to be available to you perpetually.\nFor example, if we receive a notification of claimed infringement from a copyright owner or its agent with respect to specific Content, then U.S.\nlaw may require us to remove that Content from the Service and not make it available for future sale and we may also have to deny continued access to anyone who previously purchased such Content.\nThis means that you may lose access to purchased Content previously available to you through the Service.</p>\n<p>If we are required by law to deny access through the Service to previously purchased Content, including by removing access to Content from a user\u2019s personal collection through any mobile application, then Company and Artists will not provide the user who purchased that Content with a refund, except as required by applicable law.\nUsers bear all risk from the denial of access to any Content purchased through the Service.</p>\n<p>Because there is a possibility that we may be required to deny you access to previously purchased Content, we encourage you to promptly download any Content you purchase through the Site to your own devices so that you will retain control and possession of such Content even if we are required to remove the Content from the Service.</p>\n<p>You warrant that if you enter into a Transaction, then you shall be able to make full and immediate payment for the requested products or services.</p> Fees and Payments \u2013 Artists.\n<p>You will set the prices for your products and services that are charged through Transactions (the \u201cPrices\u201d) through the Site, and you may change the Prices at your sole discretion.\nNotwithstanding the preceding sentence, Bandcamp may redistribute previously purchased copies of your products to users who have, in Bandcamp\u2019s sole determination, received a corrupted copy of your product, an incorrect file format version of your product, an incomplete copy of your product, or suffered a loss of your product through hard drive failure, damage, theft or destruction, on a no-fee basis to the user (i.e., the user is not charged a new fee for the redistribution).\nSuch redistribution may be effectuated by allowing a user to redownload a replacement copy themselves.\nA user that has a Fan Account will also be permitted to redownload any previously purchased Content from an Artist.\nIn the event of any of the foregoing redistributions, no additional payments shall be made to you for such redistributions.</p>\n<p>Company shall be entitled to a share of the revenue you receive from Transactions (the \u201cRevenue Share\u201d), which shall be calculated on your gross revenue from Transactions, not including any Transactions for which you or we provide a refund, in accordance with the rate schedule set forth at www.bandcamp.com/pricing.\nYou shall be solely responsible and liable for, and Company shall have no responsibility or liability for, any Stripe fees (except for fees charged on Company\u2019s Stripe account), PayPal fees (except for fees charged on Company\u2019s PayPal account), credit card transaction fees (together, \u201cFees\u201d), bad debts (such as credit card returns or fraud), disputed payments, and refunds, except as provided in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>Bandcamp may withhold any taxes, duties, charges or levies on payments by Bandcamp to you pursuant to this Agreement as may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation.\nBandcamp shall remit any such withheld taxes, duties, charges or levies to the appropriate tax authority.</p>\n<p>For Merchandise Transactions using Standard Payments, payments received from users for Merchandise shall be directed to you, unless there is an outstanding Revenue Share owed to Company in which case such payments may be directed to Company in accordance with Company\u2019s standard policies.\nBandcamp may retain funds otherwise payable to you if Bandcamp is required or chooses to provide a refund on your behalf.</p>\n<p>For Digital Content and Merchandise Transactions using Enhanced Payments, Bandcamp will collect the purchase price and any applicable Fees and taxes.\nBandcamp will pay you the gross proceeds we receive from the sale of Digital Content, minus the applicable Revenue Share and any applicable Fees (the \u201cArtist Payout\u201d).</p>\n<p>For Artist Subscriptions, payments received from users shall be directed to you (the \u201cSubscription Fee\u201d), minus the applicable Revenue Share and any applicable fees which shall be directed to Bandcamp at the time of each payment.</p>\n<p>When you receive a payment for Digital Content or Artist Subscription, you are liable to Bandcamp for the full amount of the payment sent to you plus any Fees if the payment is later invalidated for any reason.\nThis means that, in addition to any other liability, you will be responsible for the amount of the payment sent by the sender, plus the applicable Fees if there is a chargeback, a dispute, or if there is a reversal of the payment.\nYou agree to allow Bandcamp to recover any amounts due to Bandcamp by debiting your account or withholding any Artist Payout or Subscription Fee.\nIf there are insufficient funds to cover your liability, you agree to reimburse Bandcamp through other means.</p>\n<p>Company retains the right, but does not have the obligation, to immediately halt the offering or sale of any goods or services, prevent or restrict access to the Site or the Services or take any other action in case of technical problems, objectionable material, inaccurate listings, or actions otherwise prohibited by the procedures and guidelines contained on the Site, or for any other reason in the sole and absolute discretion of Company, and to correct any inaccurate listing or technical problems on the Site.\nCompany may immediately halt the offering or sale of any goods or services upon receipt of notifications of claimed infringement, upon acquiring knowledge of actual infringement, or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which infringing material is apparent with respect to any goods or services.</p> Additional Fees.\n<p>In addition to the fees set forth above, Company reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain additional features of the Service, including but not limited to Bandcamp Pro or Label accounts.\nShould you elect to subscribe to such features, you shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the Site in connection with such features.\nCompany reserves the right to change its price list and to institute new charges at any time, upon ten (10) days prior notice to you, which may be sent by e-mail or posted on the Site.\nUse of the Service by you following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges.</p> Bandcamp Pro and Label Account Cancellation and Termination of Payments.\n<p>If you sign up for Bandcamp Pro or a Label account, you can cancel your subscription at any time by going to the relevant section of your profile page and clicking \u201ccancel Pro subscription\u201d or \u201ccancel Label subscription\u201d, as applicable.\nOnce you cancel, your Bandcamp Pro or Label account services will continue for the duration of the monthly billing cycle for which you have already paid.\nWe do not issue partial refunds for unused time in a monthly billing cycle for which you have already paid, but you will not be charged for any following monthly billing cycles.\nFor more information, see https://bandcamp.com/help/pro and https://bandcamp.com/help/labels.</p> Third Party Site.\n<p>The Service may permit you to link to other websites or resources on the Internet, and other websites or resources may contain links to the Site.\nWhen you access third party websites, you do so at your own risk.\nThese other websites are not under Company's control, and you acknowledge that Company is not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such websites or resources.\nThe inclusion of any such link does not imply endorsement by Company or any association with its operators.\nYou further acknowledge and agree that Company shall not be

or through any such website or resource.</p> Content and License.\n<p>You agree that the Service contains Content specifically provided by Company or its partners and that such Content is protected by

reproduce the Content, solely for personal, non-commercial use.\nUse, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any Content for other than personal, non-commercial use is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from Company, or from the copyright holder identified in such Content's copyright notice.\nYou shall not sell, license, rent, or otherwise use or exploit any Content for commercial use or in any way that violates any third party right.</p> Intellectual Property Rights \u2013 Artists.\n<p>The Service provides Artists with the ability to upload Digital Content owned or controlled by such Artists to the Site, including but not limited to sound recordings (\u201cSound Recordings\u201d), videos synchronized with Sound Recordings and other audiovisual
