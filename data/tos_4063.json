\u201cJimdo\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) via this Privacy Policy wish to hereby inform Jimdo users and visitors of our websites as to the purpose, type and extent of the processing of personal information.\nThe responsible body for this data processing within the meaning of the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) is the Jimdo GmbH, Stresemannstrasse 375, 22761 Hamburg, Germany (privacy@jimdo.com).</p>\n<p>Our websites and services are constantly being revised and improved.\nCorresponding thereto, this Privacy Policy shall regularly be revised and updated.\nThis applies in particular to those procedures used by us to carry out usage analysis, as well as those used to measure the effectiveness of advertising methods and comparable services, in particular those belonging to third parties.\nThe current status of each of these services can be found in the tabulation located at the end of this Privacy Policy statement.</p>\n<p>We would also like to note the following as regards to the usage of service providers located outside of the European Union: Jimdo is a service that is offered internationally.\nThus, it extends not only beyond the federal republic of Germany, but also beyond the European Union.\nWe operate worldwide and our users are scattered across this planet.\nGenerally we give priority to European service providers when selecting particular services and service offerings, especially where such providers can deliver the required services at a comparable and competitive price and service level.\nHowever, we also wish to be completely transparent.\nFor many of the services that we use there is simply no comparable, acceptable alternative.\nAs a result we therefore employ the use of a range of service providers outside the European Union, in particular from the USA.\nWe take steps to ensure that measures according to European Data Protection law are taken and applied so as to guarantee an adequate level of data protection.</p>Usage of Personal Data<p>We collect, process and use personal data (in accordance with the definitions of the German Federal Data Processing Law) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in order to provide our services.\nThe promotion of our products and provision of information as regards product functions etc.\nto Jimdo Users as well as other interested parties is a natural component thereof.\nThe scope of the processing of the personal data concerned depends on whether our websites are merely being visited or alternatively being used by a Jimdo User or more specifically if a registration as a user takes place.</p>Children\u2019s Privacy<p>Our websites are generally accessible websites and not intended for children.\nWe do not knowingly collect personal information from users who are considered to be children under their respective national laws.</p>The processing of personal dataThe Purposes of Processing by Jimdo<p>Jimdo uses the personal data of the Jimdo user to perform and implement the contract with the Jimdo user and to provide our services (Art.\n6 (1) (b) GDPR) in order to comply with our legal obligations (Art.\n6 (1) (c) GDPR) or to protect the vital interests of the Jimdo user (Art.\n6 (1) (d) GDPR).</p>\n<p>This includes the following cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to ensure access to and use of our services (including billing), in particular publishing adverts and other content of the user, to measure and improve the quality and success of our services, to safeguard our services and ensure they are operational, and to adapt the services and the content of the website to what the Jimdo user might like on the basis of actions taken by them;</li>\n<li>to contact the Jimdo user regarding their account by email, fax or live chat, to deal with problems with the account, to resolve disputes, to enforce the collection of fees, or to provide other necessary customer services;</li>\n<li>to detect, prevent and investigate fraud, security breaches and other potential prohibited or illegal activities;</li>\n<li>to enforce our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy or other policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We only use the personal data of the Jimdo user in pursuit of our legitimate interests, provided these interests are not overridden by the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the Jimdo user (Art.\n6 (1) (f) GDPR).\nWe have introduced control mechanisms in order to balance our interests with the rights of the Jimdo user.\nOn the basis of these principles, we use the data as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to improve our services, for example by reviewing information related to blocked or crashed pages so we can identify and fix problems and provide a better user experience;</li>\n<li>to monitor and improve the information security of our services;</li>\n<li>for advertising/marketing purposes \u2013 the legal basis for this is Art.\n13 (2) of EU Directive 2002/58/EC.\nOur interests in addressing needs-based advertising is considered legitimate within the meaning of the aforementioned provision:<ul>\n<li>to personalize, measure and improve our advertising based on what the Jimdo user might potentially like;</li>\n<li>for the purposes of direct marketing to contact the Jimdo user within the scope of the applicable law by email or post in order to offer coupons, discounts and special offers, to ask their opinion by sending surveys or questionnaires, and to inform the Jimdo user about our services;</li>\n<li>to provide the Jimdo user with targeted marketing, service updates and promotions that they might potentially like;</li>\n<li>to verify the quality and success of our email marketing campaigns (for example by analyzing opening and click rates).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the consent of the Jimdo user (Art.\n6 (1) (a) GDPR) we may use their personal data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to provide advertising by email;</li>\n<li>to provide

Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick.\nIn this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to the particular user based on their previous usage and browsing behavior on one terminal (e.g., cell phone) may also be displayed on another user's terminal (e.g., tablet or PC).</p>\n<p>Once the user has given their consent, Google links the web and app browsing history

when they set up an account:\n<em>You will also receive regular newsletters about Jimdo\u2019s products, services and promotions, where opening and click rates will be monitored in order to optimize the content.\nYou can unsubscribe at any time.\nMore information about data processing can be found here.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Our newsletter is sent via the service provider \u201cBraze Inc\u201d, a newsletter sending platform from the US operator Braze, Inc., 318 West 39th Street, 5th Floor, New York, New York 10018, USA.\nJimdo has entered into a Data Processing Agreement with Braze as per Art.\n28 GDPR which includes EU standard contractual clauses.\n</p>\n<p>Braze\u2019s Privacy Policy can be found here: https://www.braze.com/company/legal/privacy#part_three</p>\n<p>The legal basis for using Braze\u2019s services is Art.\n6 (1) (f) GDPR \u2013 legitimate interest.\nOur legitimate interest in using this service is optimizing our marketing measures.\nBraze may use the data of the recipient in aggregated format, i.e.\nwithout reference to a user, in order to optimize or improve its own services, such as technically optimizing the sending and the display of the newsletter or for statistical purposes, for example.</p>Measuring Success via Opening and Click Rates:<p>We may use individual functionalities (such as using behavioral data) of our newsletter to trace which content of our newsletter is particularly interesting to the Jimdo user.\nWe will only use the results of these analyses for the purposes of improving our services and designing our services to better meet your requirements as well as for targeting purposes.\nThe newsletter therefore contains a so-called \u201cweb beacon\u201d, which is a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server, or if we use Braze or Litmus, from their server when the newsletter is opened.\nTechnical information, such as browser and system information, as well as IP address and the time of the retrieval is collected as part of this process.\nThis information is used to improve the technical performance of our services using the technical data, or the target groups and reading behavior based on the access location (which can be determined using the IP address), or the time of access.\nStatistical data that is also collected includes determining whether the newsletter has been opened, when it was opened, how long it was opened for and which links were clicked on.\nFor technical reasons, it may be possible to assign this information to individual newsletter recipients.\nHowever, it is not our goal, or that of the newsletter service provider if used by us, to monitor individual users.\nThese analyses rather serve to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to our users, or to send them different content in accordance with their interests.</p>Unsubscribing, Withdrawing Newsletter Consent:<p>The Jimdo user may object to or withdraw their consent for the storage and usage of their data for sending the newsletter at any time with future effect without needing to give reasons, without being penalized in any way, and without paying any cost for this other than the transmission costs for sending the objection/withdrawal.\nThis can be done by clicking the unsubscribe link in the newsletter, which can be found at the end of every newsletter.\nAlternatively, Jimdo users can deselect the \u201cNewsletter\u201d box in their customer account.</p>\n<p>Your consent to statistical analysis will also be withdrawn at the same time.\nIt is unfortunately not possible to only object to the statistical analysis in our newsletter, this can only take place when completely unsubscribing from the newsletter.\nThe legality of the data-processing operations are unaffected by the withdrawal of your consent.\nIn the event that you withdraw your consent, the personal data used for this data processing will be anonymized or erased.\nData that has been stored by us for other purposes (such as e-mail addresses for the member area) are not affected by this.</p>Jimdo Blog 8 DaysStatistics<p>The Jimdo 8 Days blog site uses the web analytics service Jetpack (formerly WordPress.com Stats) operated by Automattic Inc., 60 29th Street # 343, San Francisco, CA 94110-4929, USA, using Quantcast Inc.'s tracking technology.\n201 3rd St, Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94103-3153, USA.\nWith the help of Jetpack, based on our legitimate interest in the statistical analysis of user behavior for optimization and marketing purposes pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR pseudonymised visitor data is collected, evaluated and stored.\nFrom this data, pseudonymised usage profiles can be created and evaluated for the same purpose.\nJetpack uses so-called cookies.</p>\n<p>The information generated by the cookie about the use of this website (including the pseudonymous IP address) are transmitted to a server in the United States and stored there to safeguard the above interests.\nIn order to counter data collection and storage of visitor data for the future, an opt-out cookie can be obtained from Quantcast under the following link, which will prevent future visitor data from the Jimdo user\u2019s browser from being collected and stored at Jetpack: https://www.quantcast.com/opt-out/ The opt-out cookie is set by Quantcast.</p>Hosting of the Jimdo Blog Page<p>Jimdo (or more specifically the web space provider for the Jimdo Blog website, WP Engine) collects data about every access to the blog pages (so-called server log files).\nAccess data includes:</p>\n<p>Name of the retrieved web page, file, date and time of retrieval, amount of data transferred, notification of successful retrieval, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.</p>\n<p>The provider uses the log data for statistical evaluations only with the purpose being the operation, security and optimization of the Blog page.\nHowever, the provider reserves the right to subsequently review the log data if, on the basis of concrete evidence, the legitimate suspicion of unlawful use exists.\nThe privacy policy of WP-Engine can be viewed here.</p>Blog CommentsDISQUS comment management<p>Based on our legitimate interests in an efficient, secure and user-friendly commentary system for our blog pages we use the comment management service DISQUS.</p>\n<p>In order to use the DISQUS features, users can log in using their own DISQUS user account or existing social media accounts (e.g., OpenID, Facebook, Twitter, or Google).\nHere, the user credentials are obtained from the platforms through DISQUS.\nIt is also possible to use the DISQUS comment feature as a guest without creating or using user accounts with DISQUS or any of the social media providers listed.</p>\n<p>Jimdo embeds DISQUS with its features on our Jimdo Blog, \u201c8 days\u201d.\nHowever, users enter into a direct contractual relationship with DISQUS, in which DISQUS processes users' comments and acts as point of contact for any deletion of users' data.\nPlease refer to the DISQUS privacy policy: https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy in which DISQUS informs users that they save the comment content, as well as store the IP address of the commenter and the timestamp of submission.\nDisqus also saves cookies on users' computers and may use them to display advertising.\nHowever, users may object to the processing of their data to display ads:</p>\n<p>Jimdo reserves the right to delete comments if their content violates the Jimdo Terms of Service.\nIn addition, we reserve the right to stop or remove the comment function and the associated comments on any article, at any time.</p>Access and Publicly Available InformationThe Jimdo Website:<p>All information posted on the Jimdo website of a Jimdo user may, in principle, be accessed by other Internet users e.g.\nwhen it is published by the Jimdo user on the Jimdo user\u2019s website.\nTherefore, the publication of personal information (eg addresses, telephone numbers) and sensitive data (e.g.\npasswords, access data) should be handled carefully and prudently.\nHidden subpages and password-protected areas do not provide absolute protection against unauthorized access.\nThe same applies to uploaded files, as these may be accessible via direct links.</p>Administrative Access to your Jimdo Website:<p>As part of our customer service and error tracing, our employees also have access to the administrative area of Jimdo Websites (CMS) on an ad hoc basis.\nAdministrative access is to be understood as insight into all areas of the corresponding Jimdo website, including the password-protected areas.\nAll our employees are regularly trained in data protection and are under an obligation to maintain confidentiality.</p>Encryption<p>For the encryption (HTTPS over TLS) of Jimdo websites of the Jimdo user we use the free service \"Let's Encrypt\".\nThrough the certificates, we can offer a so-called transport encryption, which protects the communication to a Jimdo website from access by unauthorized third parties.</p>Rights of the Data Subjects<p>(i.e.\nJimdo user or Jimdo Site Visitor, hereinafter referred to collectively as \u201cJimdo user\u201d)</p>\n<p>According to the relevant legislation, including the GDPR, the Jimdo user and site visitors have certain rights in relation to their personal data that is processed by Jimdo.\nIn particular, they have a right to information, correction, transferability or deletion of their data.\nThe Jimdo user also has the right to object to certain processing of their data.</p>\n<p>In some cases, it will not be possible to change or remove content after it has been published on the Jimdo website.\nUpon receipt of such request, Jimdo may close the corresponding Jimdo Account and remove the offending personal information from public areas as soon as possible based on account activity and applicable law.\nThe legal right to information, correction or deletion of personal data remains unaffected.</p>Information and Access<p>The Jimdo user can usually access, verify and edit their personal information in their Jimdo account by logging in and directly updating or deleting the appropriate information.</p>\n<p>We are happy to inform you, which personal data we have stored on you, as well as any fees incurred under applicable law.\nThe information will be processed by us immediately and is usually sent via email.\nIn order to receive detailed information, please inform us as far as possible as to the type of personal data requested.\nTo be sure that the requesting person is also the person whom they claim to be, we require proof of identity.\nThis can be a copy of an official identity document.\nPlease ensure that serial numbers, passport numbers or similar are blackened out or removed.\nWe use this copy solely for identification and processing of the request and delete it as soon as it has served its purpose.</p>Right to Object<p>Insofar as the Jimdo user\u2019s or site visitor\u2019s data is collected on the basis of Jimdo\u2019s legitimate interests (Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, the Jimdo user/site visitor may object to the future processing of their data in accordance with Article 21 GDPR at any time, for the future.\nThe objection may in particular be expressed against processing for direct marketing purposes (via sending an email to privacy@jimdo.com or unsubscribing directly from such communications via the unsubscribe link in every mail).\nA corresponding note as regards the Jimdo Newsletter unsubscription process can be found in every newsletter email.</p>\n<p>If the Jimdo user makes use of his right to object, Jimdo will stop the processing of the data concerned.\nHowever, further processing is reserved if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate reasons for the processing that outweighs the interests of the Jimdo user, their fundamental rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.\nIf Jimdo is asked to cease all or any part of the processing of the personal information, or if the Jimdo user revokes his consent (if any) to the use or disclosure of their personal information for purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, Jimdo may cease to be able to provide all Jimdo services to the Jimdo user.</p>\n<p>The Jimdo user also has the right to object to the processing personal data that is used for statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89 (1) GDPR for reasons that arise from their particular situation via a simple email to that effect sent to privacy@jimdo.com.</p>Right to Data Portability<p>In certain cases, which are listed in detail in Art.\n20 GDPR, the site visitor or the Jimdo user has the right to receive personal data concerning him or her, in a structured, common and machine-readable format or to have this data transferred to a third party upon demand.</p>Exercising your Rights<p>In order to exercise these and other data subject right,, an affected party may, at any time, contact Jimdo via the following contact address privacy@jimdo.com.</p>\n<p>Where the Jimdo User exercises his or her legal right to access, correction or deletion of their personal information, Jimdo may, under certain circumstances in particular where legally obliged to so, refuse to provide such information or refuse to correct or delete your personal information.\nHowever, Jimdo will give the reasons in these cases.</p>Right to Lodge a Complaint<p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, the Jimdo user has the right to lodge a complaint with a relevant supervisory authority in accordance with Article 77 GDPR, in particular in the Member State of the user\u2019s place of residence, place of work or place of alleged infringement, if the Jimdo user is of the opinion that the processing of his personal data has not occurred in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.</p>Data Security<p>The Jimdo User's information is protected by the Jimdo technical and organizational security measures to minimize risks associated with their loss, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure and alteration of their and all users data.\nFor example, we use firewalls and data encryption, as well as physical access restrictions for our data centers and data access authorization controls.</p>Changes to this Privacy Policy<p>Jimdo reserves the right to change this privacy policy should this be necessary due to a change in legislation or as a result of further or changed services used or offered by Jimdo.\nThe current version can always be located on this page.\nIf Jimdo intends to process the data of the Jimdo user for purposes other than those for which they were collected, we will inform the Jimdo user in advance, in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p>In the event of any deviations resulting from the translation, the formulation set forth in the German version shall prevail.</p>Contact<p>If any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy arise, we can be contacted via this form, via email or via a letter to:</p>\n<p>Jimdo

loans in a commercial manner without demonstrable permission from a relevant authority.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3</strong> Furthermore, every action that could influence the normal functioning of the Jimdo platform is prohibited.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.4</strong> In the event of claims (e.g.\nsecondary liability, third party liability etc.) due to illegal content which the User has placed on a Jimdo site, the User agrees to indemnify Jimdo and hold Jimdo harmless from any claim or demand (including and not limited to cease and desist orders with contractual fines, revocations, damages, rectifications etc.).\nIn such a case the user is also under the obligation to assist Jimdo in every manner in responding to and in the defense of such claims.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5</strong> The sending of emails to various recipients (newsletter, promotional emails) via the Jimdo mail system is prohibited.\nBy the term \u201cvarious\u201d we refer to the explanation established by our email provider Backspace based on the CAN_SPAM Act: the sending of an email to more than 200 persons.\nThe email systems we use react automatically to the sending of this type of email and block access to the relevant email account and the email administration of the Jimdo website.\nIn the event of repeated violations, we shall reserve the right to permanently block email access.</p>7.\nDomain (Name) Registration, Domain Name Cancellation, and Change of Provider<p>\n<strong>7.1</strong> Some of the fee-based service packages (hereinafter referred to as \"fee-based Packages\" or \"Premium Packages\") include the provision of one or more domain names.\nAs regards the acquisition and maintenance of domains, Jimdo serves only as an agent between the Jimdo user and the organization responsible for domain name allocation (registrar) concerned.\nTop-level domains (e.g.\n.COM, .US) are predominantly managed by a large number of different organizations, mostly at the national level.\nEach of these organizations has its own terms and conditions pertaining to the registration and management of domain names.\nThe registration terms and conditions of the relevant domain registrar will therefore apply complementarily to these terms and conditions.\ne.g.\nin the case of DE domain names the registration terms and conditions of the DENIC e.G.\n(Registered Cooperative) shall apply.\nAccordingly the applicable registrar's terms and conditions thus form part of this contract.\nOn request the Service Provider will send a copy of such terms and conditions to the Jimdo user.\nAlternatively they may be accessed online from the respective allocating organization.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.2</strong> The Jimdo user is in particular responsible for providing correct and complete data regarding the domain name holder (registrant) and the administrative contact (admin-C) when registering the domain name.\nThe technical contact in all cases will be Jimdo GmbH.\nIrrespective of the relevant registration terms and conditions, such data must include the name of the domain name holder, and physical mailing address (PO boxes or anonymous addresses are not permissible), a valid email address and telephone number.\nIf this information changes, the Jimdo user must immediately inform Jimdo of this change via the online (in the admin/menu) Domain Change Ownership form.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.3</strong> Upon formation of the contract, Jimdo will make the option available to register the desired domain name with the responsible registrar.\nJimdo may defer activation of a domain name until payment of the agreed fees for the registration services has been received.\nJimdo has no influence on the allocation of the domain name by the relevant organization.\nTherefore Jimdo assumes no responsibility or liability that the requested domain names shall be allocated to the Jimdo user and/or that allocated domain names are free of third-party rights nor does jimdo guarantee their continued existence.\nAny information provided by Jimdo regarding the availability of a domain name is based on the data provided by third parties and only refers to the information available at the time that information is requested.\nThe domain shall only be deemed as being allocated to the Jimdo user upon successful registration of the domain by the user and its subsequent entry into the database of the registrar.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.4</strong> Before applying for a domain name, the Jimdo user will check that the domain name does not violate the rights of any third party or contravene existing legislation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.5</strong> A free change of the requested domain name after registration with the relevant registrar is excluded.\nIndependent thereof a further domain (for which a charge is incurred) can be registered and connected to the site.\nShould a domain name that has been applied for already have been allocated during the time required for forwarding the domain name request to the registrar, then the Jimdo user shall be entitled to choose a different, available domain name.\nWhere individual domains are cancelled by the user or are cancelled as a result of binding decisions resulting from domain name disputes, the Jimdo user shall not be entitled to a free of charge, substitute domain name.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.6</strong> Subject to these terms and conditions and those of the relevant registrar, the Jimdo user may transfer all domain names registered through Jimdo to another provider, provided that the new provider offers the corresponding top-level domain name (e.g.\n.COM, .DE) and supports the change given the required circumstances and technical requirements.\nIf the user is a consumer then the transfer is only possible outside of the legal revocation period for such \u201cdistance sales contracts\u201d.\nThe fee-based package e.g.\nJimdoPro- / JimdoBusiness- contract with Jimdo will remain unaffected by a change in provider.\nIn order to end this contractual relationship with Jimdo a specific cancellation is required.\nAll such declarations, in particular domain cancellation, domain deletion and change of provider must be submitted in text form or insofar as it is technically possible in the jimdo user\u2019s administration area (menu), the declaration can be executed electronically.\nIf Jimdo is unable to grant the provider change (domain transfer) on time due to tardiness in the initiation of the change of provider by the new provider or the Jimdo user, or where the necessary requirements in order to grant the change are not fulfilled, then Jimdo i.e.\nthe provider for the domain is expressly entitled to have the cancelled domain deleted to the cancellation date at the corresponding registrar ( \u201cCLOSE\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.7</strong> The Jimdo user is obligated to notify the Service Provider (Jimdo) immediately should he lose the rights to a domain name registered to him.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.8</strong> In the event of third parties credibly asserting rights to a domain name, Jimdo reserves the right to block the corresponding domain name until the dispute/issue has been resolved.\nIn the event of such a domain name blocking, the Jimdo user is still obligated to perform their side of the associated contract (i.e.\nto render payment).\nThe Jimdo user shall agree to all measures that have to be taken by jimdo in order to comply with court rulings and decisions.\nThe Jimdo user shall indemnify Jimdo from any third party claims, all resulting costs and negative consequences.</p>8.\nBlocking Access to your Account<p>\n<strong>8.1</strong> Jimdo reserves the right to block access to our services either temporarily or permanently if there are concrete indications that the Jimdo user has violated or shall violate these terms and conditions and/or the law, or if Jimdo has a legitimate interest in blocking access.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2</strong> Furthermore a blocking of the Jimdo access can occur if the user is more than 30 days in default on their payment.\nIn that case Jimdo is also entitled to apply for the deletion of the user's\u2019 domain name(s) at the respective registrar.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.3</strong> In deciding as to whether access shall be blocked, the legitimate interests of all parties shall be considered as appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.4</strong> In the event that the Jimdo user fails to log into their free of charge JimdoPage within 180 days, the Service Provider may delete the JimdoPage and its contents permanently and suspend all access to the Jimdo account by the User.</p>9.\nService Disruption<p>\n<strong>9.1</strong> Jimdo endeavors to ensure the best possible availability of the Jimdo services.\nThe Jimdo user acknowledges however, that for technical reasons as well as due to the Service Provider's dependence on external factors, (e.g.\nunavailability of telecommunications networks, electricity outages, hardware and/or software failure etc), the uninterrupted availability of individual Jimdo sites cannot be guaranteed.The Jimdo user can therefore not assert a claim for continual access to the Jimdo sites.\nAccess restrictions of a temporary nature shall not constitute grounds for warranty claims nor a right to extraordinary termination.\nThe current status of our systems can be be viewed under the following link: https://www.jimdo-status.com/</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.2</strong> In as far as the Jimdo services are provided free of charge, the user only has a claim to the use of the services within the framework of the actual availability provided.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.3</strong> As regards the fee based services provided by Jimdo, Jimdo guarantees within the sphere of our responsibility an availability of 98% throughout the year.\nRegular maintenance, which can amount to up to 4 hours per week is not included in the aforementioned, calculated availability.\nWe aim to keep the maintenance times as short as possible.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.4</strong> In order to ensure the proper operability of the Jimdo sites, a number of system requirements must be fulfilled.\nA list of these current requirements is available here.\nThe Service Provider is not liable for disruptions caused by the use of system configurations that vary from the list provided.</p>10.\nTerms of Payment<p>\n<strong>10.1</strong> For the use of the fee-based Packages as well as optional extra services/ services from third party providers charges shall apply that shall be due in advance for a complete contractual period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.2</strong> All payment methods possible shall be displayed to the user in the product information and/or during the checkout and ordering process.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.3</strong> Invoices for users of the Jimdo fee-based packages and services shall be provided to the user electronically, in pdf form.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.4</strong> The respective invoiced amount is due in full to Jimdo 14 days after the invoice has been deemed to have been received, unless otherwise agreed in text form.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.5</strong> The relevant day to determine the timeliness of payment is the day at which the amount is received by, or credited and completely available to Jimdo.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.6</strong> Jimdo processes all payments via external payment processors, including (but not limited to) Ingenico (Globalcollect), Paypal and Stripe.\nThe Jimdo user agrees that Jimdo payments shall only be accepted via these payment processors and that they correspondingly permit the processor concerned to charge the amount concerned.\nWhere bank transfers are concerned, this payment must be directed to the stated payment processor.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.7</strong> If the Jimdo contract includes a payment method for the automatic deduction of contract extension costs, Jimdo shall automatically deduct the invoice sum due on the day of contract extension subject to the corresponding consent of the Jimdo user.\nIf automatic deduction is not possible, the Jimdo user shall receive a payment link from us on the day of the contract extension.\nThe payment for the new contract extension must be transacted via this link within 14 days.\nBy selecting the payment method the Jimdo user consents to automatic deduction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.8</strong> Where payment is made via bank transfer the specific purpose \u201creason for payment\u201d supplied by Jimdo must be entered on the bank transfer.\nIf the Jimdo user sends a bank transfer with another purpose or the wrong purpose then they are obligated to inform Jimdo immediately and send Jimdo evidence of proof of payment.\nThis proof of payment must include the following details: The bank number concerned (IBAN of the sender), the name of the account holder, the payment date (Timezone), the amount, the purpose/reason for payment as entered on transfer form) as well as the bank number (recipient\u2019s IBAN).\nThe burden of proof as concerns payment lies solely with the Jimdo user.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.9</strong> Jimdo, the provider is also entitled to deactivate/block the user\u2019s website(s) and prevent their access where the charges due are not paid.\nIn this case Jimdo is also entitled to delete the corresponding domain names of the Jimdo user at the relevant registrar (\u201cCLOSE\u201d).\nIn accepting these terms of service, the Jimdo user grants Jimdo the explicit right to this type of termination.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.10</strong> Jimdo does not accept any liability for losses, damages or loss of revenue that may be caused by the blocking of a Jimdo Site due to incomplete or delayed payment, as long as the failure or delay can be attributed to the Jimdo user.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.11</strong> Payments are due in the respective national currency i.e.\nEURO or USD.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.12</strong> Discounts and other actions can only be applied to the first term of a contract, unless otherwise stipulated.\nThe current, applicable price shall apply to all contract renewals.\nWe may change our offer and prices from time to time.\nIn the event of such a change all existing, fee based contract holders shall be provided with a 6 week notice period and the changes shall take effect from the beginning of the next contractual period.\nIf the Jimdo user does not object to these changes within 6 weeks of the receipt of this change-notification and continues to use the Jimdo services subsequent to the expiration of the deadline, the changes announced in the notification shall be deemed to be effectively agreed to.\nIn the notification message we shall inform the user as to their right of objection, as well as the consequences of such an objection.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.13</strong> All prices include VAT.\nThe applicable VAT rate shall be shown on the invoice.\nIf the Jimdo user i.e.\nthe corresponding company is not based in Germany, but rather in the EU, the Jimdo user shall receive an invoice in which the VAT is not shown.\nIn that case the Jimdo user shall enter a (valid) VAT identification number with their Jimdo fee-based package order.\nIn that case the jimdo user is responsible for the taxation (reverse charge procedure).\nJimdo user outside of Europe as well as in Switzerland receive a net amount invoice.</p>11.\nChargebacks<p>\n<strong>11.1</strong> Should a payment be back-posted by the Jimdo user, we shall reserve the right to block the corresponding Jimdo page(s) and/or the relevant Jimdo account and to terminate the associated contract(s).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2</strong> Resumed use of the Jimdo website and/or the Jimdo account shall only be possible once all outstanding sums have been settled.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.3</strong> Charges that Jimdo incurs via a chargeback from a Jimdo user, denial of payment or via the opening of a dispute claim, may be invoiced to the user.\nShould the Jimdo user have questions regarding a payment they may contact the customer support teams in advance.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.4</strong> Should problems occur that prevent the collection/charging of the invoiced amount, Jimdo reserves the right to only offer certain payment methods for the payment of the invoice.</p>12.\nRight of Revocation<p>\n<strong>12.1</strong> Consumers are generally entitled to a right of revocation.\nFurther information can be found in our Cancellation Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.2</strong> In the event of a revocation of the contract by the Jimdo user, payments received from the user shall be returned without delay and at the latest within 14 days from the receipt of the revocation.\nWe will return your payment using the same payment method that you originally used to pay for your Jimdo package.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.3</strong> Once the cancellation is completed, Jimdo will delete all domains associated with the contract (unless they have already been moved to another provider) as well as any email account(s) associated with those domains (including the emails located in those email accounts).\nIn the course of the revocation/cancellation the Jimdo user has the option to deactivate the site or to continue to use it within the framework of another Jimdo service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.4</strong> If at the time of revocation the domain attached to the Jimdo site has already been registered or if the registration has already been submitted prior to submission of the revocation, Jimdo reserves the right to invoice the user for the cost of the domain registration or alternatively to reduce the refunded amount in accordance with the domain registration fee.</p>13.\nResponsibility for Content<p>\n<strong>13.1</strong> We offer the Jimdo user the possibility to post content on their Jimdo site and to make said content available to others via the Jimdo site.\nIn order for Jimdo to perform it\u2019s service and allow for the creation of a website with text, pictures and videos, it is necessary that the Jimdo user grants usage rights to Jimdo for the publication, editing and public broadcasting of this content.\nThis does not entitle Jimdo to sell the user content to a third party.\nThe copyright of the author shall remain unaffected.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.2</strong> With the posting of content the Jimdo user grants Jimdo gratuitous usage rights to the various content, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to store the content on the Jimdo servers as well as to publish and make such content publicly available (e.g.\nvia displaying said content on the Jimdo webpages)</li>\n<li>to edit and reproduce that data to the extent necessary for delivery and publication of the content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>13.3</strong> The Jimdo user is completely responsible for all content they post.\nJimdo is not obliged to inspect the content prior to publication as regards completeness, validity, legality, currentness, quality and suitability for particular purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.4</strong> The Jimdo user declares and guarantees Jimdo that they are the sole owner of all rights to the content posted by them on their Jimdo website, or that they are otherwise legitimately authorised to do so (e.g.\nvia written consent from the copyright holder).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.5</strong> Jimdo reserves the right to refuse, block or remove the posting of content and/or content that has already been posted (including private messages) without prior notice, should the posting of the content or the posted content itself constitute or lead to a violation of these terms and conditions, or where there is clear evidence that a serious violation of these terms shall result.\nThe legitimate interests of the Jimdo user shall be taken into account and proportional measures to prevent and/or remove the violation shall be taken.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.6</strong> The Jimdo user shall upon first request indemnify Jimdo and hold Jimdo harmless against all claims from third parties, against Jimdo as a result of a violation committed by the Jimdo user against legal regulations, third party rights (in particular personal rights, copyright and/or trademark rights), or as regards contractual duties, representations or guarantees (warranties), including the costs of a legal defense (lawyer\u2019s fees and court costs at the applicable statutory rate).\nIn the event of claims arising from any such behavior, the Jimdo user is obligated to immediately and completely cooperate and clarify the situation, as well as to make all required entries accessible to Jimdo in a suitable manner.</p>14.\nContracts and Cancellations<p>\n<strong>14.1</strong> A free Jimdo website can be deleted by the user at any time using the settings and/or the menu on the respective Jimdo website.\nA Jimdo account can be deleted by the Jimdo user via the dashboard settings.\nTo ensure that a Jimdo account can be deleted by the Jimdo user, only free pages may be linked.\nWhere the Jimdo user has linked chargeable Jimdo pages with the Jimdo account, the contract must first be terminated in accordance with points 14.2, 14.3 and 14.4 of these terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.2</strong> Unless stipulated otherwise in the respective service description, the contract for the fee based packages shall be extended by the same originally agreed period if the contract is not terminated one month prior to the end of the respective term.\nThe user shall be notified via a notification email as to the extension of the contract at least six weeks prior to the contract renewal date.\nThe renewal of the contract shall be deemed to have been agreed to, if the user does not object to the renewal via cancelling their contract within the cancellation period.\nIn the notification email Jimdo shall also inform the User of their right to object/ right to cancel their contract, the time limit for such a cancellation and the result of the User's failure to cancel their contract.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.3</strong> Cancellations can be directly submitted by the Jimdo user via the site they wish to cancel or in text form (e.g.\nEmail, fax, letter).\nFor cancellations that are submitted via email, this email must be sent from the email address that is registered to the Jimdo site concerned.\nNotice of Cancellation can be declared to the next working day or to the end of the current contractual period.\nThe conditions listed under point 14.4 below, are of particular importance for cancellations that are declared to the next working day.\nFees paid in advance shall not be refunded upon termination of the contract or deletion of the site prior to the end of the contract period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.4</strong> Fees paid in advance shall not be refunded upon termination of the contract or deletion of the site prior to the end of the contract period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.5</strong> The Jimdo user has the possibility to purchase additional fee-based \u201cadd-ons\u201d i.e.\nservices, complimentary to their fee-based packages.\nIf the Jimdo user cancels one or more of these fee based additional services, the validity of the remaining provisions of this contractual relationship shall in no way be affected.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.6</strong> The Jimdo user has the possibility to change their current package.\nAn upgrade to another package is possible at any time.\nWhere the jimdo user wishes to downgrade, they must inform Jimdo of this wish at the latest 4 weeks prior to the end of the current contract period.\nIn the case of a downgrade the change shall take effect upon contract renewal.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.7</strong> Jimdo may terminate the contracts with the Jimdo user unilaterally and without stating reasons by giving at least three month\u2019s notice.\nIn such a case Jimdo will refund any fees paid by the User in advance on a pro rata basis.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.8</strong> Either party's mutual right to extraordinary termination for serious reasons remains unaffected.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.9</strong> In particular we shall have the right to terminate the contractual relationship with no notice period if circumstances allow the assumption that the Jimdo user has intentionally or negligently committed \u201cillicit activities\u201d pursuant to point 6 and 13 of these terms or has breached other obligations of these terms.\nSuch a breach and/or non-compliance can also result in further civil and criminal consequences for the Jimdo user.\nInstalments paid in advance shall not be reimbursed in this case.\nThe Jimdo user shall be entitled to demonstrate that non-reimbursement is \u201cunreasonable\u201d in its case.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.10</strong> After termination of the contraction relationship we are no longer obligated to provide the contracted services.\nWe can delete all data of the Jimdo user that are located on our services, including all emails located in the relevant mailboxes.\nTransferring the user\u2019s complete Jimdo, internet presence to the servicer of a third party is not possible.\nIt is therefore the responsibility of the Jimdo user to store and backup the data in a timely fashion.\nFurthermore, Jimdo i.e.\nthe Service Provider may, upon termination of the contract, have any of the Jimdo users domains which have not been transferred to a new provider deleted by the relevant registrar (\u201cCLOSE\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.11</strong> In addition to the rights granted by Jimdo pursuant to these general terms and conditions, Jimdo can take further action if Jimdo ascertains that a security breach on the website of a Jimdo user could lead to unauthorised disclosure of customer information, or can request that the Jimdo user provides Jimdo with information concerning such a breach.</p>15.\nPrivacy Policy and Data Protection<p>\n<strong>15.1</strong> We shall ensure that personal data of Jimdo users is only collected, stored and

Jimdo user in good time in the event of a scheduled change of a relevant subcontractor or in the event of a scheduled commissioning of a new subcontractor, as described in the commissioned data processing contract (\u201cinformation\u201d).\nShould the Client object to this change, the Contractor can terminate the contractual relationship with the Client with a notice period of at least 14 days to the end of a calendar month.\nWith such notice period the Contractor shall give appropriate consideration to the interests of the Client.\nIf no objection of the Client is received within three weeks of receiving the \u201cinformation\u201d, the change and/or new engagement of the relevant subcontractor shall be deemed approved by the Client.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.5</strong> Respective current information on the purpose, type and scope of the collection, processing and use of personal data is available in the data protection notice, which can be retrieved at any time via the \u201cData Protection\u201c link, as well as in the commissioned data processing contract.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.6</strong> As part of its services Jimdo can provide general data protection, cookie, imprint, business information and other relevant information, text templates or text generators from third parties on the respective page of the Jimdo user or in their website administration area.\nThis general information and/or the technical possibility to create these texts does not constitute and is not to be understood as legal advice pursuant to the German Legal Services Act (Rechtsdienstleistungsgesetz RDG) and Jimdo shall assume no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness and/or legality of its content or its suitability for the respective Jimdo website/for the

legal requirements.</p>16.\nLimitations of Liability<p>\n<strong>16.1</strong> In cases of gross negligence or premeditation we, Jimdo shall be liable for all damages caused by us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.2</strong> In cases of minor negligence we are only liable for damage resulting from death, physical injury or harm to human health.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.3</strong>

proper performance of the contract and the fulfillment of such is regularly relied upon by the user.\nIn such cases liability is limited to the replacement of foreseeable, typically occurring damage and at a maximum is restricted to the to the equivalent amount of a yearly user fee for the jimdo site affected.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.4</strong> Insofar as our liability under the foregoing provisions
