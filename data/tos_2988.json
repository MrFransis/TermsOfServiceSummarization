media company owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).\nThis Cookie Statement explains how we use cookies and similar technologies in the course of our business, including through our websites that link to this Cookie Statement, such as http://www.techreview.com,&nbsp;http://www.technologyreview.com, http://subscribe.technologyreview.com, and&nbsp;https://events.technologyreview.com, or any website or mobile application owned, operated or controlled by us (collectively, \u201cWebsites\u201d or \u201cwebsites\u201d).\nIt explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.\nThis Cookie Statement is and will be treated as part of our Terms of Service and is automatically incorporated therein.\nCapitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Cookie Statement have the meanings given to those terms in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>In some cases, we may use cookies and other tracking technologies described in this Cookie Statement to collect Personal Information, or to collect information that becomes Personal Information if we combine it with other information.\nFor more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our Privacy Policy.</p> What are cookies? <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.\nCookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>\n<p>Cookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, MIT Technology Review) are called \u201cfirst party cookies\u201d.\nCookies set by parties other than the website owner are called \u201cthird party cookies\u201d.\nThird party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics).\nThe third parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.</p> Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies? <p>We use first party and third-party cookies for several reasons.\nSome cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites and Services to operate, and we refer to these as \u201cessential\u201d or \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d cookies.\nOther cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of visitors to our Websites, and we refer to these as \u201cperformance\u201d or \u201cfunctionality\u201d cookies.\nFor example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Websites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Services we provide.\nWe also enable our users to employ cookies and similar tracking technologies in connection with their use of our Services in order to allow us and our users to track their subscribers.\nFinally, third parties serve cookies through our Websites and Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.\nThis is described in more detail below.</p> Cookies served through our Websites Strictly Necessary Cookies <p>These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.\nThey are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms.<br>\n<br>You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.\nThese cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>COOKIES

Other tracking technologies <p>We and our third-party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or \u201cclear gifs\u201d) and other tracking technologies.\nThese are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an e-mail that we have sent them.\nThis allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns.\nWhile you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly.\naccordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies.</p> Targeted online advertising <p>We have engaged one or more third party service providers to track and analyze both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Websites.\nWe also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to display advertising on our Websites and/or to manage and serve advertising on other sites.</p>\n<p>These third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Websites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (\u201cInterest Based Advertising\u201d).\nFor more information about this practice, click here:&nbsp;http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>\n<p>Our third-party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Websites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads).\nThe information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g.\nby reference to your name or email address).</p> How can I control cookies? <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Website Cookie Preference Tool:</strong>&nbsp;You can exercise preferences about what cookies are served on our Websites by visiting the TRUSTe preference center by clicking this link:http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Browser Controls:</strong>&nbsp;You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.\nIf you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Websites though your access to some functionality and areas of our Websites may be restricted.\nAs the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser\u2019s help menu for more information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disabling Most Interest Based Advertising:</strong>&nbsp;Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of Interest Based Advertising.\nIf you would like to find out more information, please visit&nbsp;http://www.aboutads.info/choices/&nbsp;or&nbsp;http://www.youronlinechoices.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile Advertising:</strong>&nbsp;You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of Interest Based Advertising, including those performed by us, by accessing the settings in your Apple or Android mobile device and following the most recent published instructions.\nIf you opt out, we will remove all data about you and no further data collection or tracking will occur.\nThe random ID we (or our third party partners) had previously assigned to you will also be removed.\nThis means that if at a later stage, you decide to opt-in, we will not be able to continue and track you using the same ID as before, and you will for all practical purposes be a new user to our system.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Not Track:</strong>&nbsp;Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit \u201cDo Not Track\u201d or \u201cDNT\u201d signals.\nSince uniform standards for \u201cDNT\u201d signals have not been adopted, our Websites do not currently process or respond to \u201cDNT\u201d signals.\nMIT Technology Review takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.\nTo learn more about \u201cDNT\u201d, please visit All About Do Not Track.</p> How often will you update this Cookie Statement? <p>We may update this Cookie Statement from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.\nPlease therefore re-visit this Cookie Statement regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.</p>\n<p>The date at the bottom of this Cookie Statement indicates when it was last updated.</p> Where can I get further information? <p>If you have any

communicate with us in any manner other than through the Services.\nBecause the Internet is global, information about you that we collect or that you submit, in each case in connection with your use of the Services, may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries (including the United States) other than the one in which you reside.\nBy using the Services, you explicitly consent to such use of your information and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p> Information MIT Technology Review Collects <p>MIT Technology Review may collect two (2) types of information about you: Personal and Non-Personal.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Personal Information.\n\"Personal Information\" refers to information that lets MIT Technology Review know the specifics of who you are and which may be used to identify, contact or locate you (e.g., name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address).\nMIT Technology Review may collect Personal Information when you use our Services, including, without limitation, this list of options (herein, \"Shared Information\"):<ol>\n<li>Registration.\nRegistration for MIT Technology Review requires that you supply certain personally identifiable

profile on our Services by utilizing a supplied third-party login provider (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, OpenID).\nBy doing this, you are asking each login provider to send us registration information from your profile within their service.\nWe treat that information as we do any other information you give us when you log on, register, or create a profile.</li>\n<li>User-Generated Comments and Public Activities (including Comments and Social Sharing).\nWe offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on our Services.\n\"Public Activities\" are any actions you take on MIT Technology Review or Twitter and Facebook that are designed to be visible to other users on our Services, including commenting and posting to Facebook or Twitter.\nAny information you disclose in your Public Activities, including your screen name, and any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by MIT Technology Review, without notice to or consent from you and without compensation to you, for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.\nIf you chose to engage in Public Activities, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to submit can be read, collected, and used by other readers of these areas, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.\nWe are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums, and MIT Technology Review has no responsibility to publish, take down, remove, or edit any Public Activities.</li>\n<li>If you have signed up for an MIT Technology Review account, we will track and aggregate your Public Activities on our Services.\nIf you choose to participate in Public Activities, you are electing to share and display such Public Activities on our Services.\nAlso, Public Activities may be included in RSS feeds or APIs and made available to other websites in other formats.\nAs a result, your Public Activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds.</li>\n<li>Contests, Sweepstakes, and Special Offers.\nMIT Technology Review may collect information from you in connection with contests, sweepstakes, and special offers.\nIf this information is shared with a third party, we will notify you at the time of collection.\nIf you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest, or special offer.</li>\n<li>Surveys, Panels, and Market Research.\nMIT Technology Review may collect personal information from you in connection with voluntary surveys.\nUnless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection, the information you provide in response to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in aggregate form, with advertisers and partners.</li>\n<li>Usage Data.\nMIT Technology Review may collect information as you interact with the Services.\nFor example, each time you visit the Services, we may automatically collect the Web page you came from, the URL you go to next, and the Web page(s) that you access during your visit.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Non-Personal Information.\n\"Non-Personal Information\" refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g., demographic information or website visits).\nMIT Technology Review may collect Non-Personal Information through any of the methods discussed above, as well as automatically through use of industry standard technologies described further below.\nFor example, each time you visit the Services, we may automatically collect

Review Network, and failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or termination of access to any or all of the MIT Technology Review Network.</li>\n<li>Information Collected Through Technology.\nMIT Technology Review Services may gather the previously referenced Personal Information and Non-Personal Information by the following methods:<ol>\n<li>Cookies.\nCookies, including local shared objects, are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.\nThey work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the MIT Technology Review Services.\nCookies do not generally contain any Personal Information.\nMost Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your

networks, to collect information about your visit-including the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with our Services-and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you.We also may allow certain analytic services and providers of applications used on the Services (e.g., sharing buttons) to collect Non-Personal Information by placing cookies on the Services that will track certain performance measures, such as Web traffic, click-throughs, etc., in order to assist us and our service providers in better understanding and serving the interests of our users.</li>\n<li>IP Address.\nYou may visit many areas of the MIT Technology Review Services anonymously without becoming a registered User.\nEven in such cases, MIT Technology Review may collect IP addresses automatically.\nAn IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin Services with an Internet service provider.\nEach time you access the MIT Technology Review Services and each time you request one of MIT Technology Review's pages, the server logs your IP address.</li>\n<li>Beacons.\nBeacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in Web pages, applications, and e-mails.\nMIT Technology Review may use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that MIT Technology Review sends to users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails.</li>\n<li>Tracking Content Usage.\nIf you use the MIT Technology Review Services and you post MIT Technology Review materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, pictures, advertisements, sound, and other related content contained in such materials (collectively, \"Content\") to

identify you.<ol>\n<li>Targeted Advertising.\nIn order to serve offers and advertisements that may be of interest to our users, we may display targeted advertisements on the Services based on Personal Information and Non-Personal Information provided by those users, including zip code and profile.</li>\n<li>Your Options and Information about Advertisers and Targeted Ads.\nYou can learn more about the advertising companies and what options they may offer you regarding cookies and targeted advertising by reviewing the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out directory.\nMany of these companies are also members of the Network Advertising Initiative or the Digital Advertising Alliance, which each provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from participating companies.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Aggregated Data.\nFrom time to time, we may share aggregated User Information with third parties.\nWe will not, however, share any aggregated data in manner that would enable the recipient to personally identify you.</li>\n<li>Service Providers.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into relationships with third parties who provide services to us (e.g., data management and storage services or credit card processing services).\nIn those circumstances, we disclose User Information that is necessary for such service providers to perform those services, and we require that they maintain the confidentiality of such User Information.</li>\n<li>Other Disclosure Scenarios.\nNotwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right, and you hereby expressly authorize us, to share any User Information: (1) in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.\n(2) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potentially illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property.\n(3) if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding significant abuse of the Services' infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as voluminous spamming, denial-of-service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information).\n(4) with MIT, its subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control with us (in which case we will require such entities to honor this Privacy Policy).\nand (5) if we are acquired by or merged with another entity.</li>\n</ol> Public Information <p>If you identify any User Information as public, you are authorizing us to share such information publicly.\nFor example, you may elect to make certain Shared Information (such as your alias, bio, e- mail or photos) publicly available.\nAlso, there may be areas of the Services (e.g., message boards, discussion rooms, and other digital forums) in which you are able to post information that will be available to all other users of the Services.\nBy choosing to use these areas, you understand and agree that anyone may access, use, and disclose any information that you post to them.\nWe are not responsible for the use or misuse by others of any such information.</p> Mobile and Location-Based Services <p>We may from time to time offer certain location- or pinpoint-based services with our applications (such as GPS-assisted navigation instruction, wireless tower location, triangulation, or other available location technologies).\nIf you elect to use such location-based services, we must periodically receive your location in order to provide the services to you.\nBy using the applications' location-based services, you authorize us to: (a) locate your hardware.\n(b) record, compile, and display your location.\nand (c) publish your location to third parties designated by you by means of location publication controls available within the applications (e.g., settings, user preferences).\nAs part of the applications, we may also collect and store certain information about our users, such as users' wireless mobile subscriber ISDN and/or IMEI numbers (as applicable) and users' network access identifier information.\nThis information will be used to provide you with the services accessed through our applications.\nWe may use third-party providers to help provide services through mobile systems, and such providers may use the information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p> How We Safeguard Your Personal Information <ol>\n<li>Security Measures.\nMIT Technology Review takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of Personal Information.\nThese include, but are not limited to, internal reviews of: (a) MIT Technology Review's data collection.\n(b) storage and processing practices.\n(c) electronic security measures.\nand (d) physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where MIT Technology Review stores Personal Information.\nAll MIT Technology Review employees, contractors, and agents who access Personal Information are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, for unauthorized use or disclosure of Personal Information.</li>\n<li>Third-Party Links.\nThe MIT Technology Review Network may contain links to third parties who may collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information directly from you.\nAdditionally, MIT Technology Review may use third parties to provide components of the MIT Technology Review Network.\nIn either case, such third parties may have separate privacy policies and data collection practices, independent of MIT Technology Review.\nMIT Technology Review: (a) has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions.\n(b) is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.\nand (c) does not make any warranties or representations about the contents, products, or services offered on such websites or the security of any information you provide to them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>MIT Technology Review continually strives to implement new technologies and processes to better protect you, your privacy, and your use of the MIT Technology Review Network.\nAs a result, changes to this Privacy Policy may be made by MIT Technology Review from time to time.\nIn no event will these changes result in the degradation of any of the security measures designed to protect you from unauthorized disclosure, as such measures are described in this Privacy Policy.</p> Children's Privacy <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy needs of children, and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests.\nThe Services are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13.\nWe

Services\").\nThis may include other websites operated by employees of MIT.\nThe policies and procedures we describe here do not apply to the Third-Party Services.\nThe links from this Service do not imply that MIT Technology Review endorses or has reviewed the Third-Party Services.\nWe suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p> Other Terms and Conditions <p>Your access to and use of these Services are subject to the&nbsp;Terms of Service.</p> Changes to MIT Technology Review's Privacy Policy <p>Our Services and our business may change from time to time.\nAs a result, at times it may be necessary for MIT Technology Review to make changes to this Privacy Policy.\nMIT Technology Review reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice.\nPlease review this policy periodically, and especially before you provide additional Personal Information.\nThis Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated below.\nYour continued use of the Service after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of the revised Privacy
