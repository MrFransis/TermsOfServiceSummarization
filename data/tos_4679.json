any act of sexual conduct, apparently created or published without their explicit permission.</p>\n<p>This applies even if a person is fully clothed, and/or in public.\nImages of body parts recontextualised in a salacious manner (e.g.\n\u2018Upskirt\u2019, \u2018Creepshots\u2019) also fall under this restriction.</p> Sexual or suggestive content involving minors <p>Aether does not allow any sexual or suggestive content, involving minors, or person(s) who appear to be minors, whether be it videos, photos, 3D renderings, animation, or in any other form.</p> Content that encourages or

else\u2019s personal information online.\n(e.g.\n\u2018Doxxing\u2019) Public figures can sometimes be an exception to this rule depending on the context.\nAs an example, if you\u2019re posting the contact email, of your local representative, that is fine, if you\u2019re posting his or her home address, or garage PIN code, it is not.</p> Content that uses Aether to solicit or facilitate any transaction or gift involving certain goods and services <p>Aether is not intended to be a marketplace.</p>\n<p>Specifically, using Aether to seek, buy, sell, or otherwise facilitate transactions of these types of items is not allowed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Firearms, ammunition or explosives of any kind, or instructions to make them, whether be it written, in computer code (e.g.\n3D printing

not create multiple accounts with the purpose of being able to vote multiple times on the same content or in the same moderator election cycle.</p>\n<p>Creating multiple accounts to post in different communities is okay, so long as you don\u2019t vote on content or people twice.</p> Do not break Aether <p>Aether is a commons that works with the collaboration and participation of all its users.\nDon\u2019t break it, or do anything that interferes with its normal use.\nBy way of example, and not as a limitation, do not post base64 encoded images (or similar) in text
