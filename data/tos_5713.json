your family members can track their day on the mountain.</p>\n<p>Some of our resorts and products have Apps available for download to your mobile device.\nThe download, installation and use of our Apps will allow you convenient access to great experiences our resorts have to offer, including the ability to purchase pass products, lift tickets, track and share your performance, create a profile, create social groups with whom you can share information, access mountain wayfinding, weather and lift info, and receive in-App notifications (collectively, the \u201cApps Services\u201d).\nIf you access our Apps, we may be able to collect your Personal Information, including your geographic location, activities, and purchase history.\nWe may also associate the information collected through your use of the Apps to your customer profile, including your pass product and pass scan data.</p>\n<p>The Apps automatically collect detailed location and navigation information, in the form of GPS signals from the mobile device on which you have installed and activated the App (\u201cApp Location Information\u201d).\nWhenever you open, use or interact with the App Services, we use your App Location Information (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the App Services experience to your current location.\nWe also use your App Location Information to provide certain App Services, including to send you notifications of friends, events, or other relevant information that are near to you.\nIf you have \u2018background location\u2019 turned on, the Apps may, from time to time, tell us about your device\u2019s location even if you are not directly interacting with the App.\nWe may use various technologies to determine your App Location Information, such as location services of the applicable operating system or browser, GPS, Bluetooth, i-Beacon, RFID, and sensor data from your devices, along with nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers, and other technologies to determine your mobile devices\u2019 approximate location.</p>\n<p>The Apps may also share your App Location Information on a map or by communicating your distance and general direction to other users.\nYou should only share your App Location Information with those that you trust.\nYou understand that the nature of location-based services is such that your App Location Information is available to you and other users, and that we cannot control what you or other users, who receive this information when using the App or the App Services, will do with it.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish for the Apps to track your App Location Information, you should turn off the App Location Information tracking feature in the App settings menu.\nIf you turn off the App Location Information feature, some features of the App and App Services cannot be provided without using this standard technology.\nFor example, the App Services use your location and route information to create a detailed location history of your journeys made when using the App and App Services.\nThe Apps use this history to offer the App Services to you, to improve the quality of the App Services it offers to you and to all of its users and to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data.</p>\n<p>You may be able to take part in certain activities within our App Services that let you communicate or share information not just with us, but also with other users.\nThese include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sending private or group messages or content to other users</li>\n<li>chatting with other users</li>\n<li>sharing performance metrics, such as your total days skied, vertical feet skied, and number of chairlift rides</li>\n<li>sharing your skill-level, home mountain, and/or personal preferences</li>\n<li>sharing photos or drawings with other users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We record and store archives of this data on servers to provide these features as well as to protect our rights and
