personal information that is subject to the CCPA, we are committed to processing your personal information in a transparent and fair manner and in compliance with the CCPA.\nThis section describes the rights California residents have in relation to your personal information and provides the notices required by the CCPA.</p> A.\nYOUR CCPA RIGHTS <p>The CCPA grants California residents the rights described below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Right to Know General Collection and Use of Personal Information (Access Request)</b>.\nUnder the CCPA, California residents have the right to request that Verisign disclose what information we have collected, used, disclosed, or sold over the past 12 months.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request for such information, we will disclose to you, based on your specific request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you over the past 12 months;</li>\n<li>The categories of sources from which the personal information is collected over the past 12 months;</li>\n<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information over the past 12 months;</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties with whom we shared your personal information over the past 12 months;</li>\n<li>If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, the personal information categories that each category of recipients obtained.\nand/or</li>\n<li>If we sold your personal information for a business purpose, the personal information categories that each category of recipients purchased.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Right to Know Specific Pieces of Personal Information (Data Portability)</b>.\nUpon your verified request for such information, we will disclose to you certain specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you over the past 12 months.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Right to Request Deletion</b>.\nYou have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete your personal information from our records, and direct our service providers to do the same, unless an exception applies.</p>\n<p>Some of the exceptions that would allow us to deny a request for deletion include if the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform a contract we have with you.</li>\n<li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>\n<li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>\n<li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>\n<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.\nPenal Code \u00a7 1546 et.\nseq.).</li>\n<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>\n<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>\n<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information</b>.\nYou have the right to direct businesses that sell personal information to not sell your personal information (the \"right to opt-out\").\nVerisign currently does not sell personal information of California residents to third parties, including the personal information of California residents who are under 16 years of age.\nDuring the preceding 12 months Verisign offered an Internet Profile Service, which gathered and sold information from public websites to provide customers intelligence about .com and .net domain names.\nWe no longer include information about California residents as part of this service.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Right to Non-Discrimination</b>.\nYou have the right not to be discriminated against for having exercised the rights established by the CCPA.\nWe will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.</li>\n<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n</ul> B.\nEXERCISING YOUR CCPA RIGHTS <p>This section of our Privacy Statement explains how a California resident can exercise their rights.</p>\n<p>To exercise your right to know or your right to deletion, you or your authorized agent may submit a verifiable consumer request in one of the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Call us toll free at 1-800-255-2218.</li>\n<li>Fill out this form.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upon receipt of your request to know or request for deletion, we will confirm receipt within 10 days.\nIf we are able to verify your request, we will make our best effort to respond within forty-five (45) days of our receipt of your request.\nIf we require more time (up to 45 additional days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional Information About Requests to Know</b>\n</p>\n<p>When responding to a request to know, we will not disclose information to you if we cannot verify your identity.</p>\n<p>The CCPA allows a California resident to make a verifiable consumer request to know only twice within a 12-month period.\nAdditionally, the verifiable consumer request must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1.\nProvide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are: (i) the person about whom we collected personal information, or (ii) an authorized representative.</li>\n<li>2.\nDescribe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Additional Information About Requests to Delete</b>\n</p>\n<p>When responding to a request for deletion, we will specify the manner in which we have deleted your personal information, in accordance with the CCPA.\nWe will not delete your information if we cannot verify your identity.</p> C.\nDESIGNATING AN AUTHORIZED AGENT <p>Only you as a California resident, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf (Authorized Agent), may make a verifiable request to know or a request for deletion.\nIf you are using an Authorized Agent to exercise your CCPA rights, we require the Authorized Agent to provide us with written confirmation that you have authorized them to act on your behalf.\nWe may also verify the identity of the Authorized Agent.</p> D.\nHOW WE VERIFY CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS\u2019 REQUESTS TO KNOW AND REQUESTS FOR DELETION <p>We will not respond to requests to know or requests for deletion unless we can verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty.\nTo verify your identity, when feasible, we will use information about you that we already have.\nhowever, on occasion we may need to request additional information, which we will use only for the purposes of verification.\nWe may also use a third-party identify verification service.</p>\n<p>The information we need to verify your request will depend on the type of request, the sensitivity of the personal information requested, and/or the risk of harm to you.\nUpon receipt of your request, we will notify you if we need additional information from you to verify your request.</p> E.\nNOTICE AT COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION (FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS) <p>This <b>Notice
