of their marketing campaigns by understanding which marketing campaigns contributed to the download/installation of their mobile applications (\u201c<strong>Applications</strong>\u201c) or such other conversion metric (e.g.\nrelaunch of Application).\nand (ii) measure and analyze certain events and actions within their Application or websites, such as in-app purchases made by End Users (as defined below).\nThe Services also help our Customers identify and protect against fraudulent behavior related to their marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p>This Services Privacy Policy describes AppsFlyer\u2019s privacy practices in relation to the information collected from Customers and End Users and received by AppsFlyer when Customers use our Services.\nThis Services Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through use of AppsFlyer\u2019s publicly accessible website or marketing activities, which is described under our Website Privacy Policy.\nTo view the Website Privacy Policy, please click here.\nFurthermore, AppsFlyer and its Customers have entered into an agreement that governs the provision of Services by AppsFlyer and their use by Customers (\u201c<strong>Agreement(s)</strong>\u201c).\nSuch Agreements may contain additional obligations on the parties with respect to the handling of information.\nNothing in this Services Privacy Policy derogates from such additional obligations.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of this Services Privacy Policy: (i) any reference to \u201c<strong>End User(s)</strong>\u201d means end users who have interacted with, or viewed, Customer\u2019s advertising and marketing materials, or use or have used Customer\u2019s Applications, websites, products and services.\nand (ii) any reference to <strong>\u201cAppsFlyer\u201d</strong>\n<strong>\u201cwe\u201d</strong>\n<strong>\u201cus\u201d</strong> or <strong>\u201cour\u201d</strong> shall means AppsFlyer Ltd.\nand its affiliates.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>END USER DATA RECEIVED AND PROCESSED BY APPSFLYER</strong>\n<p>When a Customer uses the Services, the following End User information may be received and processed by AppsFlyer (collectively, <strong>\u201cEnd User Data\u201d</strong>).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>\u201cTechnical Information\u201d</strong>: this refers to technical information related to an End User\u2019s mobile device or computer, such as: browser type, device type and model, CPU, system language, memory, OS version, Wi-Fi status, time stamp and zone, device motion parameters and carrier.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\u201cTechnical Identifiers\u201d</strong>: this refers to various unique identifiers that generally only identify a computer, device, browser or Application.\nFor example, IP address (which may also provide general location information), User agent, IDFA (identifier for advertisers), Android ID (in Android devices).\nGoogle Advertiser ID, Customer issued user ID and other similar unique identifiers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\u201cEngagement Information\u201d</strong>: this refers to information relating to the Customer\u2019s ad campaigns and End User actions, such as: clicks on Customer ads, ad impressions viewed, audiences or segments to which an ad campaign is attributed, the type of ads and the webpage or Application from which such ads were displayed, the webpages on Customer\u2019s website visited by an End User, the URL from the referring website, downloads and installations of Applications, and other interactions, events and actions Customers choose to measure and analyze within their Application or website (e.g.\nadd to cart, in-app purchases made, clicks, engagement time etc.).</li>\n<li>While End User Data does not generally contain any information that directly identifies an individual, such as names, addresses, credit cards or other similarly regulated financial information, health information, or any other type of sensitive personal information (\u201c<strong>PII</strong>\u201c), we acknowledge that under certain jurisdictions the End User Data we do receive when a Customer uses the Services may be deemed personal data and therefore, where applicable, will be treated as such.\nWithin the scope of the engagement between Customers and AppsFlyer, Customers are contractually prohibited from collecting PII, unless otherwise agreed by AppsFlyer.\nHowever, Customers have sole control over their properties (including their websites and Application) and configuration of the Services and thus Customers have the technical ability to configure the Services to collect PII.\nThis includes, for example, a Customer using an End User\u2019s email address as a Customer issued user ID Technical Identifier.\nIf a Customer has configured the Services to collect PII then we may receive and process such data.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>REGISTRATION INFORMATION RECEIVED AND PROCESSED BY

representatives who are using the Services (e.g.\nemail, phone number and address).\nWhen a Customer uses the Services, AppsFlyer may also collect certain log data, such as IP address from which a
