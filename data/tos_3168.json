(including the Covered Parties) including, without limitation, any matter concerning the Site Offerings, the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in New York, NY, in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration rules of the AAA.\nand (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice which can be found here.\n[PLEASE INSERT THIS

Initial Dispute Notice (\u201cFinal Settlement Offer\u201d).\nIf we provide you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute and you wish to proceed, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before the AAA, in your county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is available here.\nFor claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.\nIf the arbitrator awards you relief that is

with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys' fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration.\nAny award rendered shall be final

to pay the attorney's fees and court costs that any Covered Party incurs in seeking such relief.\nThis provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (i) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above.\nand (ii) is an independent agreement.\nYou may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the
