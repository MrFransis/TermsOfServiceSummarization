MARU/BLUE COOKIE POLICY <p>\nThis Cookie Policy (the \u201dPolicy\u201d) describes how Maru/Blue Canada Inc.\nand Maru/Blue US LLC (collectively \u201cMaru/Blue\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and store information when you visit this website (the \u201cSite\u201d).\nFor additional information on our privacy practices, please visit our privacy policy.\n</p>\n<p>\nShould you have any questions regarding this Policy, you can contact our Privacy Officer by email at privacy@marublue.net, or by mail at:\n</p>\n<p>\n2 Bloor Street East, Suite 1600<br>\nToronto, Ontario M4W 1A8<br>\nAttention: Privacy Officer<br>\n</p>\n<p>\nYou may also call us at any of our numbers listed at https://www.marublue.net/contact.\n</p> WHAT ARE COOKIES? <p>\nWhen you visit the Site, Maru/Blue or a third party may send you a cookie.\nCookies are small text files that may be placed in your browser directory on your computer or mobile device.\nWhen a website is accessed, a cookie that is placed on a device will send information to the party that has placed the cookie.\nCookies are extremely common and used on most websites.\nEach cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the \u201clifetime\u201d of the cookie, and a value (usually a unique number).\nFor a more thorough explanation of what cookies are and how they operate, please visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org.\n</p> WHY ARE COOKIES USEFUL? <p>\nIn general, the purpose of cookies is to improve the performance of the Site and your experience while visiting the Site.\nCookies help make your visits easier by recognizing you upon return and providing a customized experience.\nCookies also allow us to do useful things.\nfor example, cookies allow us to find out whether you have visited the Site previously.\nCookies help us make the Site work more efficiently, enable extra functionality, and provide us with additional information about your visit.\nCookies also allow us to track overall Site usage and determine areas that users prefer.\n</p> FIRST PARTY AND THIRD PARTY COOKIES <p>\nOur Site may place first party cookies and allow third parties to place cookies on your device.\nThe difference between a first party cookie and a third party cookie relates to the control of the party who serves the cookie.\nFirst party cookies are cookies that are specific to the website that created them.\nTheir use enables us to operate an efficient service and to track the patterns of behavior of visitors to the Site.\nThird party cookies, on the other hand, are placed on your device by a third party (i.e., not by Maru/Blue).\nWhile we may allow third parties access to the Site to place these cookies on users\u2019 devices, for example by embedding functionality such as Social Media widgets, we do not retain control over the information supplied by the cookies, nor do we retain access to that data.\nSome third party cookies have the ability to track your browsing activity across sites, such as ad networks which are intended to deliver relevant, targeted ads to you and services delivered on external websites.\nThis information is controlled wholly by those third parties in accordance with their respective privacy policies.\nWe do not share your personal information with the third parties for their own use.\n</p> SESSION AND PERSISTENT COOKIES <p>\nOur Site may place session and persistent cookies on your device.\nWhereas the difference between a first party and third party cookie relates to the party controlling the initial placement of the cookie on your device, the difference between a session and a persistent cookie relates to the length of time the cookie lasts.\nSession cookies are cookies that typically last for as long as you are using your browser, also known as a browser session.\nWhen you end your browser session, the cookie expires.\nPersistent cookies, as the name implies, are persistent and will last after you close your browser.\nThis allows for quicker and often more convenient access to our Site among other functionality.\n</p> LINKING OF COOKIE DATA WITH OTHER DATA <p>\nInformation gathered through usage of a cookie is not generally linked to any direct personal identifiers (e.g., your name or e-mail address).\nOnce you submit personal data on our sites however (e.g., by signing up to receive information from us, become a customer, etc.), we may link such personal data with cookies or other data that are associated with your visit(s) to our Site.\nThis linkage allows us to create a \u2018profile\u2019 of your preferences so that we may tailor Site content, offers, and promotions to your interests.\n</p> DISABLING, DELETING, OR OPTING OUT OF COOKIES <p>\nIf you do not want to have cookies placed on your device by third parties, many of them offer ways to opt-out.\nMost web browsers allow you to view and control most cookies through browser settings.\nYou may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser to decline cookies.\nYou may also delete existing cookies through your browser.\nInformation on deleting/controlling cookies for specific browsers can be found at www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org.\nPlease note that if you delete cookies, or visit from another browser or device, you may need to set your preferences again including opt-out preferences.\nIf you disable cookies, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site.\nIn particular, you may have limited access to some areas or be transitioned to a different experience.Please note that if you delete cookies, or visit from another browser or device, you may need to set your preferences again including opt-out preferences.\nIf you disable cookies, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Site.\nIn particular, you may have limited access to some areas or be transitioned to a different experience.\n</p> SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES <p>\nThere are other technologies that perform a similar function to cookies.\nThese include web beacons and clear gifs, local shared objects (also known as \u201cLSOs\u201d or \u201cFlash cookies\u201d), and digital fingerprints.\nThese technologies may be used in conjunction with cookies to help us generate additional functionality and data:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web beacons/clear gifs \u2013 When we send you newsletters or other messages we use these technologies so that we can track email open and click rates, which in conjunction with cookies helps us understand your interests and send you more relevant, targeted messages.</li>\n<li>Digital fingerprinting \u2013 When you become a member of our Market Communities, we use \u201cdigital fingerprinting\u201d technology to help us uniquely identify you, and to ensure the integrity of survey results by suppressing duplicate accounts, fraudulent surveys, and fraudulent responses.\nTo create the digital fingerprint, we use third party technology to collect data points about your computer and to generate a unique identifier by combining those data points.\nThis digital fingerprint cannot reveal your personal identity on its own, and your personal information is not transferred to any third party via the digital fingerprint without your consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> DO NOT TRACK SIGNAL <p>\nSome browsers allow you to send a \u2018Do Not Track\u2019 request when you visit a website.\nAside from the cookie related settings listed above, this Site does not process Do Not Track signals sent by your browser.\n</p> CHANGES TO THIS POLICY <p>\nMaru/Blue encourages you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed of how we manage your personal information.\nIf any changes are made to this Policy, Maru/Blue will revise the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date that is indicated on the Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Last Updated:

answered it.\nIt does not store what answer you gave to the poll, or any\nother information about you or your browsing history.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis cookie exists only to ensure you aren't offered the same poll too often on a site, and to show you the results for polls you have already answered.\nA cookie is used because our platform - for speed/efficiency reasons - queues the\nanswer you gave before inserting it into our analysis databases.\nBefore your answer has been imported the cookie is the\nonly way the system knows to show you the answers instead of displaying the same question again.\n</p>\nGoogle Analytics\n<p>\nGoogle Analytics is used on this site and will also set cookies of its\nown.\nGoogle Analytics provides important information about how people access the site -

its own in aggregated non-identifiable form.\n</p> ", "created_at": "2021-09-03 21:44:46.239517", "updated_at": "2021-09-03 21:44:57.707377"}, {"id": 8956, "name": "Terms and Conditions", "url":

Springboard America\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From time to time, we may invite you to directly participate in a study being conducted by an \u2018Associate of Maru Springboard America\u2019.&nbsp;Associates are MARU clients who conduct their own studies on another site.\nWhen you complete Associate studies you leave the MSBA environment and are responding directly to third parties.\nTo simplify the survey experience and ensure that you do not have to answer profiling questions that you have previously submitted to us, we will automatically send our Associate certain information about you such as your age, race, region, household income, gender, and other demographic information when you grant your consent to participate.</p>\n<p>All survey data including any personal information you submit when completing these Associate studies is viewable by the Associate.\nParticipation in these surveys is completely voluntary and you may choose not to participate if you wish.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After completing an Associate survey you will then return to Maru Springboard America.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nCommunications from the Site\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to participate in our Market Communities, you must opt-in to receive emails from us.\nThe first email you receive from us will be sent to confirm your subscription and verify that the email address you have provided is valid.\nSubsequent emails will be sent to invite you to participate in surveys, to respond to your inquiries and support requests, to send you newsletters and other informative content, and to administer sweepstakes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nCookies and Related Technologies\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you visit the Site, participate in a survey, access the member portal, or interact with a survey invite email, we use certain technologies to retain your preferences and provide other Site functionality.\nThese technologies include cookies, web beacons, and digital fingerprints.\nTo learn more about these technologies and your options, please visit our&nbsp;cookie policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nOpting-Out\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At any time, you may choose to opt-out of our Market Communities by clicking the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of our emails, by using the Unsubscribe option in the Profile area of the member portal, or by contacting us directly via the contact information listed above.\nPlease note that when you unsubscribe, we will not only cease sending you emails, we will also deactivate your membership.\nAny information you have submitted to us, including survey invites and personal information will continue to be retained in accordance with our data retention practices outlined below.\nAny points you have accumulated and/or sweepstakes eligibility will be immediately forfeited and cannot be reclaimed even if you sign up again at a later date.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Opting-out of our Market Communities does not unsubscribe you from other communities you have chosen to join, including Associate and other client communities.\nIf you have opted-in to participate in an Associate survey or have otherwise become a participant in one of our client's communities and wish to be removed, you will need to contact them directly to unsubscribe.</p>\n<p>Certain communications are transactional in nature and do not provide you the ability to opt-out.\nFor more information, please visit our main&nbsp;privacy policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nChildren\u2019s Privacy\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our Market Communities are not intended for children under the age of 13.\nFrom time to time however, we may conduct surveys that are targeted at children.\nWhen we conduct such surveys, we will request express permission from a parent, legal guardian or other person legally responsible for the child before inviting the child to participate.\nWe do not share the personal information of children with third parties, and participation can be revoked by the parent or guardian at any time by using the options listed above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nData Retention\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We will retain your personal information and survey responses for as long as it remains necessary or relevant for the purposes we have identified or as permitted/required by law.\nFor example, we may need to retain the personal information of an unsubscribed member for the purposes of maintaining the integrity of the study, or to honor that member\u2019s opt-out preference (by retaining the email address).\nIf you would like to explicitly request the removal of your personal information, please contact us using the contact information listed above.\nNon-personal information is not subject to any retention limitations, and may be retained indefinitely.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nChanges to This Policy\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MARU
