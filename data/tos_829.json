comments of everyone who signed.\nWhere the target is a government body or official that requires petition signers to be constituents, we may also provide your postal code and full address.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Avaaz volunteers and event hosts</strong> : From time to time, Avaaz volunteers or event hosts may have access to your contact information, including your name, email address, telephone number, and social media account IDs, to reach out to you about a specific campaign or event.\nThey may contact you directly or through an Avaaz or third-party contact tool at Avaaz\u2019s direction.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Avaaz Community Petition creators</strong> : When you sign a petition created on the Avaaz Community Petitions platform, we provide your name, city, and

signers.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Collaborating organizations &amp.\nthe media</strong> : Sometimes we work with the media or other groups to amplify our impact.\nIn these cases, we may share your name,

UK-registered company limited by guarantee, about UK-specific campaigns.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Service providers</strong> : We work with a wide range of service providers, notably our database administrators, cloud computing services, help desk services, advertising services, data analysts, application service providers, bulk SMS services, voter phone banking services, and other non-governmental organizations.\nThese providers work under strict confidentiality agreements.\nWe do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with

surveys on these platforms.\nThe personal information of survey participants will be transferred to Avaaz and is subject to this Privacy Policy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment processors</strong> : We work with PayPal, Global Collect, and Stripe to help process credit card transactions and other payment methods when you donate to Avaaz.\nThese payment processors will store certain personal information about you.\nPlease refer to their privacy policies to learn more about how they use your personal information.\nIf you choose to become an Avaaz sustainer, or select the EasyDonate option,

Facebook\u2019s Custom Audience and Lookalike Audience programs, which enable us to display campaign promotions to both existing and prospective members when they visit.\nTo do this, we first send a digital fingerprint of your data to Facebook -- not your actual personal information -- and they check if it matches a fingerprint of their data.\nIf you\u2019re a match, Avaaz campaign promotions may then appear when you access Facebook.\nFacebook deletes this information (a) if it does not match with a Facebook account or (b) after they confirm you are a registered account holder.\nFor more

to the legal rights or safety of Avaaz, the Avaaz staff, or members of the Avaaz community.\nSee more below .\n</li>\n</ul> How do we keep your information safe? <p>Avaaz is a global organization with

personally identifiable information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, misuse, or destruction.\nAll donations, including the transmission of payment details and other personal information, are handled over secure, encrypted connections.\nWe take reasonable steps to ensure that cross-border data transfers comply with existing data protection laws, such as working with third party processors certified in the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield frameworks or with those that use standard contractual clauses that bind parties to protect the privacy and security of data.\n</p>\n<p> We hold on to your personal information for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected, unless otherwise required by law.\nIf you request that we stop

email list at any time or to contact us to request to be excluded from our online campaign promotion lists or text messaging.\n</p> What is the lawful basis for processing your information? <p>When we process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we may rely on one or more of the following legal bases: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent</strong> : We will ask for your consent to use your information to send you details about our campaigns, fundraisers, and action opportunities, for targeted advertising and profiling, and if you ever share sensitive personal information with us.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Contractual relationships</strong> : When you donate to us, apply for employment, or otherwise enter into a contract with us, we\u2019ll need to process your personal information.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal obligations</strong> : When strictly necessary, we\u2019ll process your personal information due to a binding legal obligation on us.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legitimate interests</strong> : So long as our use is fair, balanced, and doesn\u2019t unduly impact your rights, we will collect and process your personal information when we have a legitimate interest that serves the Avaaz mission, our services, or our activities.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Processing your Sensitive Personal Data</strong>: We do not seek to collect or otherwise process your sensitive personal information (i.e.\nabout race or ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, etc.) except where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> the processing is required or permitted by applicable law.\nor </li>\n<li> we have obtained your prior explicit consent -- for example, when you volunteer to complete an opinion survey that includes your voting intentions.\n</li>\n</ul> What about personal information we collect about third parties? <p>To further our mission, Avaaz may collect, store, and process the personal information of third parties for public interest purposes: to report on matters of public concern, to protect freedom of expression and democracy, and to equip decision makers with critical information and analysis.\n</p>\n<p> For these purposes, we may collect, alone or in collaboration with trusted third parties, individual\u2019s name, contact, and other identifying information, images, photographs, audio, or video, social media account profiles and information posted or shared via such accounts.\n</p>\n<p> We may collect such data from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, publicly available information, information provided by Avaaz members or others participating in our work, social media platforms and APIs, research databases, fact-checking organizations, and platform analysis software.\nWe\u2019ll keep such data secure and review its retention to ensure its processing remains necessary to our public interest purposes.\n</p>\n<p> We\u2019ll only process such data for purposes permitted under US law, and where applicable, permitted and a proportionate use under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, for example where the processing serves our public interest purposes and does not unfairly affect the rights of others, or has been made public by the individuals concerned.\n</p>\n<p> Any person about whom we may hold personal information in the European Union and European Economic Area and Switzerland, has the same rights as users as detailed in How can you update and correct your personal information?<strong>However, we may not be able to comply with a request where these rights are subject to an exception, for example where we are processing data for journalistic or academic purposes.</strong> Other exceptions include where the use of the personal data is in connection with the prevention and detection of crime or where it is legally privileged.\n</p>\n<p> We will disclose third party data, in the following circumstances: if there is a compelling reason as described above in Do We Share Your Information?.\nas described below in More on Protection of Avaaz and Others.\nor if aligned with our public interest purposes, we may share data with social media platforms, media organizations, fact-checking organizations, decision-makers, and regulatory and law enforcement agencies.\n</p> More on Protection of Avaaz and Others <p>We believe you should have a reasonable expectation of privacy in information you disclose online that is not clearly intended for public dissemination.\nWhere possible, we may attempt to defend this principle even though most jurisdictions currently take the opposition position.\n</p>\n<p> We may attempt not to disclose material in response to overzealous or inappropriate requests.\nWhen we have a good faith belief that the law compels us to do so or when we think justice would be served, we may cooperate with law enforcement authorities or court orders requesting or directing us to disclose personal information of any user of this site.\nShould this happen we will attempt to provide you with notice before we disclose your personal information, unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise as described above in <em>Do We Share Your Information?</em>\n</p> Links to third party websites <p>We may provide links to other websites.\nThis Privacy Policy covers only Avaaz sites.\nWe have no control over external websites and are not responsible for their content or privacy practices.\nPlease read the terms of use and privacy policies for any third party sites you visit via links from this site.\n</p> How can I unsubscribe? <p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from our email list, you may do so via your profile page or by following this link, which is also included in every campaign email that you receive from us.\n</p> How can I get more information? <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, or data protection on this site, you can contact our Data Protection Officer.\nFor your protection, we may only share and update the personal information associated with the specific email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before doing so.\nWe will comply with such requests in a reasonably timely manner.\nPlease do not send sensitive personal information, passwords, banking details, or credit/debit card details via email.\n</p>\n<p> Our Data Protection Officer can be reached when you Contact Us, or when you write to:\n</p>\n<p> Avaaz \u201cData Protection Officer\u201d / 27 Union Square West,

everything that is posted by users in advance, so any content and/or opinions uploaded, expressed or submitted to the site, and all User Contributions, including, articles, responses to questions, and other content, other than the content officially provided by Avaaz, are solely the opinions and the responsibility of the person or entity submitting them and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of Avaaz.\n<u>We are not responsible, or liable to any third party, for the content or accuracy of any materials posted by you or any other user of this website and you agree to bear full responsibility for the content you post to the site</u>.\nWhile we try to investigate all credible complaints about objectionable User Contributions, we cannot ensure individual responses or removal of such content.\n</p> Enforcement of Terms <p>Because the purpose of this website is to serve the Avaaz mission on behalf of the Avaaz community, in order to ensure that it is used only for its intended purpose and that no use of the site endangers Avaaz\u2019s broader mission, Avaaz has the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Remove or refuse to post any User Contributions for any or no reason.\nThis is a decision Avaaz will strive to make fairly, but ultimately it is a decision that is solely up to Avaaz to make.\nIt will be our general practice, however, to consult with our members including through randomized polling to determine what user contributions our membership views as advancing our mission.\nAt all points in this process we will welcome feedback from the community on how we make these decisions as it is the community\u2019s ability to achieve our mission that we are here to serve.\nBut in the end, Avaaz has a legal obligation to ensure that all of our activities advance our mission and we therefore must reserve final judgment on upholding this requirement.\n</li>\n<li> Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion if we believe that such User Contribution violates the Terms of Use, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right, threatens the personal safety of users of this website and the public or could create liability for Avaaz.\n</li>\n<li> Disclose your identity to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy.\nWe will not do this lightly, but if we think it has the potential to facilitate a fair and just resolution of the dispute, or will protect Avaaz from liability for which we are not responsible, we may take this step.\nSee More on Protection of Avaaz and Others in our Privacy Policy.\n</li>\n<li> Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of this website when we determine law enforcement is the proper and appropriate means for addressing the offending use.\n</li>\n<li> Terminate your access to all or part of this website for any violation of these Terms of Use.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You waive and hold harmless Avaaz from any claims resulting from any action taken by Avaaz during or as a result of its investigations and from any actions taken as a consequence of investigations by either Avaaz or law enforcement
