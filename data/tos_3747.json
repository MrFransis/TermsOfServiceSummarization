aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use fly.io, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events.\nFor example, we may compile statistics on the usage of HTTP content types across fly.io.\nHowever, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.</p>\n<p>We do not host advertising on fly.io.\nWe may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads.\nWhile we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show.</p>\n<p>We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested.</p>\n<p>We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy

cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of fly.io.</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to our site.\nCookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting fly.io.\nhowever, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user.\nThe cookies fly.io sets are essential for the operation of the website, or are used for performance or functionality.\nBy using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device.\nIf you disable your browser or device\u2019s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use GitHub\u2019s services.</p> Google Analytics<p>We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we don\u2019t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information.\nWe use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use fly.io.\nThis helps us evaluate

site that sets a cookie.\nWhile we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can\u2019t always control what cookies this third party content sets.</p> Tracking<p>\"Do Not Track\" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services.\nWe do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of here.\nBecause we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection on fly.io for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in turning on your browser\u2019s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the Do Not Track website has browser-specific instructions.</p>\n<p>Please see our section on email communication to learn about our use of pixel tags in marketing
