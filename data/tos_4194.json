Translated Works by Customer pursuant to subsection (b) below.<br> (b) Smartcat will submit Translated Works to Customer for Customer\u2019s review as to compliance with requirements and specifications identified in the applicable Service Task (\u201cAcceptance Review\u201d).\nCustomer will complete its Acceptance Review within five (5) business days unless another period is agreed

Customer\u2019s Acceptance of the Translated Works (\u201cAcceptance\u201d) or of the Translated Works\u2019 failure to meet Customer\u2019s acceptance criteria (\u201cRejection\u201d), provided however, that failure by Customer to deliver any notice in accordance with this section during the Review Period, will constitute automatic Acceptance of the subject Translated Works by Customer.\nFailure by Smartcat to deliver Translated Works to Customer within the timeframe identified therefore in the applicable Service Task may constitute cause for a Rejection of such Translated Works by Customer.<br> (c) In the event of a justified Rejection by Customer, Smartcat will, at the option of Customer, either: (i) use reasonable commercial efforts to correct and remedy the failure(s) or deficiency(ies) identified by Customer (using the same or another Supplier (as defined in Section 1.4(a)) in Customer\u2019s discretion), or (ii) negotiate with Customer in good faith a discount to the fees for the Services relating to the Translated Works which were the subject of a Rejection.\nWith respect to a Rejection resulting solely from a delay in delivery, the maximum discount that Smartcat may offer will be capped at 15%.<br> (d) Smartcat\u2019s obligations under subsection (c) comprise Customer\u2019s sole and exclusive remedy and Smartcat\u2019s sole obligation and liability for a Rejection of Translated Works by Customer for any reason.\n</p>\n<p> 1.4 <b>Suppliers.</b>\n<br>\n<br> (a) Smartcat in each case will engage the services of such subcontractors as Smartcat deems necessary to perform the Services required by this Agreement (\u201cSuppliers\u201d).<br> (b) Smartcat shall be wholly responsible for payment to the Suppliers of their fees in connection with performing the Services.\nIn no event shall Suppliers be considered employees of Customer.<br> (c) Customer may request that Smartcat either (i) use, replace or assign additional Suppliers to a Service Task or (ii) not use or remove specific Suppliers from a Service Task, and Smartcat will use reasonable commercial efforts to accommodate Customer requests.<br> (d) Customer may invite Suppliers to register on the Platform via an invitation link.\nSmartcat does not provide any additional services to such Suppliers (including, but not limited to, listing Supplier\u2019s profile on the Platform search) except those services that are required to establish and maintain efficient collaboration and delivery of the results of the Service Task.\nThe Customer may not invite Suppliers who are the Customer\u2019s employees.<br> (e) Customer agrees, during the term of this Agreement and for three (3) years thereafter, not to solicit any Suppliers (except for Suppliers invited by the Customer as per par.1.4(d) above) for employment or consulting, directly or indirectly, for Customer or for any business or organization in which Customer, or any of the beneficial owners of Customer, if Customer is a legal entity, has an ownership interest of any kind.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, Suppliers are considered to be invited by Customer if: (i) such Supplier\u2019s account was not viewed on the Platform by Customer prior to invitation (ii) the Supplier\u2019s account on the Platform was registered by the invitation link generated from Customer\u2019s account with the Platform.<br>\n</p>\n<p> 1.5 <b>Delays.</b> In the event of (a) a delay by Customer in delivering Customer Materials or responding to questions relating to Customer Materials, (b) a delay due to Customer\u2019s request for changes to Customer Materials or any other terms of the applicable Service Task, (c) a dispute in good faith between the parties as to whether Translated Works meet the requirements specified in the applicable Service Task, (d) a delay due to any third party\u2019s act, failure to act or delay in performing any obligation whatsoever, other than the act, failure to act or delay by a Supplier, or (e) any other delay incurred as a result of Customer\u2019s actions, the delivery schedule set forth in the Service Task shall be deemed postponed for an equivalent period.\nNo such delay shall relieve or suspend Customer\u2019s obligation to pay Smartcat under Section 2 hereof and, in addition to such payment obligations, Customer shall pay for all reasonable expenses incurred by Smartcat in connection with any such delay.\nIn the event of delay due to the act, failure to act or delay in performing obligations by one or more Suppliers, Customer\u2019s sole recourse shall be to request that such Suppliers shall be replaced and Smartcat\u2019s duties shall be considered met upon so replacing the Suppliers, as applicable.\n</p> 2.\nPAYMENT TERMS Back to
