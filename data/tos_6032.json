800-352-5267.\nPayment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by the JAMS rules, including JAMS\u2019 Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards.\nA party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to JAMS and give notice to the other party as specified in the JAMS Rules.</p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or

warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nTo the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.\nThe parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in
