confirmation of your registration.&nbsp;This confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with external e-mail addresses.&nbsp;The registration for the newsletter will be logged in order to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements.&nbsp;This includes the storage of the login and the confirmation time, as well as the IP address.&nbsp;Likewise, changes to your data stored with the shipping service provider will be logged.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Credentials: To subscribe to the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your e-mail address.&nbsp;Optionally, we ask you to give a name in the newsletter for personal address.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>The dispatch of the newsletter and the associated performance measurement are based on the consent of the recipients acc.&nbsp;Art.\n6 para.\n1 lit.&nbsp;a, Art.\n7 DSGVO in connection with \u00a7 7 Abs.\n2 Nr.\n3 UWG or if consent is not required based on our legitimate interests in direct marketing acc.&nbsp;Art.\n6 para.\n1 lt.\nF.&nbsp;DSGVO in connection with \u00a7 7 Abs.\n3 UWG.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>The logging of the registration process is based on our legitimate interests in accordance with.&nbsp;Art.\n6 para.\n1 lit.&nbsp;f DSGVO.&nbsp;Our interest lies in the use of a user-friendly and secure newsletter system, which serves both our business interests and the expectations of the users and also allows us to prove our consent.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Termination / Revocation - You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, ie revoke your consent.&nbsp;A link to cancel the newsletter can be found at the end of each newsletter.&nbsp;We may save the submitted email addresses for up to three years based on our legitimate interests before we delete them to provide prior consent.&nbsp;The processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims.&nbsp;An individual request for cancellation is possible at any time, provided that at the same time the former existence of a consent is confirmed.</p>\nNewsletter - Success Measurement\n<p>The newsletters contain a so-called \"web-beacon\", ie a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the server when the newsletter is opened by our server or, if we use a shipping service provider.&nbsp;This call will initially collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>This information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on their specifications or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times.&nbsp;Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters are opened, when they are opened, and which links are clicked.&nbsp;For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients.&nbsp;However, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the shipping service provider to observe individual users.&nbsp;The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>A separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case, the entire newsletter subscription must be terminated.</p>\nHosting and e-mailing\n<p>The Hosting Services we provide are designed to provide the following services: infrastructure and platform services, computing

our legitimate interests (ie interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online service within the meaning of Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nDSGVO) , USA, (\"Google\").&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, which provides a guarantee to comply with European privacy legislation (https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;status=Active).&nbsp;<br>\n<br>We use Google's online AdWords marketing tool \"AdWords\" to place ads on the Google advertising network (eg, in search results, in videos, on websites, etc.) so that they are shown to users who have a suspected interest in the ads.&nbsp;This allows us to more specifically display ads for and within our online offering so that we only present ads to users that potentially match their interests.&nbsp;For example, if a user sees ads for products he's been looking for on other online offerings, that's called remarketing.&nbsp;For these purposes, upon access to our and other websites where the Google Advertising Network is active, Google will immediately execute a Google code and become so-called (re) marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as \").\" Web beacons \") incorporated into the website.&nbsp;With their help, the user can store an individual cookie, ie a small file (instead of cookies, comparable technologies can also be used).&nbsp;In this file is noted which websites the user visited, for what content he is interested and what offers the user has clicked, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visit time and other information on the use of the online offer.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Furthermore, we receive an individual \"conversion cookie\".&nbsp;The information obtained through the cookie is used by Google to generate conversion statistics for us.&nbsp;However, we only hear the anonymous total number of users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page.&nbsp;However, we do not receive any information that personally identifies users.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>The data of the users are pseudonym processed within the Google advertising network.&nbsp;For example, Google does not store and process users' names or e-mail addresses, but processes the relevant data in a cookie-related manner within pseudonymous user profiles.&nbsp;That is, from the perspective of Google, the ads are not managed and displayed to a specifically identified person, but to the cookie owner, regardless of who that cookie owner is.&nbsp;This does not apply if a user has explicitly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization.&nbsp;The information collected about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the United States.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>For more information about Google's data usage, hiring and disparaging options, please read Google's

\"content\").&nbsp;<br>\n<br>This always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address.&nbsp;The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content.&nbsp;We endeavor to use only content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content.&nbsp;Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also referred to as \"web beacons\") for statistical or marketing purposes.&nbsp;The \"pixel tags\" can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website.&nbsp;The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may include, but is
