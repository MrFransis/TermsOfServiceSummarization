email us at&nbsp;help@myprivacyrequest.com.&nbsp.\nTo prevent an unauthorized third party from accessing or making decisions regarding a user\u2019s Information, we verify all requests to exercise these rights (a verifiable consumer request).\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or abusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In general, we will verify a request by matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the Information we already have for the user.&nbsp.\nIf we cannot verify the user using the foregoing method, we may request additional information which we will not retain or use for any other purpose.&nbsp;<br>For all verifiable consumer requests, we strive to respond within forty-five (45) days of receipt.&nbsp.\nIf we require additional time, which can be up to ninety (90) days in the aggregate, we will provide written notice.&nbsp.\nAny disclosures we provide will cover only the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt and will be delivered electronically in a secure fashion.&nbsp.\nIf, for some reason, we cannot fulfill or comply with your request, our response will explain that decision.&nbsp;<br>Disclosure of Information Collected and Sold.&nbsp.\nWhile users have the right to request different levels of disclosure regarding the collection,

agreements with third parties to whom we sell or disclose Information prohibit the further sale or use beyond the scope of our agreement with them, if a California user opts-out, we will notify all third parties to whom we have sold or disclosed the California user\u2019s Information within the previous 90 days and remind them not to further sell the Information.&nbsp.\nWe will not ask a California user who has opted out to re-opt-in for one year after the California user opts-out.&nbsp.\nIf the user requests a transaction with us that requires the sale of their Information, we will

minimum recovery of Five Hundred Dollars\n($500.00), plus we will reimburse any reasonable expenses incurred by your\nattorney, if any, including fees reasonably accrued for investigating,\npreparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration.&nbsp.\nAlthough under some laws\nwe may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail\nin arbitration, we agree that we will not seek

waiver of any of your rights\nand remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in\nbinding arbitration as provided above.&nbsp.\nThis provision preventing you from\nbringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent\nagreement.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Exceptions to Mandatory Arbitration.&nbsp.\n</b>There are two narrow exceptions to mandatory
