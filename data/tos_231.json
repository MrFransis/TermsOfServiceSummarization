the important things you need to know about accessing and using the <strong>JoinDiaspora*</strong> (https://joindiaspora.com/) website and service (collectively, \"Service\").\nThese are our terms of service (\"Terms\").\nPlease read them carefully.\n</p> Accepting these Terms <p>\nIf you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all of the terms below.\nSo, before you use the Service, please read all of the terms.\nIf you don't agree to all of the terms below, please do not use the Service.\nAlso, if a term does not make sense to you, please let us know by e-mailing incoming+feneas-association-8-issue-@git.feneas.org.\n</p> Changes to these Terms <p>\nWe reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time.\nFor instance, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or for some other reason.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective six (6) weeks after we post such revised Terms to our website (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms), or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button).\nIt is your responsibility to check the website regularly for changes to these Terms.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then you have accepted the revised Terms.\n</p> Privacy Policy <p>\nFor information about how we collect and use information about users of the Service, please check out our privacy policy.\n</p> Third-Party Services <p>\nFrom time to time, we may provide you with links to third party websites or services that we do not own or control.\nYour use of the Service may also include the use of applications that are developed or owned by a third party.\nYour use of such third party applications, websites, and services is governed by that party\u2019s own terms of service or privacy policies.\nWe encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third party application, website or service that you visit or use.\nNote that while <strong>JoinDiaspora*</strong> itself does not work directly with advertisers, third party applications may contain advertising or marketing materials provided by such third parties.\n</p> Creating Accounts <p>\nWhen you create an account, you may use any name (real, fake or otherwise) for other users to see.\nHowever, if you create a \"parody\" account of a real living person, you must clearly label your account as such.\nAccounts that are not clearly marked as such and that impersonate other people without permission can be deleted without warning.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you create an account you also agree to maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to your account data and any other information you provide to <strong>JoinDiaspora*</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you discover or suspect any Service security breaches, please let us know as soon as possible.\nFor security holes in the diaspora* software itself,

intended.\n</p>\n<p>\nAside from our limited right to your content, you retain all of your rights to the content you post, link and otherwise make available on or through the Service.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou can remove the content that you posted by deleting it.\nOnce you delete your content, it will not appear on the Service, but copies of your deleted content may remain in our system or backups for some period of time.\nWeb server access logs might also be stored for some time in the system.\n</p>\n<p>\nSince diaspora* is a distributed social network, it is possible, depending on the visibility rules set to your content, that your content has been distributed to other diaspora* pods.\nWhen you delete your content, we will request those other pods to also delete the content.\nOur responsibility on the content being deleted from those other pods ends here.\nIf for some reason, some other pod does not delete the content, we cannot be held responsible.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn order to make
