translation</strong>\n<br>\nTerms of Use: <strong>Portuguese translation</strong>\n</p>\n<br>\nIntroduction <p>Thank you for using web-based services and related apps and technologies provided by Cengage Learning, Inc.\nand its affiliates (\u201cCengage\u201d).\n&nbsp;The term \u201cServices\u201d as used in these Cengage Terms of Use (\u201cTerms\u201d) refers to the products, services, websites, content, databases, software, technologies, and tools delivered by Cengage and that link or otherwise refer to these Terms, or that are delivered through a website or service that links or refers to these Terms.\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nCengage is willing to provide the Services to you only on the condition that you first accept these Terms.\n&nbsp;By accessing, registering for, or using any Service, or by accepting these Terms through an \u201cI Accept\u201d check-box or similar method, you agree to these Terms.\n&nbsp;You may also agree to these Terms by physically or electronically signing an Order (as defined below) that incorporates these Terms.\n&nbsp;These Terms along with any Order form a legally binding agreement between you and Cengage.<br>\n<br>\nPlease read these Terms carefully and, if you wish, print or save a copy for your records.\nIf you do not agree with these Terms, you may not access or use the Services.<br>\n<br>\nYour use of certain Services may be subject to additional terms, which may be presented to you for acceptance when you sign up for those Services or may otherwise be accessible through the Services (\u201cSupplemental Terms\u201d).\nSuch Supplemental Terms will be considered part of these Terms.\n&nbsp;In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will control with respect to your use or access of the Services associated with such Supplemental Terms.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Please note:</strong> some Services may be used only in conjunction with an active educational course offering in which you are enrolled or are administering.\nThis requirement may be specified in an online description of these Services, or in the applicable Supplemental Terms.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<em>If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another organization or entity, you represent that you are duly authorized to bind that organization or entity to these Terms.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Minors</strong>\n<br>\nIf you are entering into these Terms on your own behalf, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.\nIf you are under 18 years of age, your parent or guardian must enter into these Terms on your behalf, and this parent or guardian represents that he or she accepts these Terms on your behalf and that you are 13 or older.\nYou are not allowed to use the Services if you are under the age of 13.\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Orders</strong>\n<br>\nYou may gain access to the Services through your acceptance of an online or printed order form or other ordering document that references these Terms, including access through an access code or card (an \u201cOrder\u201d).\n&nbsp;An Order may specify applicable fees, how long you are authorized to use the Service, and other terms.\n&nbsp;In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the terms of an Order (excluding these Terms), these Terms shall control except only to the extent that the Order identifies the specific provision(s) in these Terms to be varied.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Changes to the Services</strong>\n<br>\nCengage may, with or without notice, add features to the Services, or change or remove features of the Services, at any time.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Your Account</strong>\n<br>\nTo use a Service, you will need a Cengage username and password, unless you log in through a \u201csingle sign-on\u201d system using your learning management system username and password if the Service includes this feature.\nCertain Services may also require additional login information.<br>\n<br>\nYour account is for your personal use only.\nYou may not authorize others to use your account, and you may not assign or transfer your account.<br>\n<br>\nYou must keep your username and password confidential.\n&nbsp;You are responsible for all activities, charges, and liabilities associated with your account.\nYou agree to immediately notify Cengage of any unauthorized use of your account of which you are aware.\nIf you are a minor, Cengage reserves the right to provide access to your account to your parent, guardian, or other authorized adult, upon such adult\u2019s request.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Institution Subscription</strong>\n<br>\nThis Section applies only if an applicable Order specifies that you are acquiring a Service subscription for an institution.\n&nbsp;Also, if your institution and Cengage have a separate signed agreement, then such agreement will control if there is a conflict between the terms of such agreement and the terms of this Section.\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nSubject to your payment of the applicable fees and taxes, you may authorize your students, faculty, and administrative staff (collectively, \u201cAuthorized Users\u201d) to access and use the applicable Service for non-commercial educational or instructional use, on condition that those Authorized Users accept these Terms before or during their first use of that Service.\nFor Service subscriptions that include a limit on the number of Authorized Users, Authorized Users includes all individuals authorized to use the Service, regardless of whether any such individual is actively using that Service at a particular time.\nYou shall ensure that Authorized Users and any other person that uses the Service through the use of your password and account comply with these Terms.\nYou shall take all reasonable precautions necessary to safeguard against unauthorized access and use of the Service through your password and account, including ensuring that an Authorized User ceases use of the Service after that Authorized User is no longer associated with your institution.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Your Use of the Services</strong>\n<br>\nDuring the applicable term of your subscription for use of the Services if specified in an Order, Cengage grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license only to access and to use the Services for the Permitted Use (as defined below), subject to your compliance with these Terms.\nYou may not use the Services for any other purpose, or after the end of the applicable term, or after termination of your rights to use the Services under these Terms.<br>\n<br>\n\u201cPermitted Use\u201d means your personal noncommercial purposes, or, only if the Order expressly specifies, your noncommercial educational or instructional purposes.<br>\n<br>\nYou shall provide, at your own expense, suitable equipment, software, and internet access as necessary to access and use the Services.<br>\n<br>\nNeither the Services nor any portion thereof may be displayed, copied, downloaded, sold, resold, used, distributed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without Cengage\u2019s prior written consent.\nYou may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any Mark (defined below) or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout and form) of Cengage or its licensors without Cengage\u2019s prior written consent.\nYou may not use any meta tags or any other \"hidden text\" using Cengage's Marks without Cengage\u2019s prior written consent.\nAny unauthorized use by you of Cengage\u2019s Marks or other intellectual property automatically terminates the license granted by Cengage under these Terms and your right to use the Services.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Content</strong>\n<br>\nThe Services may allow you to upload or otherwise add through the Services information, text, graphics, photos, audio, video, and/or other materials and content (\u201cContent\u201d).\n&nbsp;You represent and warrant that you own or have the full right to provide all Content that you provide through the Services for use with the Services (\u201cYour Content\u201d), and that Your Content does not infringe any third-party rights, including any intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights.<br>\n<br>\nCengage does not obtain ownership of Your Content.\n&nbsp;You hereby grant Cengage a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, perform, and display Your Content in connection with the Services and Cengage\u2019s business, including for promoting the Services, in all media now known or hereafter devised, and through any media channels.\n&nbsp;In the event that perpetual license terms are not allowed by law, the term shall be for the longest period allowed by applicable law.<br>\n<br>\nCengage does not adopt, endorse, or accept responsibility for Your Content or any third-party Content.\nYou agree that Cengage will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from your reliance on Your Content or any third-party Content available through the Services.<br>\n<br>\nCengage reserves the right (but has no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse, or remove Content from the Services.<br>\n<br>\nAfter termination of your use of any Services, except as required by applicable law, Cengage does not have any obligation to destroy, return or retain Your Content relating to your use of such Services.\n&nbsp;It is your sole responsibility to backup and export Your Content prior to termination.<br>\n<br>\nCengage and its licensors own and retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, all underlying technology used with or otherwise enabling the Services, and all software and Content (other than Your Content, which you own subject to the license set forth herein) available within the Services (collectively, \u201cCengage Materials\u201d), including all associated trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights.\nNothing in these Terms transfers any such rights, title, or interest to you or any other user, and Cengage reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.\nAll software and apps provided to you under these Terms are licensed, not sold.<br>\n<br>\nYou agree not to remove, conceal, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) contained within the Cengage Materials.\nYou may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) extract, copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to access or use the source code of the software underlying or otherwise used to provide the Services or any part thereof, except to the extent allowed by law notwithstanding this restriction.<br>\n<br>\nAll trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, and graphics included within the Services (\"Marks\") are trademarks of Cengage and its licensors.\nYou may not use any Marks without the prior written consent of Cengage.<br>\n<br>\nYou agree that any breach of your obligations with respect to Cengage's and its licensors\u2019 proprietary or intellectual property rights will result in irreparable injury to Cengage and its licensors for which money damages are inadequate, and you therefore agree that Cengage and its licensors shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to address such breach, without the requirement of posting a bond, in addition to any other relief that a court may deem proper.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Modifiable Cengage Content</strong>\n<br>\nCertain Services may contain some Cengage Materials that are presented to you in a modifiable format, where your modification of the Cengage Materials is expressly and clearly permitted (\u201cModifiable Cengage Content\u201d).\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nSubject to your compliance with these Terms and any use restrictions specified in the applicable Order, and during the term of the applicable Services, you may: (1) modify and create derivative works of Modifiable Cengage Content, (2) reformat and print copies of Modifiable Cengage Content (including your modifications and derivative works of Modifiable Cengage Content) when the capability to reformat and/or print that Modifiable Cengage Content is made available through the Services, and (3) use Modifiable Cengage Content (including your modifications and derivative works of Modifiable Cengage Content) solely for the Permitted Use.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Shared Content</strong>\n<br>\nCertain Services may contain Content posted by Cengage and other users (including Your Content) in an area of an applicable Service that is designated as a learning space and/or user community and that is presented to users in a modifiable format and in a manner clearly indicating that modification and distribution for the Permitted Use is permitted (\u201cShared Content\u201d).<br>\n<br>\nSubject to your compliance with these Terms and any use restrictions specified in the applicable Order, and during the term of the applicable Services, you may: (1) modify and create derivative works of the Shared Content, and (2) copy, distribute, display, perform, and otherwise use those modifications, derivative works, and Shared Content, by means of any media or delivery technology now known or hereafter devised, solely for the Permitted Use.\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Open Content</strong>\n<br>\nCertain Services may contain Content made available through a Creative Commons license (such as Attribution 4.0 International) or similar \u201copen\u201d-style license (\u201cOpen License\u201d), as clearly and expressly specified within the Services (\u201cOpen Content\u201d).\n&nbsp.\nYou will have the rights to use Open Content solely as specified in the associated Open License.\n&nbsp;Nothing in these Terms shall restrict your rights under any Open License to Open Content provided through the Services.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Your Modifications to Content</strong>\n<br>\nIf you make any modifications to or derivative works of Modifiable Cengage Content, Shared Content, or Open Content, then all such modifications and derivative works shall be considered part of Your Content and are subject to the license and other provisions in the Section entitled \u201cContent\u201d above, as well as all other applicable provisions of these Terms.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Instructor Use</strong>\n<br>\nIf you are a teacher or instructor, you may incorporate Cengage Content (including your modifications and derivative works of Modifiable Cengage Content) in: (1) in-class handouts (provided without charge and limited in the number of copies), (2) online classrooms or courses (so long as access to the Cengage Content is limited to matriculated students enrolled in your class who are required to accept these Terms and enter a unique passcode or other verifiable industry-standard authentication system that ensures each user is individually identified before such access), (3) in-class displays (e.g., via projector, computer monitor or television screen), (4) class outlines or lessons, and (5) non-fee based exams, in each case associated with a course of study (i.e., a class) for which the e-book included in the Service as specified in an Order has been adopted and is concurrently being used.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Storage of Your Content</strong>\n<br>\nYou acknowledge that the Services are not designed or intended to be used as part of a disaster recovery facility or an emergency data storage facility.\nAlthough Cengage takes reasonable precautions to preserve and protect Your Content, you shall not rely on the Services as your only storage means.\nYou should make and preserve your own backup copies of Your Content.\nCengage is not liable for damage to, deletion of, or failure to store, Your Content.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Fees</strong>\n<br>\nSome Services and associated Content may be available only if an associated fee has been paid.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, all fees are payable in U.S.\ndollars.\n&nbsp;All fees paid are nonrefundable and non-creditable.<br>\n<br>\nUnless another form of payment is specified in the Order, Cengage will bill your credit card (for purposes of these Terms, the term \u201ccredit card\u201d includes a credit card or a debit card) for all applicable fees in advance of Service delivery.\nYou shall provide Cengage with accurate and complete billing information, including your name, address, telephone number, and valid credit card information, and shall promptly notify Cengage of any changes in that information.\nYou acknowledge that the agreement between you and the applicable credit card issuer governs use of your credit card for payment of amounts owed to Cengage, including your rights and obligations as a holder of that card.<br>\n<br>\nCengage will disclose the applicable payment options at the time you place your Order.\nYou shall select a payment method to pay Cengage for purchases you make for and/or from the applicable Services.\nCengage or Cengage's billing agent may charge your payment method for all amounts due to Cengage without additional notice or consent unless otherwise required by law.\nCengage may, in its discretion: (1) post charges to your payment method individually, or (2) aggregate your charges with other purchases you make within the Services and apply those charges to your next billing cycle.<br>\n<br>\nExcept for taxes based on Cengage\u2019s net income, if any authority imposes a tax, duty, levy, or fee upon your use of or orders for any Services, you shall pay that amount as specified in the Order or Cengage\u2019s invoice or supply Cengage with exemption documentation.\n&nbsp;You are also responsible for paying all administrative fees (such as PayPal fees) associated with the Services and any transactions you entered into in connection with the Services.<br>\n<br>\nIf Cengage does not receive payment from your credit card issuer, upon demand you shall pay all overdue amounts by other means acceptable to Cengage.\nCengage may accept other forms of payment, and if Cengage invoices you for Services, you shall pay to Cengage the amount indicated in each invoice by the due date reflected on the invoice.<br>\n<br>\nIf you believe that a billing discrepancy has occurred, unless you notify Cengage in writing within 60 days after the date on which that discrepancy first appeared on your credit card account statement or invoice, as applicable, you waive your right to claim that discrepancy.<br>\n<br>\nService purchases and subscriptions are nonreturnable and cannot be exchanged.\nUntil your Service is terminated, you will continue to accrue charges for which you remain liable, even if you do not use the Service.<br>\n<br>\nIf you fail to pay according to these Terms, Cengage may, without prejudice to its other rights and remedies: (1) charge interest on any unpaid amounts on a daily basis from the original due date at the rate of the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount permissible by law, (2) suspend or terminate your use and/or access to Services, or both (1) and (2).\nYou shall reimburse Cengage for all reasonable expenses Cengage incurs in collecting past due amounts, including wire transfer fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and court costs.\nCengage may charge a fee for reinstatement of suspended or terminated accounts.<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, if you fail to pay according to these Terms, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, you consent and agree that Cengage or its designated third party collection agency may contact you by: (1) phone at one or more of your telephone numbers, including your wireless telephone numbers (in which case you might incur wireless telephone charges under your wireless device plan), (2) text messages (in which case you might incur message and data charges under your wireless device plan) or emails, and/or (3) any other method of contact, including pre-recorded and/or artificial voice messages or an automatic dialing device.\nCengage may from time to time offer Service promotions and discounts for which you may be eligible, including promotions available for a limited time.\nUnless otherwise specifically noted, Service promotional offers and discounts apply to first-time purchasers only.\n&nbsp;Separate terms and conditions may apply to promotional offers and discounts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General Practices and Acceptable Use of the Services</strong>\n<br>\nCengage may establish general practices and limits applicable to your use of the Services, including the maximum number of days that Your Content is retained in connection with the applicable Service, the maximum storage space allotted on your behalf for such Service, and the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration for which) you are

period allows you to keep the textbook for 137 days if necessary at no extra cost).</li>\n<li>Semester (130 days).\nThis rental period is designed for students attending full semesters.\nThe rental period begins on the date of your Order and ends at midnight at the end of the 130th day after the date of your Order, both dates inclusive (\"Semester Due Date\"), and your return must be received by

Account\" portion of the Service) will automatically be extended by the number of days selected.<br>\n<br>\nYou may purchase your rented textbook in accordance with the purchase process explained in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section of the Service at any time after its 30-day cancellation period but before its Due Date.\nYour purchase price will be the difference between the textbook's

hinders the readability of the textbook or that Cengage reasonably deems excessive is not allowed.</li>\n<li>Cengage may charge you a damage fee if you do not return your textbook with all of the supplemental materials (including, as applicable, CDs, DVDs, access codes, inserts, workbooks, and study guides) that were provided with the textbook.</li>\n<li>If your rented textbook is returned damaged beyond reasonable wear and tear (for example, cover ripped off, pages torn out, excessive water damage), Cengage may charge you a damage fee equal to the difference between the textbook's list price and the total sum of rental fees (including rental extension fees) already paid by you.</li>\n<li>You shall package returned textbooks appropriately (for example, bubble wrapped) to keep them from being damaged during shipping.\nIf your rented textbook is returned to Cengage as damaged, you will be liable for such damage, and the textbook will remain the property of Cengage

request must (i) include the dates and times of each incident of Downtime in the preceding month.\nand (ii) be received by Cengage within 30 days after the end of the billing cycle in which the Downtime occurred.<br>\n<br>\nUpon receipt of a Service Credit request in compliance with the above requirements, Cengage shall have 30 days to review the request and to validate the information provided.\nIf Cengage determines in good faith that the PathBrite Service failed to meet the Uptime Commitment as alleged in such a request, then Cengage will apply the Service Credit to your account

same edition of such materials is being used).<br>\n<br>\nThe WebAssign Service may be used only in conjunction with an educational course offering in which you are enrolled or which you are teaching or administering, as applicable.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>WebAssign IDs</strong>\n<br>\nStudent usernames and passwords may be provided to WebAssign for use with the WebAssign Service by the instructor (or, if the instructor chooses and if available, by self-enrollment functionality).\n&nbsp;WebAssign determines any applicable institution code.\nYou should change your password before starting to use the WebAssign Service, to prevent unauthorized access to your assignments.\nTo facilitate communication between WebAssign and users of the WebAssign Service, and for retrieval of login information, we use email addresses.<br>\n<br>\nIf your WebAssign Services account has been set up by your instructor or other administrator, your instructor or administrator may be able to access or disable your

in this Section.<br>\n<br>\nSubject to the early termination provisions set forth below, lifetime subscribers will be provided at least 5 years (60 months) of access to Questia.\nHowever, in the event Questia discontinues the service or ceases to do business, or in the event of an acquisition of Questia, change of control of Questia, significant merger, or other legal reorganization, Questia may terminate lifetime subscriptions by returning your purchase price less an amount computed by multiplying your purchase price by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of complete months since your purchase of the lifetime subscription and the denominator of which is 60.\nQuestia has the right to terminate your account if you violate the Cengage Terms of Use, including these Supplemental Terms.\nIf Questia terminates your account because of a violation of the Cengage Terms of Use, including these Supplemental Terms, Questia will not refund any portion of your subscription price.\nQuestia may introduce additional Services from time to time, which may be excluded from an existing lifetime subscription without additional cost.<br>\n<br>\nIf your Questia lifetime

which point we will delete your data.\nActivity is defined as a login to the Questia service.<br>\n<br>\nYou can cancel your lifetime subscription upon notice to Questia.\nhowever, cancellation of a
