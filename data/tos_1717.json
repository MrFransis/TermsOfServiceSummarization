this Agreement.\nEach party expressly agrees that this Agreement is legally binding upon it.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nOverview.</strong> The Moovweb Service is designed to enable Customer to deploy, manage and optimize its websites as Projects through a single platform that integrates with Customer\u2019s back-end systems and Third-Party Platforms.\nCustomer

the Service.\nEach User must keep its login credentials confidential and not share them with anyone else.\nCustomer is responsible for its Users\u2019 compliance with this Agreement and actions taken through their accounts (excluding misuse of accounts caused by Moovweb\u2019s breach of this Agreement).\nCustomer will promptly notify Moovweb if it becomes aware of any compromise of its User login credentials.\nMoovweb uses User account information as described in its Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3.</strong>&nbsp.\n<em>Restrictions</em>.\nCustomer will not (and will not permit anyone

parties, (c) use the Service to develop a similar or competing product or service, (d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or seek to access the source code or non-public APIs to the Service,

authorized copies of the Developer Tools), (f) remove or obscure any proprietary notices in the Service, (g) publish benchmarks or performance information about the Service, (h) transmit any viruses

to copy and transmit Collected Data but only as necessary to provide the Products to Customer under this Agreement.\nCustomer acknowledges and agrees that Moovweb is acting solely as a passive conduit to transmit Collected Data to Customer and that the Service is not designed (and Moovweb has no responsibility) for any caching or storage of Collected Data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.3.</strong>&nbsp.\n<em>Security</em>.\nMoovweb uses reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the Service and Customer Data as described in the

Assets</strong>.\nCustomer grants Moovweb the non-exclusive, worldwide right to use, copy, store, transmit, distribute, adapt, modify, translate, publicly perform and display, and create derivative works of any Customer Assets provided to Moovweb solely for purposes of providing the Products to Customer under this Agreement.\nAs between the parties, Customer will be solely responsible for compliance with any third-party license or other terms and conditions of use for Customer Assets (including for Third-Party Platforms as further described in Section 9 (Third-Party Platforms).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nCustomer Obligations.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.1.&nbsp.\n</strong>\n<em>Compliance</em>.\nCustomer is responsible for its Customer Data and Customer Assets, including their content and accuracy, and agrees to comply with Laws and the AUP in using the Service.\nCustomer represents and warrants that (a) it has made all disclosures and has all rights, consents and permissions necessary to use its Customer Data and Customer Assets with the Service and grant Moovweb the rights in Sections 4.1 (Service Data Use), 4.2 (Collected Data Use) and 5 (Customer Assets), (b) the Customer Data and Customer Assets (and their use contemplated in this Agreement, including Customer\u2019s collection and use of Collected Data) will not violate or infringe Laws, third-party rights (including intellectual property, publicity or privacy rights) or any terms or privacy policies that apply to the Customer Data or the Customer Assets, and (c) there are no pending or threatened claims pertaining to Customer Data or Customer Assets that could impact Customer or Moovweb under this Agreement (and Customer will promptly notify Moovweb in event of such a claim).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2.&nbsp.\n</strong>\n<em>Prohibited Uses</em>.\nCustomer must not use the Service with Prohibited Data or for High Risk Activities.\nCustomer acknowledges that the Service is not intended to meet any legal obligations for these uses, including HIPAA requirements, and that Moovweb is not a Business Associate as defined under HIPAA.&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Moovweb has no liability for Prohibited Data or use of the Service for High Risk Activities.\nFurther, the Service is not designed to store or cache Collected Data, and Moovweb will have no responsibility for any Collected Data stored or cached as a result of modifications to or configuration of the Service by Customer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3.&nbsp.\n</strong>\n<em>Configuration Requirements</em>.\nCustomer acknowledges and agrees that successful implementation and display of Projects is dependent upon the availability of Customer Assets and proper configuration of any Projects in accordance with the Documentation and any other configuration requirements provided to Customer by Moovweb.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Moovweb will have no responsibility or liability: (a) with respect to the availability or uptime of Customer Assets, (b) for any inability to implement or display a Project if the Customer Assets become unavailable to the Service or (c) for maintaining backup copies of Customer Assets.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.4.&nbsp.\n</strong>\n<em>Customer Assets and Third-Party Rights</em>.\nCustomer must promptly address any notices of alleged infringement or violation of third-party rights by Customer Assets, including Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) takedown requests, and must promptly notify Moovweb of any such notices applicable to its use of the Service.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, without limiting Moovweb\u2019s other rights and remedies in this Agreement, Moovweb reserves the right to respond to any DMCA notices it receives by taking any actions necessary to comply with applicable Laws.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5.&nbsp.\n</strong>\n<em>End Users</em>.\nCustomer is solely responsible for all interaction with the Project by its End Users, including obtaining all End User clearances, consents and approvals required by Laws and implementing terms that govern End User interaction with the Project.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nSuspension of Service.</strong> Moovweb may suspend Customer\u2019s access to the Service and related services (a) if Customer breaches Section 2.3 (Restrictions) or Section 6 (Customer Obligations), (b) if Customer\u2019s account is 30 days or more overdue, (c) if Customer\u2019s actions risk harm to other customers or the security, availability or integrity of the Service, (d) for suspected or actual violation of the AUP or (e) as required by Laws, court order or other governmental request.\nMoovweb may also suspend access to the Service or take down Customer Assets in response to notices of alleged infringement.\nWhere practicable, Moovweb will use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior notice of the suspension.\nOnce Customer resolves the issue requiring suspension, Moovweb will promptly restore Customer\u2019s access to the Service in accordance with this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third-Party Platforms</strong>.\nCustomer may choose to use the Service with Third-Party Platforms.\nUse of Third-Party Platforms is subject to Customer\u2019s agreement with the relevant provider and not this Agreement.\nMoovweb does not control and has no liability for Third-Party Platforms, including their security, functionality, operation, availability or interoperability or how the Third-Party Platforms or their providers use Customer Data or Customer Assets.\nIf Customer enables a Third-Party Platform with the Service, Moovweb may access and exchange Customer Data or Customer Assets with the Third-Party Platform on Customer\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Professional Services</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.1.&nbsp.\n</strong>\n<em>Scope</em>.\nAny purchased Professional Services are as described in the relevant Order or SOW.\nCustomer will give Moovweb timely access to Customer Assets reasonably needed for the Professional Services, and if Customer fails to do so, Moovweb\u2019s obligation to provide Professional Services will be excused until access is provided.\nIf Moovweb provides Customer with deliverables as part of Professional Services, Customer may use the deliverables only as part of its authorized use of the Service, subject to the same terms as for the Service in Section 2 (The Service) and Section 6 (Customer Obligations).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.2.&nbsp.\n</strong>\n<em>Implementation Code</em>.\nAs a limited exception to the use rights for Professional Services deliverables in Section 9.1 above and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Moovweb grants to Customer a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, perpetual license to use, reproduce, modify and create derivative works of any Implementation Code solely for its internal business purposes.\nCustomer will not use Implementation Code for any competitive purpose, including to build or provide a competitive product or service to the Service.\nMoovweb will have no obligations with respect to Implementation Code following expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.&nbsp;Commercial Terms</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Subscription Term</em>.\nEach Subscription Term will renew for successive 12-month periods unless either party gives the other party notice of non-renewal at least 90 days before the current Subscription Term ends.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Fees and Taxes</em>.\nFees are as described in each Order or SOW.\nMoovweb will charge Customer for Professional Services at the rates set forth in the applicable Order or SOW (or, if not specified, Moovweb\u2019s then-standard rates).\nCustomer will reimburse Moovweb for reasonable travel and lodging expenses it incurs in providing Professional Services.\nFees are invoiced on the schedule in the Order or SOW and reimbursable expenses are invoiced in arrears.\nUnless the Order or SOW provides otherwise, all fees and expenses are due within 30 days of the invoice date.\nFees for renewal Subscription Terms are at Moovweb\u2019s then-current rates, regardless of any discounted pricing in a prior Order.\nLate payments are subject to a service charge of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount allowed by Law, whichever is less.\nAll fees and expenses are non-refundable except as set out in Section 11.2 (Warranty Remedy), Section 15.4 (Mitigation and Exceptions) and the SLA.\nCustomer is responsible for any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding or similar taxes or levies that apply to its Orders, whether domestic or foreign (\u201cTaxes\u201d), other than Moovweb\u2019s income tax.\nFees and expenses are exclusive of Taxes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Affiliate Orders</em>.\nAn Affiliate of Customer may enter its own Order(s) as mutually agreed with Moovweb.\nThis creates a separate agreement between the Affiliate and Moovweb incorporating this Agreement with the Affiliate treated as \u201cCustomer\u201d.\nNeither Customer nor any Customer Affiliate has any rights under each other\u2019s agreement with Moovweb, and breach or termination of any such agreement is not breach or termination under any other.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warranties and Disclaimers.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Limited Warranty</em>.\nMoovweb warrants to Customer that:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Service will perform materially as described in the Documentation (the \u201c<strong>Performance Warranty</strong>\u201d) and</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moovweb will perform any Professional Services in a professional and workmanlike manner and in substantial conformity with the specifications set forth in the applicable SOW (the \u201c<strong>Professional Services Warranty</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.\n</strong>\n<em>Warranty Remedy.\n</em>If Moovweb breaches Section 11.1 (Limited Warranty) and Customer makes a reasonably detailed warranty claim within 30 days of discovering the issue, then Moovweb will use reasonable efforts to correct the non-conformity.\nIf Moovweb determines such remedy to be impracticable, either party may terminate the affected Order as relates to the non-conforming Service or Professional Services.\nMoovweb will then refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term (for the Performance Warranty) or for the non-conforming Professional Services (for the Professional Services Warranty).\nThese procedures are Customer\u2019s exclusive remedy and Moovweb\u2019s entire liability for breach of the warranties in Section 11.1.These warranties do not apply to (a) issues caused by misuse or unauthorized modifications, (b) issues in or caused by Third-Party Platforms or other third-party systems or (c) Trials and Betas or other free or evaluation use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Disclaimers</em>.\n<strong>Except as expressly provided in Section 11.1 (Limited Warranty), the Products are provided \u201cAS IS\u201d</strong>.<strong> Moovweb and its suppliers make no other warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title or non-infringement</strong>.\n<strong>Without limiting its express obligations in Section 3 (SLA and Support), Moovweb does not warrant that Customer\u2019s use of the Service or display of Projects will be uninterrupted or error-free, that Moovweb will review Customer Data for accuracy or that it will maintain Customer Data without loss, and Moovweb expressly disclaims all obligations with respect to storage or caching of Collected Data.\nMoovweb is not liable for delays, failures or problems inherent in use of the Internet and electronic communications or other systems outside Moovweb\u2019s control.\nCustomer may have other statutory rights, but any statutorily required warranties will be limited to the shortest legally permitted period</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Term and Termination</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Term</em>.\nThis Agreement starts on the Effective Date and continues until expiration or termination of all Subscription Terms and SOWs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Termination</em>.\nEither party may terminate this Agreement (including all Orders and SOWs) if the other party (a) fails to cure a material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within 30 days after notice, (b) ceases operation without a successor or (c) seeks protection under a bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors\u2019 arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if such a proceeding is instituted against that party and not dismissed within 60 days.\nMoovweb may terminate this Agreement without notice to Customer if the Service has been suspended under Section 7 (Suspension of Service) and Customer fails to cure the precipitating event to Moovweb\u2019s satisfaction within 15 days after notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Effect of Termination</em>.\nUpon expiration or termination of this Agreement or an Order or SOW, Customer\u2019s access to the Service and Professional Services will cease, other than limited use of the Service to export Customer Data as described in Section 4.5 (Data Export), and Customer must pay any outstanding amounts due for the Service and any Professional Services provided through the termination date or otherwise contractually committed, as applicable.\nUpon expiration or termination of this Agreement, all Orders and SOWs will terminate, and at the disclosing party\u2019s request the receiving party will delete all of the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information (excluding Customer Data, which is addressed in Section 4.5).\nCustomer Data and other Confidential Information may be retained in the receiving party\u2019s standard backups after deletion but will remain subject to this Agreement\u2019s confidentiality restrictions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Survival</em>.\nThese Sections survive

have.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>Ownership</strong>.\nNeither party grants the other any rights or licenses not expressly set out in this Agreement.\nExcept for Moovweb\u2019s use rights in this Agreement, between the parties Customer retains all intellectual property and other rights in Customer Data and Customer Assets provided to Moovweb.\nExcept for Customer\u2019s use rights in this Agreement, Moovweb and its licensors retain all intellectual property and other rights in the Products, Professional Services deliverables (including any Implementation Code) and related Moovweb technology, templates, formats and dashboards, including any modifications or improvements to these items made by Moovweb.\nIf Customer provides Moovweb with feedback or suggestions regarding the Products, Moovweb may use the feedback or suggestions without restriction or obligation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;Limitations of Liability</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<em>Consequential Damages Waiver</em>.<strong> Except for Excluded Claims, neither party (nor its suppliers) will have any

reliance or consequential damages of any kind, even if informed of their possibility in advance</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<em>Liability Cap</em>.<strong> Except for Excluded Claims, each party\u2019s (and its suppliers\u2019) entire liability arising out of or related to this Agreement will not exceed in aggregate the amounts paid or payable by Customer to Moovweb during the prior 12 months under this Agreement</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<em>Excluded Claims</em>.<strong>\n</strong>\u201c<strong>Excluded Claims</strong>\u201d means: (a) Customer\u2019s breach of Sections 2.3 (Restrictions) or 6 (Customer Obligations), (b) either party\u2019s breach of Section 16 (Confidentiality) (but excluding claims relating to Customer Data) or (c) amounts payable to third parties under the indemnifying party\u2019s obligations in Section 15 (Indemnification).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.4.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<em>Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose</em>.\nThe waivers and limitations in this Section 14 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indemnification</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</strong>\n<em>Indemnification by Moovweb</em>.\nMoovweb will defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Service, when used by Customer as authorized in this Agreement, infringes a third party\u2019s U.S.\npatent, copyright, trademark or trade secret, and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer against any damages or costs awarded against Customer (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) or agreed in settlement by Moovweb resulting from the claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Indemnification by Customer</em>.\nCustomer will defend Moovweb from and against any third-party claim to the extent resulting from (a) Customer Data, Customer Assets, or End User access to and use of Projects (including collection of Collected Data in accordance with this Agreement) or (b) Customer\u2019s breach or alleged breach of Section 6 (Customer Obligations), and will indemnify and hold harmless Moovweb against any damages or costs awarded against Moovweb (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) or agreed in settlement by Customer resulting from the claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Procedures</em>.\nThe indemnifying party\u2019s obligations in this Section 15 are subject to receiving (a) prompt notice of the claim, (b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense and settlement of the claim and (c) all reasonably necessary cooperation of the indemnified party, at the indemnifying party\u2019s expense for reasonable out-of-pocket costs.\nThe indemnifying party may not settle any claim without the indemnified party's prior consent if settlement would require the indemnified party to admit fault or take or refrain from taking any action (other than relating to use of any materials licensed by one party to the other in this Agreement).\nThe indemnified party may participate in a claim with its own counsel at its own expense.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.4.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Mitigation and Exceptions</em>.\nIn response to an actual or potential infringement claim, if required by settlement or injunction or as Moovweb determines necessary to avoid material liability, Moovweb may at its option: (a) procure rights for Customer\u2019s continued use of the Service, (b) replace or modify the allegedly infringing portion of the Service to avoid infringement without reducing the Service\u2019s overall functionality or (c) terminate the affected Order and refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.\nMoovweb\u2019s obligations in this Section 15 do not apply (1) to infringement resulting

Tools other than the most recent release, (3) to unauthorized use of the Service, (4) to any action arising as a result of Customer Data or Customer Assets, (5) to any action arising as a result of customizations or modifications to the Service or any Project by Moovweb or any third party that are based on Customer\u2019s specifications, (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions about a claim without Moovweb\u2019s prior consent or (7) to Trials and Betas or other free or evaluation use.\nThis Section 15<strong> sets out Customer\u2019s exclusive remedy and Moovweb\u2019s entire liability regarding infringement of third-party intellectual property rights</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nConfidentiality.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<em>Definition.</em> \u201c<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\u201d means information disclosed to the receiving party under this Agreement that is designated by the disclosing party as proprietary or confidential or that should be reasonably understood to be proprietary or confidential due to its nature and the circumstances of its disclosure.\nMoovweb\u2019s Confidential Information includes the Products and any technical or performance information about the Service.\nCustomer\u2019s Confidential Information includes Customer Data.\nThe terms and conditions of this Agreement constitute Confidential Information of both parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<em>Obligations</em>.\nAs receiving party, each party will (a) hold Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose it to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement, including Section 4.1 (Service Data Use), 4.2 (Collected Data Use) and 21.11 (Open Source) and (b) only use Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement.\nThe receiving party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Moovweb, the subcontractors referenced in Section 21.8), provided it remains responsible for their compliance with this Section 16 and they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section 16.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.3.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<em>Exclusions</em>.\nThese confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that the receiving party can document (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party, (b) it rightfully knew or possessed prior to receipt under this Agreement, (c) it rightfully received from a third party without breach of confidentiality obligations or (d) it independently developed without using the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.4.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<em>Remedies</em>.\nUnauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone are an insufficient remedy.\nEach party may seek appropriate equitable relief, in addition to other available remedies, for breach or threatened breach of this Section
