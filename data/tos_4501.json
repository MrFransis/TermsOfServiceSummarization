Conduct</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Donations:</strong> In order to contribute to a Campaign or to a Charity, a Donor will be required to provide Do Good Points information regarding its credit card or other payment instrument (\u201cPayment Instrument\u201d) that is linked to the Donor\u2019s account on the Services (a \u201cBilling Account\u201d).\nYou, as a Donor, represent and warrant to Do Good Points that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the applicable Payment Instrument.\nYou agree that a certain minimum Donation amount may apply, and that all Donations are final and will not be refunded unless Do Good Points, in its sole discretion, agrees to issue a refund, for example in accordance with the Do Good Points Refund Policy.\nDo Good Points uses third-party payment processing partners to bill you through your Payment Instrument and Billing Account for any Donations made, and Donors acknowledge that by contributing a Donation to a Campaign, the Donor agrees to the processing, use, transfer or disclosure of data by our Payment Processors pursuant to any and all applicable terms set forth by our payment partners (currently, Stripe, Inc., and Givinga Inc.\nDBA Givinga Foundation), in addition to these Terms of Service, including Stripe\u2019s terms of service, and Givinga Fund\u2019s terms of service.</p>\n<p>Recurring Donations: Donors may have the option to contribute recurring period Donations (your agreement to make the Donations on a recurring basis, a \u201cDonation Subscription\u201d and each individual Donation made in connection with a Donation Subscription, a \u201cDonation Installment\u201d), and in electing to contribute on a recurring basis, you, as a Donor hereby acknowledge that Donation Subscriptions automatically renew and have a recurring payment feature, and that unless and until you opt out of the auto-renewal of the Donation Subscription, which can be done through the Platform, any Donation Subscriptions you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the initial term originally selected.\nIn connection with each of your Donation Subscriptions, you (i) hereby authorize Do Good Points to bill your Payment Instrument in the amount of the applicable Donation Installments in advance on a periodic basis until you terminate such periodic payments by opting out of the Donation Subscription, (ii) accept responsibility for payment of all Donation Installments occurring prior to opt out and (iii) agree to promptly update your Billing Account with any changes (for example, any changes related to your Payment Instrument, such as a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date).\nChanges to or termination of Donation Subscriptions or Donation Installments will apply only to Donation Installments that take place after Do Good Points receives notice of such change or termination.\nDo Good Points may provide refunds of any amounts received in connection with previously made Donation Installments on a case by case basis at the sole discretion of Do Good Points.\nAdditionally, by enrolling in any Donation Subscriptions, you acknowledge and agree for any and all such Donation Subscriptions, that (a) individual Donation Installments may not be tax deductible, even if previous Donation Installments for the same Donation Subscription were, and the amount of each Donation Installment that is tax deductible may vary, (b) one or more specific Donation Installment may not be provided to or received by the applicable cause, Charity or Campaign if such cause, Charity or Campaign becomes unavailable, unable to accept Donations, or chooses to stop receiving Donations, which may occur for various reasons, such as if the cause, Charity or Campaign becomes subject to an investigation or is suspended or removed from the Services by Do Good Points or (c) the amounts actually received by the applicable Campaign, Charity or cause may differ from one Donation Installment to the next (for example, if the Payment Processor fees associated with the Donation Installment change).\nIf you have questions about our refund policy, you can email support@dogoodpoints.com.</p>\n<p>Your non-termination of a Donation Subscription reaffirms that Do Good Points is authorized to charge your Payment Instrument for the Donation Subscription in accordance with these terms.\nThis does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.</p>\n<p>Good Points Loyalty Program: While Do Good Points does not provide any offers, promises, rewards or promotions in exchange for Donations, Users on the Do Good Points Platform are eligible to earn \u201cGood Points.\u201d In order to be eligible for the Good Points Loyalty Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d), Users must have a registered account on the Do Good Points Platform.\nMultiple accounts may not be merged or transferred.\nBy participating in this Program you are agreeing to these Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>Good Points may be earned by completing certain eligible actions on the Do Good Points Platform.\nExamples of such eligible actions may include creating an account, donating cash or points, sharing cause, content and organization information, subscribing to a newsletter, sharing your donation and more.</p>\n<p>Good Points earned for a Donation made may be revoked in the case that the Donation is later refunded or reversed for other reasons.\nGood Points may also be revoked where Do Good Points believes in its discretion that Good Points were earned through or in connection with any fraud, abuse of the Platform, or violation of the Do Good Points Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>When a minimum of Good Points have been accrued by a User, those Good Points may become convertible to a minimum required donation to a Charity or cause within the Platform.\nOne Good Point is currently equivalent to approximately $0.002 in donation value and the current valuation is subject to change.\nGood Points have no value outside of the Do Good Points Platform.\nUser actions may be subject to verification before their corresponding Good Points are added to a User\u2019s account.\nGood Points do not expire and are non-transferrable to any other User.\nThe number of Good Points required to convert to donation value may be modified by Do Good Points at any time.\nOnce Good Points are converted and redeemed for a Donation, they cannot be returned to your account.\nIf you believe there is any discrepancy in your Good Points balance, please contact our Customer Support team at support@dogoodpoints.com.\nIf we find that a correction is due, it may take up to four weeks.\nFailure to supply necessary documentation may result in an inability to award your Good Points.</p>\n<p>Participation in the Program is a benefit granted to registered Users, and as such can be suspended, revoked, or terminated at any time by us for any reason.\nIf your account is terminated, all Good Points associated with your account will be forfeited immediately upon termination.\nIf your account is terminated due to fraudulent activity or noncompliance with these Terms of Service, in addition to forfeiting all Good Points immediately, you cannot participate in or rejoin the Program.</p>\n<p>Campaign Organizers, Charities, or Beneficiaries</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Account Holds: </strong>From time to time, Do Good Points may, in its sole discretion, place a hold on a Campaign account (a \"Hold\"),

aren\u2019t necessarily limited to, the following: (i) if we have reason to believe (in our sole discretion) that information provided by a Campaign Organizer is false, misleading, or fraudulent, or

(such as a legal beneficiary or person entitled by law to act on behalf of a Charity), (iii) if we have reason to believe that a Campaign or Campaign Organizer has violated these Terms of Service, (iv) if Do Good Points determines that the Campaign Organizer is colluding with donors to engage in fraudulent activity, (v) if we have reason to believe (in our sole discretion) that there may be suspicious or fraudulent donation activity, or (vi) if required in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, writ, injunction, or as otherwise required under applicable laws and regulations.\nIf you have questions about a Hold we may have placed on your Campaign account, or need information about how to resolve the Hold, please contact your Campaign account manager.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Donation

consequences arising from such delay or inability.\nYou, as a Campaign Organizer, are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide to Do Good Points in order to process a Payout, including your bank account information, is accurate and up to date.\nDo Good Points may, at any time, for any reason, without notice, and in its sole discretion, offer or issue a refund of Donation(s) with or without consulting with you, which may comprise the entire amount donated to your campaign.\nDo Good Points is not liable to you or to any third party for any claims, damages, costs, losses, or other consequences caused by Do Good Points issuing refunds, including, but not limited to transaction or overdraft fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Payment Processors:</strong>Do Good Points

INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY.\nDISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING OUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either of us to (a) bring an individual action in small claims court.\n(b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.\n(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law.\nor (d) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Process:</strong> Any arbitration between you and us will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) as modified by these Terms of Service.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org.</p>\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.\nMail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (\u201cNotice of Arbitration\u201d).\nOur current address for Notice is: Do Good, Inc., \u2105 Legal Department, PO Box 193446, San Francisco, CA 94119.\nThe Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d).\nWe agree to work with you and make a good faith effort to resolve the claim directly, but if we aren\u2019t successful within 60 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nAll arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by either of us must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIf the arbitrator awards you an amount which exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by us in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, we will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator.\nor (ii) $10,000.00.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>Fees:</b> If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee unless your claim is for more than $10,000 in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place at an agreed upon location in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a telephone hearing or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address.\nIf the arbitration finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil procedure 11(b), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</li>\n<li>No Class Actions: YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS TO
