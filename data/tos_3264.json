THAT ANY DAMAGES YOU INCUR ARISING OUT OF TWiT' ACTS OR OMISSIONS OR YOUR USE OF TWiT SERVICES ARE NOT IRREPARABLE AND ARE INSUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF RESTRICTING THE AVAILABILITY OF OR ANY PERSON'S ABILITY TO ACCESS ANY PORTION OF THE TWiT SERVICES.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>U.S.\nExport Controls</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Software available in connection with the

U.S.\nexport laws.\nDownloading or using the Software is at your sole risk.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) TWiT, including its TWiT Affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, and you agree that any and all disputes and claims that each of you and TWiT may have against the other that arise out of or relate to the TWiT Services and your use of them, including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of this Agreement, including the agreement to arbitrate (the \"Arbitration Agreement\") and the scope or applicability of this Arbitration Agreement (collectively, \"Disputes\"), including but not limited to the arbitrability of any and all Disputes, and even if the events giving rise to Disputes occurred before this Arbitration Agreement became effective, will be resolved in a binding, confidential, individual and fair arbitration process, and not in court.\nEach of you and TWiT agrees to give up the right to sue in court.\nEach of you and TWiT also agrees to give up the right to have Disputes heard by a jury and the ability to seek to represent, in a class action or otherwise, anyone but each of you and TWiT (see paragraph 9 of this Arbitration Agreement below).\nThe only exceptions to this Arbitration Agreement are that (i) each of you and TWiT retains the right to sue in small claims court and (ii) each of you and TWiT may bring suit in court against the other to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>(2) This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\nThis Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>(3) Any arbitration between you and TWiT will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\") and will be governed by the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the \"AAA Rules\"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nThe AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator.\nIf you and we cannot agree on who that single arbitrator should be, then the AAA shall appoint an arbitrator with significant experience resolving the type of Dispute at issue.\nThe arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>(4) If either you or TWiT wants to arbitrate a Dispute, you or TWiT must first send by mail to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\") that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice, the specific facts giving rise to the Dispute, the TWiT Service to which the Notice relates, and the relief requested.\nYour Notice to TWiT must be sent by mail to Arbitration Notice of Dispute, Legal and Business Affairs, 1351-B Redwood Way, Petaluma, CA, 94954.\nTWiT will send any Notice to you at the contact information we have for you or that you provide.\nIt is the sender's responsibility to ensure that the recipient receives the Notice.\nDuring the first 45 days after you or we send a Notice to the other, you and we may try to reach a settlement of the Dispute.\nIf you and we do not resolve the Dispute within those first 45 days, either you or we may initiate arbitration in accordance with the rules and procedures provided for by the AAA.\nA form for initiating formal arbitration may be found on the AAA's website at www.adr.org (\"Arbitration Form\").\nIn addition to filing this Arbitration Form with AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, you must send a copy of this completed Arbitration Form to the TWiT at the address listed above to which you sent your Notice of Dispute.</p>\n<p>(5) AAA charges fees to conduct arbitrations.\nOrdinarily, the claimant has to pay that fee to start a case, but if you wish to commence an arbitration against TWiT, and you are seeking to recover less than $10,000 (inclusive of attorneys' fees), you will not have to pay this filing fee.\nTWiT will pay it on your behalf.\nIf you are seeking to recover $10,000 or more, you will have to pay the filing fee charged by AAA, but TWiT will reimburse that fee if you win the arbitration.</p>\n<p>(6) If you are seeking to recover $10,000 or less, AAA rules provide that the Dispute should be resolved without a hearing, by submission of documents only.\nEither you or we may request a hearing, however, and be responsible for the fees associated with it.\nIf the arbitrator recommends a hearing even if neither you nor we request one, TWiT will pay the arbitrator's fees associated with the hearing.\nIf the claim is for more than $10,000, the manner and place of the hearing will be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>(7) Regardless of how the arbitration proceeds, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain his or her findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p>(8) Each of you and TWiT may incur attorneys' fees during the arbitration.\nIn addition to whatever rights you may have to recover your attorneys' fees under Applicable Law, if you prevail in the arbitration, and if TWiT failed to make a settlement offer to you before the arbitration or the amount you win is at least 25% greater than TWiT's highest settlement offer to resolve the Dispute, then TWiT will pay your reasonable attorneys' fees in addition to the amount the arbitrator awarded.\nIf TWiT wins the arbitration, you will be responsible for your own attorneys' fees.\nIn addition, if the arbitrator, at the request of the winning party, finds that the losing party brought a Dispute or asserted a defense frivolously or for an improper purpose, then regardless of the amount in dispute, the arbitrator must order the losing party to pay both sides' arbitration fees and may order the losing party to pay the winning party's reasonable attorneys' fees, unless such an award of fees is prohibited by Applicable Law.</p>\n<p>(9) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nThe arbitrator may not order TWiT to pay any monies to or take any actions with respect to persons other than you, unless TWiT explicitly consents in advance, after an arbitrator is selected, to permit the arbitrator to enter such an order.\nYOU AND TWiT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A
