provisions.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Equitable Relief</b>.\nYou acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our intellectual property rights and confidential and proprietary

or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, or the Application shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association.\nThe one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against Confide in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.\nBut whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against Confide any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.\nBy using the Services or the Application in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.\nIn doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to

PROCEEDING.\nYour rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.\nDecisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.\nAny proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nIn the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Confide (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in New York County, New York.\nYou hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes and you irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury.\nThe Terms of Service, and any dispute between you and Confide, shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Online Dispute Resolution</b>.\nIf you reside in the European Union, you can

arbitrator to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court or arbitrator should endeavor to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions as reflected in the applicable provision, and any unenforceable provision shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Communications Decency Act Notice</b>.\nConfide is a provider of \u201cinteractive computer services\u201d as defined under the Communications Decency Act, 47 U.S.C.\nSection 230, and as such, our liability for defamation, libel, product disparagement, and other claims arising out of any communications sent by our users is limited as described therein.\nWe are not responsible for any communications of our users.\nWe neither warrant the accuracy of communications or exercise any editorial control over communications, nor do we assume any legal obligation for editorial control of communications or liability in connection with communications, including any responsibility or liability for investigating or verifying the accuracy of any communications.\nIn fact, as noted in our Privacy Policy, we do not (and cannot) read encrypted communications</p>\n<p>\n<b>Section Headings</b>.\nThe section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Force

Confide will use its commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the interruption of delay if it is reasonably capable of being remedied.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Waiver</b>.\nOur failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Terms of Service shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in the Terms of Service.\nNo waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Binding Agreement</b>.\nThe Terms of Service shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties</p>\n<p>\n<b>Compliance with Applicable Laws</b>.\nThe Services are based in the U.S.\nWe make no claims concerning whether the Services may be used or are appropriate for use outside of

with the applicable laws of your specific jurisdiction and industry</p>\n<p>\n<b>Ambiguous Terms</b>.\nAny ambiguities in the Terms of Service will not be strictly construed against the drafter of the

contracting.\nThe Terms of Service will not be construed against any party by reason of its preparation.</p>\n<br> 20.\nACCEPTABLE USE POLICY <p>Confide respects free and open discussion and dissemination of information.\nWhen there are competing interests at issue, however, Confide reserves the right to take certain preventive or corrective actions.\nIn order to protect these competing interests, Confide has developed this Acceptable Use Policy (\u201cAUP\u201d), which supplements and explains certain terms in the Terms of Service and further defines your rights and obligations when utilizing the Services.\nThis AUP may be revised from time to time, without any obligation to notify you of the same.\nYour use of the Services after changes to this AUP are made available through the Services shall constitute your acceptance of any new or additional terms.</p>\n<p>When you obtain information via the Services, you must keep in mind that we cannot, and do not make any attempt to monitor, verify, warrant, or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information that you may acquire.\nFor this reason, you must exercise your best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Services, and also should be aware that some material may be offensive.\nBecause we cannot monitor or censor the Services, and will not attempt to do so, Confide shall not be responsible for injury to you that results from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive, or illegal communications</p>\n<p>When you disseminate information via the Services, you must keep in mind that Confide does not review, edit, censor, or take responsibility for any information you may create.\nWhen you place information on the Services, you have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation, and other harmful speech.\nAlso, because the information you create is carried over networks and may reach a large number of people, your communications may affect other users and may harm our goodwill, business reputation, and operations.\nFor these reasons, you violate this AUP and the Terms of Service when you engage in or facilitate the following prohibited activities:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Intellectual Property Violations</b>.\nUsing the Services to engage in any activity that infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, patents, or privacy or publicity rights held by individuals, corporations, or other entities.\nWe are required by law to remove or block access to user content upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement.\nIt is also our policy to terminate the privileges of users who violate copyright laws.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Obscene Speech or Materials</b>.\nUsing the Services to view, advertise, transmit, store, post, display, or otherwise make available child pornography or obscene speech or material.\nWe are required by law to notify law enforcement agencies when we become aware of the presence of child pornography on or being transmitted through the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Defamatory or Abusive Language</b>.\nUsing the Services as a means to transmit or post defamatory, harassing, abusive, or threatening language.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Spamming</b>.\nUsing the Services to send unsolicited bulk and/or commercial messages (known as \u201cspamming\u201d).\nSpamming is not only harmful because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes toward Confide, but also because it can overload our networks and disrupt service to our other users.\nWhen a complaint is received, we have the discretion to determine from all of the evidence whether the recipients were from an \u201copt-in\u201d email list.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Forging of

information gathering activity).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, or Other Destructive Activities</b>.\nUsing the Services to distribute information regarding the creation of and sending Internet viruses, worms, trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mailbombing, or denial of service attacks.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Export Control Violations</b>.\nUsing the Services to export encryption software to points outside the United States.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Other Unlawful Uses</b>.\nUsing the Services for any unlawful purpose, including, without limitation, advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, fraudulently charging credit cards, or pirating content.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Market Research</b>.\nUsing the Services to collect any market

DISCLOSURES <p>Some web browsers may transmit \u201cdo-not-track\u201d (<b>\u201cDNT\u201d</b>) signals to the websites with which the user communicates.\nBecause of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are aware of them.\nBecause there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, our services do not currently process or respond to DNT settings in your web browser.\nIf and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</p>\n<br> 9.\nRETENTION AND DELETION <p>We will retain your personal information for only as long as is

with enough personal information about the consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular consumer's personal information (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID).\nAs required by the CCPA, we do not include that personal information in response to Verifiable Consumer Requests.\nIf we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sale of Personal Information.</b> We do not knowingly \"sell\" personal information that we collect from you, in accordance with the definition of \"sell\" in the CCPA, and will treat personal information we collect from you as subject to a do not sell request.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Shine the Light Law.</b> California's \"Shine the Light\" law, Civil Code \u00a7 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.\nWe do not currently engage in the type of sharing covered by this law and as a result, no such list exists.\nWe do not make any representations concerning third parties that do not collect personal information directly through our services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Miscellaneous.</b> We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify consumer personal information that we collect, process, store, disclose, and otherwise use and to respond to your CCPA rights requests.\nWe will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests, but we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded, or overly burdensome.\nAlso, we will not discriminate against you in a manner prohibited by the CCPA because you exercise your CCPA rights.\nHowever, we may charge a different price or rate, or offer a different level or quality of goods or services, to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the applicable data.\nIn addition, we may offer you financial incentives for the collection, sale, and retention and use of your personal information as permitted by the CCPA that can, without limitation, result in reasonably different prices, rates, or quality levels.\nThe material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described in its program terms.\nWe may add or change incentive programs and/or their terms by posting a notice on the program descriptions and terms linked to above so check them regularly.</p>\n<br> 13.\nUPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we modify our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised version here, with an updated revision date.\nIf we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we may also notify you by other means, such as by posting a notice on our website or mobile application or sending you a notification.\nBy continuing to use our services after such revisions are in effect, you accept and agree to the revisions and to abide by them.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to learn how Confide is protecting your information.</p>\n<br> 14.\nCOMMUNICATION PREFERENCES <p>Confide uses email as a primary communications channel to keep our customers, prospective customers and other stakeholders informed of our
