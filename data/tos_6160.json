you used EAB Properties prior to the date you accepted the TOUs, you hereby acknowledge and agree that the TOUs commenced on the date you first used EAB Properties (whichever is earlier) and will remain in full force and effect while you use EAB Properties, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the TOUs.</p>\n<p>You may discontinue your participation in and access to the EAB Properties at any time.\n</p>\n<p>Termination of any Service includes removal of access to such Service and barring of further use of the Service.\nTermination of all Services also includes all related

without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.</p>\n16.\nArbitration Agreement\n<p>All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the TOUs or the use of any product or service provided by EAB that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.\nUnless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.\nThis Arbitration Agreement applies to you and EAB, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the TOUs.</p>\n<p>Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.\nA Notice to EAB should be sent to: 2445 M Street, NW, Attn: General Counsel, Washington DC 20037.</p>\n<p>After the Notice is received, you and EAB may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.\nIf you and EAB do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.\nThe amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</p>\n<p>Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (\u201cADR Provider\u201d) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.\nIf AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.\nThe rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the TOUs.\nThe AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.\nAny claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.\nFor claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.\nAny hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.\nIf you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nIf the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that EAB made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, EAB will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.\nEach party shall bear its own costs (including attorney\u2019s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>\n<p>If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions.\nthe specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.\nThe arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>\n<p>If you or EAB pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>\n<p>If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and EAB, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the TOUs.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and EAB.</p>\n<p>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and EAB in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND EAB WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.\nThe parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.\nThis paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>\n<p>If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.\nSuch waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with EAB.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or EAB may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.\nA request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to the laws of the District of Columbia and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the District of Columbia for such purpose.</p>\n17.\nGeneral Provisions\n<p>The communications between you and EAB use

commit to responding to browsers\u2019 DNT signals with respect to our websites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or

transmission of personal information to and from our network.\nwe work with clients to discourage transmission that is otherwise not secure.\nThis is accomplished through a combination of secure technologies like SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) for in-transit encryption of bulk file transfers and SSL/TLS encryption in transit for web traffic.</p>\n<p>Datacenter controls include the use of SOC-audited data centers with physical controls including multi-factor authentication for access, 24\u00d77 monitoring, video monitoring, and locked cages.\nWe also have active detection (IDS monitoring, log consolidation, alerting) and prevention (IPS, firewall, security zones) programs to protect personal information, and vetted third party providers for centralized audit logging
