expects community members to treat each other with respect and courtesy.\nThese standards apply to interaction within all ABC Online Services including official ABC accounts established on third-party social media sites.</p>\n<p>You understand and agree the ABC has ultimate editorial control over all its online services.\nThe ABC may edit, remove or exercise its discretion not to publish your contribution for legal, editorial or operational reasons including if the ABC considers it to be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>defamatory, or otherwise unlawful or that it violates laws regarding harassment,

appropriate content is made available to children who use ABC Online Services.\nFor example, when a sub-profile is created for a child on ABC iview, the ABC will make available content that is suitable for their age group.\nIt is important for parents and guardians to monitor and participate in their children\u2019s use of ABC Online Services to protect their safety and prevent access to inappropriate content.</p>\n<p>When contributions are sought from, likely to have been submitted by, or include children and/or young people (under 18), the ABC will, where appropriate, seek the consent of a child\u2019s parent or guardian before using a child\u2019s contribution on ABC platforms.</p>\n<p>You must not create a sub-profile for a child on iview unless consent to these terms is in place in relation to the child.&nbsp.\nIf you are the parent or guardian of the child, you must only create a sub-profile for the child if you consent on the child\u2019s behalf, and (if the child is old enough to consent) you have also confirmed that the child consents.&nbsp.\nIf you are not the parent or guardian of the child, you must ensure that a parent or guardian of the child has taken those steps.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThe ABC will proceed on the basis that by creating a profile for a child you confirm that you have ensured that consent in in place in relation to that child.</p>\n<p>Parents

committed to protecting your privacy when you interact with us, our content, products, or services.&nbsp.\nWe are bound by the&nbsp;<em>Privacy Act 1988</em>&nbsp;(Cth).</p>\nPurpose of this Policy\n<p>This policy explains our personal information handling practices.\nIt describes how we may collect, use, and disclose information about you or your use of our content, products, or services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ABC Program Material is not subject to the Privacy Act.\nit is governed by the&nbsp;ABC Code of Practice&nbsp;and&nbsp;ABC Editorial Policies.</p>\n<p>You can find the date of the most recent review of this policy at the end of this document.</p>\n1.\nCollection of Personal Information\n1.1 Kinds of personal information we collect\n<p>The kinds of personal information we collect about you may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your name;</li>\n<li>login details;</li>\n<li>contact details;</li>\n<li>demographic information;</li>\n<li>competition entries;</li>\n<li>preferences and interests;</li>\n<li>user generated content;</li>\n<li>research or survey responses.\nand</li>\n<li>payment details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the personal information we collect about you may be sensitive information, including information about your race or ethnicity, political opinions or affiliations, religious beliefs or affiliations, physical or mental health and sexuality.</p>\n<p>Depending on the circumstances of collection, it may be possible for you to provide information to the ABC in a pseudonymous way so that your identity is not revealed.\nFor example, you may wish to sign up for an ABC Account by using an email address that does not include your name and by providing a nickname rather than your actual name.\nThe same applies in relation to any sub-profiles you create on ABC iview.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances however this may not be practicable, for example where a person must disclose their identity before being granted entry to the ABC studio as an audience member.</p>\n<p>We also collect information about your use of our digital services.\nThe kinds of information we collect about you in this context are described in section 1.2(c) below.\nSuch information may, depending on the circumstances, constitute personal information.</p>\n1.2 How we collect personal information\n<p>The main circumstances in which the ABC collects personal information about you are:</p>\n(a) when you provide it to us\n<p>If you register as a user of ABC digital services, by creating an ABC Account, you will provide information to us as part of your registration.&nbsp;You may also give us information when you make a purchase from us, sign up to receive ABC newsletters or enter competitions, contribute user generated content, participate in research or surveys or otherwise participate in ABC functions or activities.\nFor information about our collection and retention of payment information see&nbsp;below.</p>\nPayment information<p>If you use Shopify to complete your transaction, your personal information (including credit card information) will be collected and used by Shopify.\nFor more information, you can read the Shopify Privacy Policy here.</p>\n<p>If you use your credit card and the transaction is manual rather than electronic, the imprinted record will be stored by us for the period that financial records are required to be retained.</p>\n(b) when someone else provides it to us on your behalf\n<p>Sometimes someone else such as a parent, carer or friend might provide us with information about you so that we can provide you with products or services.&nbsp;For example, someone else may provide us with information about you when creating a sub-profile for you on ABC iview.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, we may also collect information about you from our ABC online store fulfilment partners.\nOther times we may collect personal information about you from publicly available sources, including social media sites, or when you sign up for an ABC Account via another account.</p>\n<p>For more information about our practices in relation to children, see below.</p>\nAdditional information for parents and young people<p>The digital services provided by the ABC allow access by children and some are specifically designed for children.\nABC KIDS for pre-school children and&nbsp;ABC&nbsp;ME for older children are examples.\nWhen a sub-profile is created for a child on ABC iview, the ABC will make available content that is suitable for their age group.\nWe strongly encourage parents and carers to monitor and participate in their children\u2019s use of the ABC\u2019s digital services.</p>\n<p>The ABC aims to ensure that children and young people who engage with our online spaces understand the possible risks they face and how to minimise them.\nABC digital services designed for children are subject to House Rules which guide participation and are designed to maintain safe and appropriate behaviour.\nHouse Rules include restrictions on the types of personal information the ABC allows children to communicate publicly.\nContent submitted to ABC children\u2019s sites is largely pre-moderated in order to enforce the House Rules and protect children.</p>\n<p>If your child is participating in ABC online community activities, we recommend you read the House Rules for that space with your child and explain anything to them that they may not understand.</p>\n<p>The ABC policy in relation to Cookies, Beacons, Local Storage and Other Technologies described below&nbsp;applies to all ABC properties, including those specifically designed for children.\nParents and carers should also be aware that if their children are using social media sites that were not designed for their age group, they will be exposed to the various tracking and analytic technologies applied by third parties when they access or share ABC content on or via those sites.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Children will be automatically opted out of the disclosure of a hashed version of their email address for the purpose of promotional targeting.</p>\n(c) when we collect it in relation to your use of digital services\n<p>We also collect information about your use of our digital services through the use of technologies like cookies, beacons and local storage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you use our websites, mobile sites, mobile applications, email newsletters or applications on any other devices such as Apple TV, Chromecast or PlayStation, these technologies may be used to improve your user experience and our digital services.\nThey may also be used to show you promotions for ABC content on third party digital services, such as Google and Facebook, as well as on ABC digital services.</p>\n<p>From July 2021, registration for an ABC Account will be required in order to access ABC iview.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You will remain able to access our content, including news, on our other websites and apps, and through our broadcasts, without registering for an ABC Account.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are a registered ABC Account holder, or newsletter subscriber, we may link the information collected about you to your account.&nbsp.\nIf a sub-profile is created for you on ABC iview, we may link the information collected about you with your sub-profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are not a registered ABC Account holder, or newsletter subscriber, and you do not have a sub-profile on ABC iview, then we will track this information by reference to digital information such as an IP address, or an identifier for your device or browser, and will not seek to identify you.</p>\n<p>If we do not collect information about you or your use of our digital services, we may not be able to provide you with certain digital services, or we may not be able to tailor or enhance your reading, viewing or listening experience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nUse of Cookies, Beacons, local storage, and Other Technologies Across our digital services\nWhat are these technologies?<p>\u201cCookies\u201d and \u201clocal storage\u201d are technologies that allow websites, applications and emails to gather information and store it on your computer or device.\nThis information is used to identify your browser or device so that these websites and applications can follow your user activity over time and remember things such as your personalised settings and preferences.</p>\n<p>A \u201cbeacon\u201d is a signal sent from your computer or device to a server on the Internet.\nWebsites, applications and emails use software that reads cookies, local storage and other information stored on your computer or device and sends beacons to record that information.\nThis may include information about your user activity, including behavioural data such as your viewing history and location data such as your IP address, as well as information about your personalised settings and preferences.</p>Why do we use these technologies?<p>The ABC uses these technologies in a variety of ways to deliver, measure and improve our services and products.\nThese uses generally fall into one of the following categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Site and application functionality: To enable interactive features such as forums, voting, some games, and online shopping.\nFor instance, cookies allow our servers to keep track of your customer details between visits to our websites.\nThey can allow us to remember your place in a video so you can pick up where you left off or remember your preferences and settings so you get your local weather or preferred radio station.\nIn order to deliver similar functionality, some ABC websites and applications may also ask your permission to collect geolocation data.</li>\n<li>Promotional targeting: Placing cookies on your device or browser also means we can serve you promotional information that you might be more interested in.\nThe promotional information can appear on third party digital services as well as ABC digital services.\nIt also allows us to control the number of times you see that promotional information and measure how effective the campaign has been.</li>\n<li>Audience analytics: The aggregate information gathered from these technologies helps us to improve our products and understand how people use our services.</li>\n<li>Personalised content and services: Information about what content is viewed allows us to customise our services with more relevant content like tailored trends or recommendations.\nFor example, by knowing what articles you have already read, cookies can help us make smarter and more relevant suggestions about what new content you might enjoy or find useful.\nYou will still be able to watch other content too.</li>\n</ol>Third party cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies<p>The ABC allows a number of its suppliers to use cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies on ABC digital services to gather information about visitor activity in order to deliver their services.</p>\n<p>These third parties may include:</p>\n<p>a) marketing and promotions service providers including social media platforms, such as Facebook, and digital advertising services, such as Google Ads;</p>\n<p>b) analytics service providers, such as Google Analytics (more information here) and Chartbeat.\nand</p>\n<p>c) ratings service providers such as Nielsen, which measures digital audiences in Australia (more information here), and OzTAM, which measures broadcast video on demand and live streaming audiences in Australia.</p>\n<p>In addition, if we embed posts, photos or videos from third parties, such as Facebook and YouTube, those third parties may use cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies in relation to that content.\nIf you then \u201cshare\u201d that content, the service you have chosen to share content through may also use these technologies.\nThe ABC cannot control the use of cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies in relation to embedded content, or content sharing, and does not block third parties from using these technologies in these ways.</p>\n<p>The ABC does not collect personal information about you when we allow third parties to use cookies, beacons, local storage and other technologies on our digital services.</p>Controlling and deleting cookies<p>Popular browsers will usually give users a level of control over cookies.</p>\n<p>You can set your browsers to accept or reject all, or certain, cookies.\nYou can also set your browser to prompt you each time a cookie is offered.</p>\n<p>Most cookies are easy to delete, and the \u2018Help\u2019 function within your browser should tell you how.\nSome digital services may not load properly or function as intended if cookies are disabled, however it is up to you to determine the balance of convenience and computer privacy that you are comfortable with.</p>\n<p>Some browsers offer a \u2018Do Not Track\u2019 (DNT) setting, which sends an additional piece of information when a cookie is downloaded that the user does not wish to be tracked.\nHowever, the ABC\u2019s digital services do not recognise DNT settings.</p>\n<p>The ABC uses beacons in combination with cookies to track activity.\nIf you turn off a browser\u2019s cookies, the beacon will still record your visit anonymously, however your unique information will not be recorded.&nbsp.\nIf you turn off cookies then we may not be able to personalise or customise content for you, which will affect your user experience.</p>\n<p>Our applications and email newsletters do not offer these controls.</p>Information that is personally identifiable to the ABC**<p>If you have registered for an ABC Account, or subscribed to an ABC newsletter, or if a sub-profile is created for you on ABC iview, we may combine information from your registration with the information we collect about your use of our digital services, and other information you provide to us.\nThis is done in order to analyse how you and other people use our digital services in detail and, where you have opted to receive such communications, to send you email and other communications that might be of interest to you.\nThis information may also be used to provide personalised services or content suggestions based on your previous use of our digital services, and to show you promotions for ABC content on third party digital services as well as ABC digital services.&nbsp.\nThe combined information may include information that is collected about your use of our digital services while you are not signed in, and information that was collected before you registered or signed in.\nWhere the combined information can be used to identify you, we may use and disclose it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n2.\nUse and Disclosure of Personal Information\n2.1 Purposes for which we collect, use, and disclose personal information\n<p>The purposes for which we collect, use and disclose personal information include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to provide our products and services to you (including physical delivery);</li>\n<li>to enhance our content and services using your contributions;</li>\n<li>to help us understand more about our

content;</li>\n<li>to manage our relationship with you, including:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(a) communicating with you, including providing information about activities, products, services and events which we

insurance services;</li>\n<li>if permitted or required by law;</li>\n<li>otherwise with your consent.\nor</li>\n<li>for purposes directly related to any one or more of the above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not send you unsolicited direct marketing emails, without your prior consent, unless we are permitted to do so by law.\nWe will always give you the option to opt out of further communications.&nbsp.\nWe may send you electronic communications for account administration purposes for so long as you are a registered user or customer of the ABC.</p>\n2.2 Disclosure of personal information\n<p>We may disclose your personal information that we collect to our:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>technology service providers, including, internet service providers, app service providers, cloud hosting service providers, software suppliers, and maintenance and support service providers and security services on a confidential basis so that they can provide services to us;</li>\n<li>ABC online store fulfilment partners and delivery service providers;</li>\n<li>marketing and promotions service providers.\nand</li>\n<li>analytics service providers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As described above in the section on \u201cThird party cookies, beacons and other technologies\u201d, we may also allow some of our marketing and promotions service providers, as well as our analytics and ratings service providers, to collect information about your use of ABC digital services along with identifiers for your device or browser.</p>\n<p>We may separately disclose the information we collect about your use of ABC digital services to third parties, along with those same identifiers, so that they can provide services to us and so that we can help you find content likely to be of interest to you including by making recommendations to you.\nSome third parties may be able to match information about your use of our digital services with personal information they already have about you.</p>\n<p>From July 2021, if you are a registered ABC Account holder, we may disclose a hashed version of your email address to Google and Facebook, via a technology service provider called Tealium, to show you promotions for ABC content likely to be of interest to you on those platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You will be able to opt out of the disclosure of a hashed version of your email address to those platforms in your ABC Account settings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are not a registered ABC Account holder, we may disclose the identifier for your device or browser to Google and Facebook, via Tealium, for the same purpose.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to see our promotional information on those platforms, you can opt out via the account settings for those platforms.&nbsp.\nYou can also visit Your Online Choices and do a blanket opt out for the organisations who signed up to Your Online Choices.</p>\n<p>The third parties we disclose information to, or allow to collect information about you, may be located in Australia or outside Australia, including but not limited to New Zealand, Singapore, the UK, the Netherlands, Ireland, Israel, India, Canada and the USA.</p>\n<p>We require that our service providers have appropriate controls to protect your personal information and that they only use your personal information for authorised purposes.\nThe ABC will not sell or receive payment for licensing or disclosing your personal information.</p>\n<p>The ABC may include links to third party content on its website and in other electronic communications.&nbsp.\nThe ABC does not have any control over the privacy practices of those third parties.&nbsp.\nPlease check the website of each relevant third party for details of their privacy policies.&nbsp.\nThe ABC does not control who links to the ABC\u2019s site.</p>\n2.3 Options to enter into additional privacy terms\n<p>We will sometimes give you an option to use products or services which are provided in conjunction with other entities such as social media platforms.&nbsp.\nIf we do this, you should be given privacy information before being asked to consent to the terms and conditions of that service.&nbsp.\nYou should read the privacy policy and terms and conditions of each service very carefully before deciding whether to accept them.&nbsp.\nYou should also be careful to ensure that you only post information online if you are happy for it to be and to remain publicly available.</p>\n3.\nSeeking access to, and updating, information we hold about you\n<p>You have the right to request access to personal information
