User: we put this Privacy Statement in place so that you know how we handle your data.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis Privacy Statement applies to the privacy practices of DuckDNS on its website, located at https://www.duckdns.org/, and to the Dynamic DNS service (DDNS Service) offered through our website.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis Privacy Statement is designed to comply with the GDPR (the EU General Data Protection Regulation of 2018) and other applicable privacy laws.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe may update our policies in order to reflect changes to our practices on the collection, storage and use of your personal information.\nIf you want to have the latest information about our personal information handling practices and what information we may collect through this website or when you register for a domain name, we suggest that you check this website frequently for updates to our Privacy Statement.\nThe latest version will always be posted at this website.\n<p>\n1.\nInformation that we collect and why we collect it\n</p>\n<b>Signing In.</b> When you visit our website, you can choose to sign in through your Twitter, Reddit, or Google account, by signing in through an existing Persona or GitHub account.\nWhenever you choose to sign in, you authorize us to collect certain information from that social media account (name, username, email address, profile picture, and any other basic information required or granted by the OAuth process).\nYou may be able to control what information you provide us within the preferences or settings of your social media account.\nWe use this information to personalize your experience on the website and to provide the DDNS Service.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Using the DDNS Service.</b> When you use the DDNS Service, we collect certain information regarding your use of the Website from you, including identifiers such as: the IP address used to sign in, your email address, an access token issued to you for authorization (required by the DDNS Service API), and your target IP address.\nWe use this information to enable the DDNS Service, and this information can be personal information in that it may be possible to identify you either on its own or in connection with other information.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Social Media.</b> We may offer you the opportunity to engage with DuckDNS or its content on or through third-party social media websites, plug-ins, and applications.\nWhen you engage with us on or through third-party social media websites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information associated with your social media account (for example: name, username, email address or profile picture) to deliver content or as part of the operation of the DuckDNS website, plug-in, or application.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Information we Collect Automatically.</b> We and our third-party service providers, including Google Analytics, process, store and analyze information obtained from your browser when you visit our website, including IP addresses, device identifiers, browser characteristics, operating system details, language preferences, referring URLs, length of visits, and pages viewed.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis website also uses cookies or other tools that track, measure and analyze the behaviors and usage patterns of visitors to the website, and to facilitate user login.\n<br>\nFor

can recognize you when you return), you do not have to login with a password for each request that you make, thereby making the user experience of our site optimal.\nWe use cookies for analytics purposes and for certain features of the website.\nYou can choose to not accept cookies, but it may affect your ability to login to, or to effectively use the website.\nCookies may also used on our website by third parties for analytics, specifically, by Google Analytics, Twitter, Reddit, Paypal, and Bitcoin.\n<br>\n<br>\nYour web browser may have settings that allow you to transmit a \"Do Not Track\" signal when you visit various websites or use online services.\nLike many websites, this website is not designed to respond to \"Do Not Track\" signals received from browsers.\n<p>\n2.\nSharing of Personal Data\n</p>\nExcept as set forth in this Privacy Statement and as required or permitted by law, we do not share your personal information with third parties

parties who provide website and administrative/operational support services on our behalf.\nPersonal information may be collected by such providers for their own use, in line with their own privacy practices.\nYou may check the privacy statements of each of these providers to decide whether you are comfortable with their policies.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe use third parties, including Google Analytics and Google Drive, to host and manage our website, to provide analytics, to detect and combat fraud or other illegal activities, and to store data.\nWe have reviewed Google\u2019s privacy policies, specifically for each of these services, and we think that their standards are in-line with our own.\nHowever, you should read these privacy policies for yourself and/or contact us with any questions that you may have, to decide for yourself.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur service providers are given the information they need to perform their designated functions, and except for the reasons stated in this Privacy Statement, are not authorized to use or disclose personal information for other purposes.\n<br>\n<br>\nYour personal information may be maintained and processed by us, our affiliates and other third-party service providers in the US or other jurisdictions.\nIn the event that personal information is transferred outside of the EU or Canada, to the US or other foreign jurisdiction, it may also

is Duckbill Holdings (Canada) Ltd.\n<br>\n<br>\nOne of your rights under the GDPR and other data protection laws is to opt out of data collection and transfers.\nUsers of DuckDNS can also request the correction/update, copy, or deletion of any of their personal information that we have in our system at any time.\nTo make such a request or exercise a right under relevant data protection laws, including if you wish to opt out of a consent that you may have provided to us in the past, please refer to the instructions contained in the section of this Privacy Statement that is called

collected about you, the purpose of such collection and categories of third parties with whom we share such data.\nThis information has already been provided you in this Privacy Statement, above.\n<br>\n<br>\nSince our users\u2019 personal information is what we use to administer accounts and DuckDNS access, you may manually delete your account and the information that we have for you, and this will remove your personal information from our database.\nFor instructions on how to manually delete your account, please refer to our FAQ page (http://www.duckdns.org/faqs.jsp).\nOnce you

may contact us regarding any privacy-related requests, questions, or concerns that you may have regarding this Privacy Statement and how we handle personal information that is collected and processed
