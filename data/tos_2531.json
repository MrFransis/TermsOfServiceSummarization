arbitrate\" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.\nYou and NBCUniversalagree that we intend that this Section 26 satisfies the \"writing\" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nThis Section 26 can only be amended by mutual agreement.\nFor non-U.S.\nresidents, if binding arbitration is adjudged by a tribunal to be unenforceable, the provisions of Section 27 shall apply to all relevant disputes between you and us.</p>\n<p>We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us.\nTherefore, pursuant to these Terms of Service, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Site or other online services, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with NBCUniversal, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to NBCUniversal or that NBCUniversal may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, \"NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships\"), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration.\nBy using or interacting with the Site or other online service, or engaging in any other NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.</p>\n<p>We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us.\nIf those efforts fail, by using our Site or other online service, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against NBCUniversal, and any claim that NBCUniversal may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, or any NBCUniversal Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\"Arbitration\") administered by JAMS or its successor (\"JAMS\") and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the \"Applicable Rules\").\nThe Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com.\nIf JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the \"AAA\") instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the \"Applicable Rules\" in such circumstances).\nIf JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, NBCUniversal agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section 26, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below.\nFurthermore, this Section 26 shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\nYou further agree that:</p>\n<p>(a) Single Arbitrator.\nThe Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and NBCUniversal (the \"Arbitrator\");</p>\n<p>(b) Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement.\nThe Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service and/or these arbitration provisions in Section 26 hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable;</p>\n<p>(c) Location of Arbitration.\nThe Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business).\nor (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and NBCUniversal.\nor (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.</p>\n<p>(d) Governing Law.\nThe Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of New York consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles.\n(ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with New York or federal rules of procedure, as applicable.\n(iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.\nand (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;</p>\n<p>(e) No Class Relief.\nThe Arbitration can resolve only your and/or NBCUniversal's individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;</p>\n<p>(f) Written Award.The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator's complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an \"Award\").\nJudgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;</p>\n<p>(g) Arbitration Costs.\nIn the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, NBCUniversal will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;</p>\n<p>(h) Reasonable Attorney's Fees.\nIn the event you recover an Award greater than NBCUniversal's last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award NBCUniversal's reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys' fees associated with the Arbitration, but NBCUniversal shall in all events bear its own attorneys' fees.\nand</p>\n<p>(i) Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause.\nWith the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\nIf, however, subpart (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor NBCUniversal shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>(j) Modification of Arbitration Clause With Notice.\nNBCUniversal may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after NBCUniversal has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from NBCUniversal Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.</p>\n<p>(k) Small Claims Matters are Excluded.\nNo Class Relief or Joinder of Claims.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against NBCUniversal in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court's jurisdictional limit.\nprovided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.</p>\n<p>27.\nDispute Resolution for Non-US Residents Only if a Tribunal has Ruled that Arbitration is Prohibited by Law</p>\n<p>This Section 27 applies to non-US Residents, where applicable law prohibits arbitration of disputes in accordance with Section 26.</p>\n<p>(a) Section 27 disputes.\nIf any controversy, allegation, or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the online services, the Content, these Terms of Service, whether heretofore or hereafter arising or to any of NBCUniversal's actual or alleged intellectual property rights (collectively, a \"Section 27 Dispute\"), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Section 27 Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.\nOur notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.\nBut if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 27(a).\nYour notice to us must be sent to:</p>\n<p>By mail: Gillian M.\nLusins</p>\n<p>NBC Universal Law Department</p>\n<p>30 Rockefeller Plaza, Rm.\n1087E</p>\n<p>New York, New York 10112</p>\n<p>By e-mail:

Section 27 Dispute, though nothing will require either you or NBCUniversal to resolve the Section 27 Dispute on terms with respect to which you and NBCUniversal, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.</p>\n<p>(b) Jurisdiction.\nThe parties agree that the state or federal courts in New York shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Section 27 Dispute.</p>\n<p>(c) Governing Law.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by the mandatory laws in your country of residence, these Terms of Service and any Section 27 Dispute arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes), will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the U.S.\nand the State of New York without regard to its conflicts of law provisions, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.</p>\n<p>(d) Limited Time to File Claims.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A SECTION 27 DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 27(a) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER DISCOVERY OF THE SECTION 27 DISPUTE ARISES - OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>\n<p>(e) Injunctive Relief.\nThe foregoing provisions of this Section 27 will not apply to any legal action taken by NBCUniversal to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the online services, any Content, your User Content and/or NBCUniversal's intellectual property rights (including such NBCUniversal may claim that may be in dispute), NBCUniversal's operations, and/or NBCUniversal's products or services.</p>\n<p>28.\nMember Disputes</p>\n<p>You are
