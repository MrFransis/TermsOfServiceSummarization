PRIVACY POLICY <p>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that The Associated Press and its affiliates (referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as \u201cAP\u201d, \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and other similar pronouns) collect through those AP websites and mobile applications which make this Privacy Policy available (each such website and mobile application, a \u201cService\u201d).</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we may collect, how we may use and disclose the information once it is collected, and, where applicable, how you can stop us from collecting, using, disclosing or continuing to hold your information.\nWe want to ensure that in using any of the Services, you understand the terms of this Privacy Policy, including any subsequent changes made to the Privacy Policy as described in Part 11 below, and are aware of the privacy choices available to you.\nPlease note that this Privacy Policy <u>does not</u> apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, where a separate privacy policy is made available to you or which do not make this Privacy Policy available.&nbsp;</p>\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWhat information may be collected?\n<b>\n<i>User-Provided Information</i>\n</b>\n<p>During your use of a Service (whether as a registered or unregistered user), you may provide us with personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, or other information that could be used to identify you as an individual or allow someone to contact you, as well as any information associated with such information (collectively, \u201cPersonal Information\u201d).\nPersonal Information includes both things that specifically identify you (like your real name) and things that don\u2019t specifically identify you, but might be connected back to you (like the IP address of your computer or the device identifier of your smartphone).</p>\n<b>\n<i>Location Data</i>\n</b>\n<p>When using our Services from a mobile device (a \u201cMobile Service\u201d), you may share the geographic location of your device with us.\nYour device location may be transmitted to us whenever a Mobile Service is running (even if you are not actively using the Mobile Service or it is running in the background on your device).\nYour device may continue to transmit its location to us until you change your device settings.</p>\n<p>If you set your device not to transmit location information to us, certain features of our Services may not be available or their functions may be limited.\nFor example, you will have to manually enter a location when conducting a search.\nYou should also know that turning off location sharing only prevents your device from sharing its precise location.\nYour network service provider may still provide general location information (based on access points you\u2019ve connected to, for example).\nThe information provided varies by network service provider.\nYou should check with your network service provider to find out what information is provided and if there are ways for you to limit it.</p>\n<b>\n<i>Service Usage Information</i>\n</b>\n<p>As is typical of many web sites and mobile applications, when you use our Services, we may collect information about your device and your usage of our Services including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your IP address (which we may associate with your domain name or that of your Internet access provider or wireless carrier, and your location);</li>\n<li>Unique ID number associated with your device;</li>\n<li>Other unique identifiers such as advertising identifiers (e.g., \"ad-ID\" or \"IDFA\");</li>\n<li>Web browser and operating system information;</li>\n<li>Language of your device;</li>\n<li>Wireless connections you are using;</li>\n<li>Referring page that linked you to us;</li>\n<li>Your activities, including browsing and transaction history;</li>\n<li>Pages, content, and ads you view or click on during your use of our Services, and when and for how long you do so;</li>\n<li>The next web site you visit after leaving our web site.\nand</li>\n<li>Search terms you enter on our Services or a referral site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, we may deploy tracking technologies through our Services to collect additional information about your use of the Services, as set out in the \u201cCookies and other tracking technologies\u201d section of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nHow is your information used?\n<p>We or our service providers may use the information we collect from or about you to perform the following functions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>administer our Services and your account with us;</li>\n<li>enable you to use our Services and their features;</li>\n<li>customize our Services to your interests and history with us;</li>\n<li>localize the content and articles that are displayed to you based on your geographical location;</li>\n<li>conduct market research;</li>\n<li>improve or develop new features and offerings in our Services;</li>\n<li>tailor ads displayed to you in our Services and elsewhere;</li>\n<li>send you marketing and other communications, including information about products, services, or events that we think might be of interest to you;</li>\n<li>assess your level of interest in and use of our Services, e-mails, and other messaging campaigns, both on an individual basis and in aggregate;</li>\n<li>generate analytics reports on the usage of our Services.\nand</li>\n<li>respond to your requests, questions, and concerns protecting our rights and property.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also use Personal Information to meet our internal and external audit requirements and for information security purposes.\nWhere permissible under applicable law, your Personal Information may be used for other purposes, which will be disclosed to you at the time when your information is collected.\nThere may be instances, however, when we will use your Personal Information for purposes that were not disclosed at the time of the data collection.\nfor example, when doing so is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or requirement.\nWe may use Personal Information to (a) respond to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include such authorities outside your country of residence.\n(b) enforce our terms and conditions.\nand (c) protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or those of other persons.</p>\n<p>Some of the uses specified above are necessary for the performance of a contract between us, or for the provision of a service requested by you.\nIn other cases, the uses are based on our legitimate interests such as marketing our services to people who have expressed an interest in them or similar services.&nbsp;</p>\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nHow do we share the information we collect?\n<p>We may share your information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>with our lawyers, auditors, and other professional advisors, third party advertising companies (including exchanges and brokers) and third party providers of services such as cloud storage, customer relationship management systems, travel and expense management, analytics databases, who need your information to provide services to us (or on our behalf);</li>\n<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or property, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government agency, law enforcement, judicial or public authority, or other legal request, or to comply with the law;</li>\n<li>in connection with a proposed corporate change or dissolution, including for example a merger, acquisition, reorganization, consolidation, bankruptcy, liquidation, sale of assets or wind down of business.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information about usage of the Services (including aggregate data) with others, for their own use, in a de-identified form.</p>\n<p>In addition, what you voluntarily post to public areas of our Service may be available to other Service users.</p>\n<b>\n<i>Transfers outside the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) </i>\n</b>\n<p>The information described in this section of the Privacy Policy, with respect to the transfer of data outside the EEA, applies to those individuals located in the EEA.\nTo process information of individuals located in the EEA for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal data outside the EEA, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>with our offices outside the EEA;</li>\n<li>with service providers located outside the EEA;</li>\n<li>if you are based outside the EEA;</li>\n<li>where we consider that the transfer is necessary for exercising, establishing or defending legal rights including, as appropriate, providing information to respond to a government, law enforcement, judicial or other legal request, or otherwise to comply with applicable law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Non-EEA countries might not have the same legal framework for data protection as the EEA countries.\nIn particular, the United States, which is the most common destination of our transfers of Personal Information outside the EEA, is not considered to provide a level of personal data protection equivalent to that of the EEA.\nWe will, however, ensure the transfers comply with EU data protection law.\nOur standard practice is to use standard data protection contract clauses approved by the European Commission as the basis for such data transfers.\n&nbsp;You may read more about this on the European Commission Justice website at (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm).</p>\n<p>If you would like further information, please see \u201cContact us\u201d section below.</p>\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nHow do we secure your Personal Information?\n<p>We use reasonable technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect Personal Information collected via our Services.\nWe cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from unauthorized access or use (e.g., by hackers).\nYou use the Services, and send us information, at your own risk.</p>\n<p>If you correspond with us by e-mail, text message, or using a \u201cContact us\u201d feature on our Service, a third party could view the information you send in transit by such means.\nWe have no liability relating to disclosure of your information due to errors, omissions or unauthorized acts or failures to act by third parties during or after transmission.</p>\n<p>If you create an account on our Services, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any activity, including disclosure of your Personal Information, that occurs using your account credentials, whether or not you authorized such activity.\nPlease notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.</p>\n<p>We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach.\nIf we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our care may have been compromised, we will endeavor to notify you of that development promptly taking into consideration the circumstances.\nIf we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.\nWhere legally required to do so, we also will notify any applicable regulator.</p>\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nCookies and other tracking technologies\n<p>We, and/or our service providers or partners on our behalf, may use tracking technologies which may run on your device when you use the Services.\nThe circumstances in which we may deploy tracking technologies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may use cookies or local shared objects, such as \u201cFlash

your interactions with the Service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or our service providers or partners on our behalf.\nThese technologies enable us to assign a unique number to your computer or device, and relate information about your use of the Services to other information about you, including your Personal Information.\nThese technologies also enable us to recognize you when you access our Services using different web browsers or devices.</p>\n<p>You can manage website cookies in your browser settings.\nYou always have the choice to have your device

social media and other external platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter.\nWe may occasionally incorporate third party social networking features into our Services.\nThis Privacy Policy applies to our use of information you submit to us there, but it does not apply to what those third-party platforms do with your information.</p>\n<p>Our Services may allow you to share information with us that you have already provided to a third party social networking platform.\nFor example, you may be able to create an account on our Service or log in to our Service using your Facebook account or other

may result in their ability to identify you.\nIn addition, when you choose to share information about your activities on the Service with certain social media platforms, AP may send technical information about you to that platform as well as information about what content you are viewing.</p>\n<p>Our Service may contain links, banners, widgets, or advertisements that lead to third-party
