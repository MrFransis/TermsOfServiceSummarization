Services</strong>\u201d).\nThese Terms and any Order Form together form a binding \u201c<strong>Contract</strong>\u201d between Customer and us.\n\u201cCustomer\u201d is the organization that you

and us (\u201c<strong>Order Form</strong>\u201d).\nin so doing, you agree to the then-current Contract on behalf of Customer.\nFree Services may be made available without an Order Form.\nCustomer represents and warrants that it has validly entered into the Contract and has the legal power to do so.\nSubscriptions commence when we make them available to Customer and continue for the term specified in the Order Form.\nfees are specified in the Order Form.\nThe foregoing sentence does not apply to Free Services, which are described below.</p>\n<p>We will make available the Services, or may make available the Free Services, in accordance with these Terms, the Documentation, and the Data Processing Addendum.\nAll of our rights not expressly granted by these Terms are hereby retained.</p>\n<p>Customer may make data, including personal data, available to the Services (\u201c<strong>Customer Data</strong>\u201d).\nCustomer grants us a worldwide, limited-term license to host, copy, use, transmit, and display Customer Data or any Third-Party Apps created by or for Customer.\nSubject to the limited licenses granted herein, we acquire no right, title, or interest from Customer in or to any Customer Data.</p>\n<p>Customer is responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of Customer Data, the means by which Customer acquired Customer Data, and its use of Customer Data with the Services or any Third-Party App.\nCustomer will ensure that all necessary rights and permissions are established for the transfer and/or processing of Customer Data in connection with the Services or the applicable Third-Party App in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and self-regulatory requirements.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We will maintain appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Customer Data, including measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of Customer Data.\nAdherence to security best practices obliges us to provide end-user authentication, in addition to other technical measures, as required, where the end user (e.g., customer of Customer) will engage directly with the Services (including, e.g., via two-factor authentication, downloading, or logging-in to the Services), as further described in the Documentation.\nCustomer will not attempt to use the Services, or ask us to configure the Services, in a manner inconsistent with these requirements.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Subject to the limited rights

Third-Party Apps.\nAny use of Third-Party Apps is solely between Customer and the applicable provider.\nWe are not responsible for any use, disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data that is transmitted to, or accessed by, a Third-Party App.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The Contract remains effective until all subscriptions have expired or been terminated or the Contract itself

equal to one (1) year.\nEither party can give the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of a subscription term.</p>\n<p>We or Customer may terminate the Contract on notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches the Contract and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after the non-breaching party provides notice of the breach.\nWe may suspend the Services or terminate the Contract immediately on notice to Customer if we believe the Services are being used in violation of applicable law or in a way that may cause risk of litigation or otherwise be harmful to us.\nIn no event will termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.\nFollowing termination or expiration of subscriptions, we will have no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Data.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Free Services are provided to Customer without charge up to certain limits as described in the Documentation.\nCustomer hereby acknowledges that usage over these limits requires Customer\u2019s purchase of additional resources or services.\nCustomer agrees that we may, in our sole discretion and for any or no reason, terminate Customer\u2019s access to the Free Services or any part thereof.\nCustomer agrees that any termination of Customer\u2019s access to the Free Services may be without prior notice, and Customer agrees that we will not be liable to Customer or any third party for such termination.\nCustomer is solely responsible for exporting Customer Data from the Free Services prior to termination of Customer\u2019s access to the Free Services for any reason, provided that if we terminate Customer\u2019s account, except as required by law we will provide Customer a reasonable opportunity to retrieve its Customer Data.\nWe may change the limits that apply to Customer\u2019s use of the Free Services at any time in our sole discretion without notice to Customer, regardless of whether or not these are used in conjunction with other products or services for which Customers pays us a fee.\nWe may make changes to the Free Services that
