carefully.\nTo confirm your understanding and acceptance of the Agreement, click \u201cAgree.\u201d</p>\n<p>A.\nINTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES</p>\n<p>This Agreement governs your use of Apple\u2019s services (\u201cServices\u201d), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to content, Apps (as defined below), and other in-app services (collectively, \u201cContent\u201d).\nContent may be offered through the Services by Apple or a third party.\nOur Services are available for your use in your country or territory of residence (\u201cHome Country\u201d).\nBy&nbsp;creating an account for use of the Services in a particular country or territory you are specifying it as your Home Country.\nTo use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply).\nOur Services\u2019 performance may be affected by these factors.</p>\n<p>B.\nUSING OUR SERVICES</p>\n<p>PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS</p>\n<p>You can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a \u201cTransaction.\u201d Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services.\nHowever, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd.\nis the merchant of record for the Content you acquire from certain Services (e.g., Apple Books, App Store, etc.) as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Service.\nIn such case, you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., which is licensed by the Content provider (e.g., App Provider (as defined below), book publisher, etc.).\nWhen you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions.\nIf you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial recognition.\nManage your password settings at any time by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/HT204030.\nApple will charge your selected payment method (such as your credit card, debit card, gift card/code, or other method available in your Home Country) for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes.\nIf you have also added it to your Apple Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple Wallet using Apple Pay.\nIf we cannot charge your selected payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method again as you may update your payment method information.\nIf you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content\u2019s availability).\nIn accordance with local law, Apple may update information regarding your selected payment method if provided such information by your financial institution.\nFor details about how Transactions are billed, please visit http://support.apple.com/HT5582.\nAll Transactions are final.\nContent prices may change at any time.\nIf technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple.\nFrom time to time, Apple may refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim.\nTerms related to Store Credit and gift cards/codes are available here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/.</p>\n<p>ACCOUNT&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Using our Services and accessing your Content may require an Apple

prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period.\nIf we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information.\nThis may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period.&nbsp.\nWe reserve the right to cancel your Paid Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription.&nbsp.\nCertain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method.\nIf you decide to unsubscribe from a

External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services.\nData displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical

Liability.\nTO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED
