\u201cour,\u201d or \u201cDIY\u201d) knows that you care about how your Personal Information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.\nWe are committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our site and applications, and have drafted this policy in accordance with the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d).\nFor more information about COPPA and general tips about protecting children\u2019s online privacy, please visit&nbsp;<strong>OnGuard Online</strong>.</p>\n<p>Please read the following to learn more about how we use your Personal Information.\nBy visiting, accessing or using the&nbsp;<strong>http://diy.org</strong>&nbsp;website, and any other linked pages, features, content, or application services (including mobile applications) offered by DIY in connection therewith (collectively, \u201cDIY\u201d), or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?<p>This Privacy Policy covers DIY\u2019s treatment of personally identifiable information (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d) that DIY gathers when you access DIY and when you use DIY\u2019s services.\nThis policy does not apply to the practices of companies that DIY does not own or control (including any third-party products or services used for logging into DIY or that are integrated with the DIY), or to individuals that DIY does not employ or manage.\nDIY may contain links to other sites.\nDIY is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites.\nWhen linking to another site a user should read the privacy policy stated on that site.</p>What Personal Information Does DIY Collect?<p>The information we gather from users enables us to provide, personalize and improve our services, and allows our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to personalize their experience on DIY and interact with other users through the site.\nIn connection with DIY, we request and display some Personal Information to other users and visitors of DIY, which allows users to identify one another.\nWe collect the following types of information from our users:</p>Personal Information You Provide to Us:<p>During the account registration process, we receive and store the following information: full name of the parent or guardian, full name of the child, parent\u2019s email address, a password for the parental account, a password for the child account, and the child\u2019s birthdate (to verify their age).</p>\n<p>In addition, children choose an \u201cavatar\u201d and username (\u201cnickname\u201d) which will represent them on the service.\nWe encourage children to use our anonymous nickname generator.\nConsistent with the requirements of COPPA, we collect a parent or guardian email address before we collect any Personal Information from a child.</p>\n<p>We collect credit card information for verification purposes but do not store that information on our servers.\nWe\u2019ve partnered with Stripe to help make verification and payments easier and safer.\nStripe meets and exceeds the most stringent industry standards for security.\nYou can learn more about the technical details of Stripe's secure infrastructure&nbsp;<strong>here</strong>.\nDIY does not store full credit card numbers, but instead, only the last four digits and expiration date.</p>\n<p>For contests and sweepstakes, we typically require only the information necessary for a child to participate, such as first name (to distinguish among family members) and parent email address (to notify the parent where required by law).\nWe only contact the parent for more personalized information (such as a mailing address) for prize-fulfillment purposes when the child wins the contest or sweepstakes.</p>\n<p>DIY does not intentionally collect any Personal Information from children other than the information set out above.\nHowever, as part of the functionality of our service, we allow child accounts to upload certain content to the site, including photos, videos, and comments.\nWe take measures to prevent children from communicating Personal Information through these features, but we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of these measures.\nIf you use these features to disclose personally identifiable information, you should be aware that such information could be read, collected, or used by other users and/or third parties.\nYou agree not to provide any personally identifiable information through these features, and we are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you provide using these features.</p>\n<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to create an account or take advantage of many of DIY\u2019s &nbsp;special features.\nThe Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as obtaining parental consent as set forth above, providing parents with notice of our privacy practices, answering questions, improving the content of DIY, responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, attribution for content you submit, customizing the advertising and content you see, allowing you to communicate with other users, and communicating with you about DIY\u2019s products and services, including specials and new features.</p>Personal Information Collected Automatically:<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with DIY or use our services.\nDIY automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, browser information, operating system, timezone, device ID, the pages you request, and the actions and path you take on DIY.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to DIY and how they use its various components.\nDIY only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.\nThis type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how users use parts of DIY or services so that we can make DIY appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services.\nAs part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use DIY or services.\nWe share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how people use DIY or services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.\nAgain, DIY never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from DIY if your computer or device supports this type of functionality.\nDIY uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and to improve DIY and our services.\nYou can opt out of these communications by sending us an email at help@diy.org.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>More About Cookies:<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer\u2019s (or other device\u2019s) persistent storage medium (e.g., hard drive) through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.\nWe use cookies to enhance visitors\u2019 experiences, to learn more about their use of DIY and to improve quality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.\nWe strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of DIY\u2019s most attractive features.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>Will DIY Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?<p>Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business.\nWe neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone.\nTo be absolutely clear, we do not and will not sell your, or your child\u2019s data.</p>With respect to a child\u2019s Personal Information:<ul>\n<li>\n<p>DIY will not send Personal Information about a child to other companies or people, except when: we have a parent\u2019s consent to share the information or we are required to do so to comply with the law, including for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena.\nto enforce our Terms of Service, or site rules.\nor to protect the safety and security of our users and site.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If DIY, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that DIY goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nAs set forth below, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of DIY may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User profile information including users\u2019 nickname and avatar, email address, and other information you enter (\u201cUser Submissions\u201d), may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within DIY.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>With respect to Personal Information other than a child\u2019s Personal Information:<p>\n<strong>We share such Personal Information only as described below.</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Advertisers: We may allow advertisers to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and you agree that we may use any of the information we have collected from you (including, without limitation, information you may have decided not to show to other users) to select or allow the advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements.\nFor example, we may allow an advertiser to target an ad to you based on your query history.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them.\nIn certain situations, these businesses may sell items to you through DIY.\nIn other situations, DIY may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses.\nYou can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Service Providers: We engage third party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., software maintenance services, advertising serving technologies, e-mail service providers, delivery services, database management, web analytics, payment processing and other services).\nThese third parties have access to your information so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are prohibited by us from using or disclosing your information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance, except to the extent required by law.\nWe may permit our service providers to use aggregate information which does not identify you or de-identified data for other purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.\nIn these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred.\nMoreover, if DIY, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that DIY goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nYou acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of DIY or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Protection of DIY and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the any applicable law, regulation or other legal requirement.\nenforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements.\nor protect the rights, property, or safety of DIY, our employees, our users, or others.\nThis includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>Is Personal Information About me Secure?<p>Your child\u2019s DIY account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.\nYou need to ensure that there is no unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer (or other device) and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.\nDIY endeavors to protect user information to ensure that user account information is kept private, however, DIY cannot guarantee the security of user account information.\nUnauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>\n<p>DIY contains links to other sites.\nDIY is not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites.\nWhen linking to another site you should read the privacy policy stated on that site.\nThis Privacy Policy only governs information collected on DIY.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post information to public areas on DIY or any other public forums, such information can be accessed by the public.</p>What Personal Information can I access?<p>DIY allows you to access the following information about you for the purpose of viewing, and in certain situations, updating or deleting that information.\nThis list will change as DIY changes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Real (full) name of parent and child</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Account and user profile information</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User e-mail address</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Username and password</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User preferences</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Billing preferences</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Parents may review information relating to their child\u2019s account at any time by logging on to the Parent Portal section of the website.</p>\n<p>A parent can also contact our customer service department to access, change, or delete Personal Information by sending an e-mail to help@diy.org.</p>\n<p>Please note that Personal Information about a child may remain in backup storage for up to two weeks after a request for deletion of that child\u2019s data.\nThis may be the case even though no information about that account remains in our active user databases.</p>When does DIY obtain Parental Consent?<p>\n<strong>Consent by purchase</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In order to participate in DIY, a parent or guardian must purchase access by providing their credit card information (note: \u201cFree Trials\u201d are considered \u201cpurchases\u201d for the purpose of consent).\nIn so doing, the parent or guardian grants us permission to collect necessary Personal Information from their child.\nThis kind of credit card verification is in compliance with COPPA and ensures an adult is the one signing a child up for DIY.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Content generated by a child</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Certain activities on our sites and applications allow children to create or manipulate content (like photos, videos and comments) and save it within DIY.\nBy registering and creating an account for your child on DIY, you grant us permission to share your child\u2019s content within DIY, and to share your child\u2019s content publicly on our social media channels as long as it does not contain Personal Information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Teacher consent in lieu of a parent</strong>\n</p>\n<p>With regard to school-based activities, COPPA allows teachers and school administrators to act in the stead of parents to provide consent for the collection of Personal Information from children.\nSchools should always notify parents about these activities.\nFor more information on parental rights with respect to a child\u2019s educational record under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), please visit the FERPA site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Comment System</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Certain activities allow users to communicate directly with other users by means of a comment system.\nIn most cases, these chat systems employ filters that are intended to prevent the communication of both Personal Information and age-inappropriate words and phrases.\nIn addition to filters, we may employ live moderation and/or encourage other users to flag inappropriate communications.\nWe strongly encourage children who use these interactive features on our sites and applications never to provide Personal Information about themselves or any third party, and certainly never to attempt to circumvent our filters or moderation.\nWe also recommend that parents carefully supervise their children when the children participate in online activities.</p>\n<p>Where DIY employs a comment system that does not filter out Personal Information, we will first seek high-level consent from the parent.</p>When will DIY e-mail me?<p>We may use your contact information to send emails to you about DIY and other related topics that may be of interest to users of DIY.\nYou can opt out of these communications by sending us an email at help@diy.org.</p>\n<p>As part of DIY\u2019s services, you will receive email and other communication relating to your child\u2019s User Submissions.\nYou acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Submissions, DIY may send you email and other communication that it determines in its sole discretion to be related to your User Submissions.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of DIY, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p>When will DIY e-mail my child?<p>On occasion, in order to respond to a question or request from a child, DIY may need to ask for the child\u2019s online contact information, such as an email address.\nDIY will delete this information immediately after responding to the question or request.</p>\n<p>In connection with certain activities or services, we may collect a child\u2019s online contact information, such as an email address, in order to communicate with the child more than once.\nIn such instances we will retain the child\u2019s online contact information to honor the request and for no other purpose such as marketing.\nOne example would be a newsletter that provides occasional updates about an activity.\nWhenever we collect a child\u2019s online contact information for ongoing communications, we will simultaneously require a parent email address in order to notify the parent about the collection and use of the child\u2019s information, as well as to provide the parent an opportunity to prevent further contact with the child.\nOn some occasions a child may be engaged in more than one ongoing communication, and a parent may be required to \u201copt-out\u201d of each communication individually.</p>Changes to this Privacy Policy<p>DIY may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nUse of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.\nIf we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on DIY or sending you an email.\nUsers are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when he or she uses DIY after such changes have been first posted.</p>Questions or Concerns<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy on DIY, please send a detailed message to DIY via email at&nbsp;help@diy.org&nbsp;or contact us at</p>\n<p>\n<strong>KYT TECHNOLOGIES PTE.\nLTD.<br>Attn: Compliance<br>#14-04, 160 Robinson Road<br>Singapore
