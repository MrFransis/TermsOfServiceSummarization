Monitoring Tools: Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.\nWe may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called \u201ctracking pixels\u201d or \u201cclear gifs\u201d) to better tailor the Site in order to provide a better service.\nThese are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Site.\nThese technologies usually work in conjunction with cookies.\nTo disable cookies used on our Site, and therefore any other tracking technologies that work in conjunction with these cookies, please follow the instructions above.</p>\n<br>\n<p>IP Address: Your IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider.\nAn IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.\nCollecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many online service providers, including website operators.\nWe use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Social Media Plug-Ins: We use social media plug-ins from social media networks like Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, which are labeled on our Site with the well-known symbols of the respective social network.\nIf you interact with these plug-ins, your activity on

you with additional detail about our current approach to information collected from passive technologies.</p>\n<br>\n<p>5.\n<u>INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING</u>.\n</p>\n<p>We may collect information about your online activities on our Site and when you interact with our email advertisements.\nWe use this information to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests.\nWe also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our ads are served.\nIn addition, we work with third party service providers who use their own automated information collection and tracking technologies on our Site.\nThis section of our Notice provides details and explains how to exercise your choices.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>You may see certain ads on other websites because we work with advertising partners (including advertising networks) to engage in remarketing and retargeting activities.\nOur advertising partners allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means.\nThese partners track your online activities over time and across websites by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of third-party cookies, web server logs, and web beacons.\nThey use this information to show you advertisements that may be tailored to your individual interests.\nThe information our advertising partners may collect includes data about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.\nThis data collection takes place both on our Site and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks, as well as when you interact with our email advertisements.\nThis process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nFor example, we utilize certain of our ad partners\u2019 targeted advertising services to show you our ads on other websites based on your prior visits to our Site and other online activity.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Provided that a company participates in industry-developed programs designed to provide consumers choices about whether to receive targeted advertising, you may opt out of ad network interest-based advertising generally through the Network Advertising Initiative website or by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ (web-based advertising) or http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices (for mobile advertising).\nTo learn more, please visit the websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance at www.networkadvertising.org/choices.\nOpting-out does not mean that you will stop receiving ads from us.\nIt means that you still stop receiving ads from us that have been targeted to you based on your visits and browsing activity across websites over time.</p>\n<br>\n<p>6.\n<u>Social Media</u>.\n</p>\n<p>Some aspects of the Site may allow you to interface with other websites, social media, and other online services, such as Facebook and Twitter.\nWe will diligently work to identify these aspects of the Site to you, for example, by identifying them with the applicable third party logos or trade names.\nBy using these interfaces, you will allow us to access information about you from those other online services, including information and other content that you submit to those online services.\nThese interfaces may also allow the social media or other service to automatically collect information about you, such as browser information and IP address.\nIf you interface with the Site through your social media account, we may contact you or enable you to share your experience and content via your social media account, which information may be publicly viewed by other users of those services.\nFor a description on how such social media services and other third-party platforms, plug-ins, integrations, and applications handle your information, please refer to their respective privacy policies and terms of use, which may permit you to modify your privacy settings with that service or platform.</p>\n<br>\n<p>7.\n<u>SECURITY</u>.\n</p>\n<p>We take what we believe to be reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information collected by us from loss, misuse, unauthorized use, access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration, and destruction.\nHowever, no network, server, database, or Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure, error-free, or \u201chacker proof.\u201d Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you provide to us.\nPlease keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Information.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>8.\n<u>DATA RETENTION</u>.\n</p>\n<p>We generally retain Personal Information for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes above, or for longer when required by law.\nTo dispose of Personal Information, we may anonymize it, delete it, or take other appropriate steps.\nEven if we delete your Personal Information, it may persist on backup or archival media for an additional period of time for legal, tax, or regulatory reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.</p>\n<br>\n<p>9.\n<u>YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES</u>.\n</p>\n<p>Opt Out From Direct Electronic Communications </p>\n<br>\n<p>Where it

Processing </p>\n<br>\n<p>You can opt out from certain cookie-related processing as described in Sections 4 of this Notice.</p>\n<br>\n<p>10.\n<u>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</u>\n</p>\n<p>The Site may contain links to other web sites for the convenience of users in locating information or services that may be of interest.\nIf you access a third-party website from a link on the Site, any information you disclose on that website is not subject to this Notice.\nIt is possible that these links may be used by third parties or others to collect personal or other information about you.\nPortable.TV is not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites, advertisers, or third parties or the content of such websites.\nPortable.TV does not control these third parties\u2019 use of cookies, collection of information, or how they manage such information.\nIt is solely your obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other websites, advertisers and any third parties.</p>\n<br>\n<p>11.\n<u>CALIFORNIA</u>\n</p>\n<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as the \u201cShine The Light\u201d law) permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year.\nAlternatively, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose Personal Information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes unless the customer has opted-in to such information sharing.\nAccordingly, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties other than our affiliates for the third party\u2019s own direct marketing purposes unless you opt-in, for example by checking a consent check box when providing us with your information.</p>\n<br>\n<p>12.\n<u>UPDATES DELETING YOUR PORTABLE.TV ACCOUNT</u>\n</p>\n<p>You may delete

Procedures</u>.</p>\n<br>\n<p>14.1.\nIf you believe that any content or postings on the Site violates your intellectual property or other rights, please send to us at support@portable.tv a comprehensive detailed message setting forth the following information: (a) your name and the name of your company, if any.\n(b) your contact information, including your e-mail address.\n(c) the nature and substance of your complaint, the specific rights at issue, and your basis for making the complaint, including the content or posting that is objectionable.\nand (d) the following statement: \u201cThe statements, representations, and assertions made in this message are true, complete, and accurate and I have the full legal authority to make each and every such statement, representation, and assertion and to make and be granted any demand made in this message.\u201d </p>\n<br>\n<p>15.\n<u>Dispute Resolution</u>.</p>\n<br>\n<p>15.1.\nAny dispute arising out of these Terms of Use shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the \u201cAAA\u201d).\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.\nand an arbitrator must also follow the terms of these Terms, as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability and the scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\nArbitration shall take place in Washington, DC, unless We elect otherwise.</p>\n<br>\n<p>15.2.\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to any conflict-of-law rules or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.\nThe arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Site users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Site user to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nPayment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration.\nAny request for payment of fees by Us should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your demand for arbitration and We will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of accessing arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of accessing a court for purposes of pursuing litigation on an individual basis, we will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the costs of accessing arbitration from being prohibitive.\nIn the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Us on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA\u2019s rules.\nIf an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this agreement to arbitrate shall still apply.</p>\n<br>\n<p>15.3.\nYou can choose to reject this agreement to arbitrate by mailing Us a written opt-out notice (\u201cOpt-Out Notice\u201d).\nThe Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty days after the date you accept these Terms of Use for the first time.\nYou must complete the Opt-Out Notice form by providing the information called for in the form, including your name, address (including street number and address, city, state, and zip code), phone number, and the email address used to log in to the G.\nBrown account to which the opt-out applies.\nYou must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective.\nThis procedure is the only way you can opt out of the agreement to arbitrate.\nIf you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, all other parts of these Terms of Use will continue to apply.\nOpting out of this agreement to arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with Us.</p>\n<br>\n<p>16.\n<u>Governing Law</u>.</p>\n<br>\n<p>16.1.\nWithout limiting the terms of Section 15, these Terms and use of the Site are governed by the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to Washington, DC conflict of laws rules.\nIf the arbitration agreement is deemed unenforceable or void, you irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in Washington, DC, for purposes of any legal action arising out of or related to the use of the Site or these Terms.</p>\n<br>\n<p>17.\n<u>Miscellaneous</u>.</p>\n<br>\n<p>17.1.\nThe Site is

available on the Site.\nYou agree that Portable.TV is under no obligation to provide you with notices regarding changes to the Terms.\nYou understand that it is your responsibility to check the Terms regularly for changes.</p>\n<br>\n<p>17.3.\nThe failure of Portable.TV to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms will not operate as a waiver of any such right or provision.\nThe section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nThe invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Terms does not affect or impair in any way the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein.\nNo person or entity not party to this agreement will be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of these Terms or any provision hereof.\nWhen used herein, the words \u201cincludes\u201d and \u201cincluding\u201d and their syntactical variations shall be deemed followed by the words \u201cwithout limitation.</p>\n<br>\n<p>17.4.\nIf you have any questions about the Terms, write to</p>\n<br>\n<p> Portable.TV<br>\n</p>\n<p> c/o T&amp;R Productions, LLC<br>\n</p>\n<p> Email us at:
