Action Waiver (\u201c<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>\u201d) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and BigCommerce.\nFor the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, \u201cBigCommerce\u201d means BigCommerce, Inc., a Texas corporation, and each of its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.\nThis Arbitration Agreement applies to these Terms and any other agreement you may have with BigCommerce.\n<p>\n</p> Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their disputes and potential disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.\nYou have the right to opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.\n<p>\n</p> Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.\nIt provides that all disputes between you and BigCommerce will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration replaces the right to go to court.\nIn the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).\nEntering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nThe arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney\u2019s fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law).\n<p>\n</p> The term \u201c<strong>Dispute</strong>\u201d means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and BigCommerce regarding any aspect of your relationship with BigCommerce, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).\n\u201cDispute\u201d is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.</strong> For all Disputes you must first give BigCommerce an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.\nYou must commence this process by mailing written notification to:<p>\n</p>\n<p>Legal Department<br> BigCommerce, Inc.<br> 11305 Four Points Drive<br> Building II, Third Floor<br> Austin, TX 78726</p>\n<p>\n</p> That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of the Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.\nIf BigCommerce does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong> If this Arbitration Agreement applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (\u201c<strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</strong>\u201d) either you or BigCommerce may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nThe American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.\nThe arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration.\nAll issues will be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement.\n<p>\n</p> For arbitration before the AAA, the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and&nbsp;the AAA\u2019s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection will apply.\nThe AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nFor arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.\nThe JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.\nThis Arbitration Agreement governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.\nUnder no circumstances will class action, representative action, or collective action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.\n<p>\n</p> Because your contract with BigCommerce, these Terms, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201c<strong>FAA</strong>\u201d), if applicable, governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.\nHowever, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out.</strong> Notwithstanding the above, you or BigCommerce may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if <strong>(a)</strong> the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court&nbsp;or equivalent in the applicable jurisdiction.\nor <strong>(b)</strong> YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the \u201c<strong>Opt-Out Deadline</strong>\u201d).\nYou may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to<p>\n</p>\n<p>Legal Department<br> BigCommerce, Inc.<br> 11305 Four Points Drive<br> Building II, Third Floor<br> Austin, TX 78726</p>\n<p>\n</p> Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with BigCommerce through arbitration.\nYour decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with BigCommerce.\nAny opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration Award.</strong> The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award will be in writing, will be signed by the arbitrator, and will include a determination of all the questions submitted to the arbitrator the decision of which is necessary in order to determine the controversy.\nSuch award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by law, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location of Arbitration.</strong> You may initiate arbitration in the federal judicial district that includes your address that you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution.\nIn the event that BigCommerce initiates an arbitration, it may only do so in the federal judicial district that includes your address that you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution or the billing address for your account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs.</strong> BigCommerce will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator\u2019s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.\nYou are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.\nFees and costs may be awarded by the arbitrator as provided pursuant to applicable law.\nIn addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with BigCommerce as provided in the \u201cPre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution\u201d Section and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover from BigCommerce your actual and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> The parties agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and BigCommerce specifically agree in writing to do so following initiation of the arbitration.\nNeither you, nor any other user of the Services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Limitation of Procedural Rights.</strong> You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and BigCommerce are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court.\nIn the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and BigCommerce might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).\nYou give up those rights, to the extent permitted by applicable law.\nOther rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration.\nThe right to appellate review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator\u2019s decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability.</strong> If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect.\nIf the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Continuation.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your contract with BigCommerce and your use of the Services.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<li>\n<strong>Anti-Corruption, Export and Sanctions Compliance.</strong>With respect to these Terms, you represent, warrant, and covenant that you:<ol>\n<li> have not and will not violate, or cause any party to be in violation of, any applicable
