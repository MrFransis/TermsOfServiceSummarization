&nbsp.\nDo We Disclose Any of Your Personal Information to Outside Parties? Third Party Providers <p>We are assisted by trusted third parties to operate our website, to conduct our business, and to provide you with our services.\nSuch third party providers include billing companies, website infrastructure management, and analytics service providers.\nAs part of the provision of their services to us, we may transfer some of your personal information to them, inasmuch as such personal information is necessary for them to perform such service.\nFor example: your credit card details will be analyzed through our billing software which is provided by a third party in order for us to provide you with an invoice when you make a purchase on our website.</p>\n<p>These third party providers are located in:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The European Union;</li>\n<li>Israel \u2013 which has been granted an adequacy decision by the European Commission, meaning that its data privacy legislation is considered to provide an equivalent level of protection to personal data as provided within the European Union and thus data transfers to Israel do not require an additional transfer mechanisms;</li>\n<li>The United States \u2013 Data processing agreements are provided to sub-contractors in the US, which include the Standard Contractual Clauses formulated by the European commission to assure that adequate safeguards are implemented to secure any data transfer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We also entered into contracts with such third party providers in order to ensure that the personal information we provide them regarding our users is kept confidential and secure.</p> Other Forms of Disclosure <p>In certain circumstances, we may also disclose your personal information to outside parties.\nThis could happen if:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We believe that, under the specific circumstances, releasing such personal information will be appropriate in order to comply with any European Union or Member State law applicable to us;</li>\n<li>We want to protect our legitimate interest and in order to do so we would need to disclose your personal information, and only after we made sure that we cannot protect our interest without disclosing your personal information;</li>\n<li>We need to protect your or another individual\u2019s vital interests.</li>\n</ol> &nbsp.\nThird Party Links <p>Occasionally, and at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website.\nThese third party websites have separate and independent privacy policies and should be researched independently by anyone wishing to use their services.\nAlthough we are not responsible for the content and activities of such third party websites, we do seek to protect the integrity of our website, and would thus welcome your feedback regarding such websites if you have any concerns you wish to share with us.</p> &nbsp.\nData Protection <p>Powtoon operates a rigorous information security management system and protects data according to industry best practices.\nWe have implemented, and work to constantly improve, a wide array of processes, procedures, and technical controls such as encryption, firewalls, and segregation of networks.\nAll this is done to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all our users' data.</p> &nbsp.\nPrivacy of Children Compliance <p>We are proud that Powtoon is a tool widely used in schools by children of all ages.\nAs such, we are committed to safeguarding each child\u2019s personal information, in compliance with but not limited to the following laws and regulations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</li>\n<li>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</li>\n<li>The New York State Education Law 2-d</li>\n</ul> Student accounts <p>To protect children's privacy, their accounts are labeled internally at Powtoon as <em>student accounts</em> and are subject to all the requirements of the above laws.\nSpecifically, with regards to personal information, our approach is to not collect or store personal information belonging to children that created a student account.</p>\n<p>Student accounts are created when children sign up for our service in one of the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By using their clever.com account</li>\n<li>By accepting an invitation from a teacher to join a Powtoon classroom group</li>\n<li>By signing up on our dedicated student signup page</li>\n<li>By signing up on our dedicated education signup page and choosing the student option in the signup form</li>\n<li>By accessing Powtoon through their school's learning management system (for example: Canvas)</li>\n</ul> No commercial use of data <p>Student account data is used exclusively to deliver Powtoon's services.\nNo commercial use of student data is made.</p> Communications <p>To student accounts with email addresses (Google G Suite for Education), Powtoon will send only transactional emails that provide notification for events such as the completion of a video rendering process.</p>\n<p>All transactional notifications from Powtoon to student account holders without email addresses take the form of on-site notifications.\nPowtoon refrains from sending any marketing or other non-transactional email messages to student account holders.</p> Access to content created in student accounts <p>Videos and presentations created by student account holders and which are published for viewing on the Powtoon platform, are published in private mode by default.\nThese videos and presentations are not added to the Powtoon site map and not made available for indexing by search engines.</p> Google G Suite accounts for education <p>Many schools use Google G Suite for Education to issue \"school use only\" Google accounts to their students.\nThese students may use their Google account to sign up for Powtoon on the education signup page.\nPowtoon will protect such accounts from disclosure and will use the email address associated with such accounts only for sending transactional email messages.</p> Data breach prevention and response plan <p>Data of children is, like all other data Powtoon controls, safeguarded according to industry standards and best practices.\nFor more details, see Data Protection above.\nFurthermore, we make every reasonable effort to prevent data breaches and have a documented security incident management policy and procedure.</p>\n<p>As we do not collect personal information from students, the risk of personal student information being extracted from our system is very low.\nIf you want to be informed in the event of a data breach that affects student account data, you can register your institution to our breach notification list by emailing edu-privacy@powtoon.com with the subject line \"registration to breach notification list\".\nIn this email, please include the name of your institution, your name and role, together with your contact information.\nIn the unlikely event that such a breach will occur, we will inform all registered institutions within 72 hours of detecting the breach.</p> &nbsp.\nChanges to This Privacy Policy <p>This privacy policy was last modified on October 12, 2020.\nIf we update this privacy policy in a manner which changes how we collect or use your personal information, the types of personal information we collect or use, or the purposes for such collection or use of personal information, we will ask for your renewed consent.\nThis will be conducted in two steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We will

consent;</li>\n<li>Following the email notification, we will ask you to provide your consent to the new changes when you next log in to our website.</li>\n</ol> &nbsp.\nYour Rights Right to Lodge a
