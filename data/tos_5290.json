Protocol.\n</p>\n<p>This Terms of Service Agreement (the \u201dAgreement\u201d) explains the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Interface.\nYou must read this Agreement carefully.\nBy accessing or using the Interface, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety.\nIf you do not agree, you are not authorized to

blockchain.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Non-Solicitation.\nNo Investment Advice</p>\n<p>You agree and understand that all trades you submit through the Interface are considered unsolicited, which means

you submit.\n</p>\n<p>All information provided by the Interface is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice.\nYou should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information contained in the Interface.\nWe do not make any investment recommendations to you or opine on the merits of any investment transaction or opportunity.\nYou alone are responsible for determining whether any investment, investment strategy or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances, and risk tolerance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No Warranties</p>\n<p>The Interface is provided on an \u201dAS IS\u201d and \u201dAS AVAILABLE\u201d basis.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim any representations and warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including (but not limited to) the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.\nYou acknowledge and agree that your use of the Interface is at your own risk.\nWe do not represent or warrant that access to the Interface will be continuous, uninterrupted, timely, or secure.\nthat the information contained in the Interface will be accurate, reliable, complete, or current.\nor that the Interface will be free from errors, defects, viruses, or other harmful elements.\nNo advice, information, or statement that we make should be treated as creating any warranty concerning the Interface.\nWe do not endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any advertisements, offers, or statements made by third parties concerning the Interface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties</p>\n<p>The Interface is a purely non-custodial application, meaning you are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold.\nThis Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated.\nYou further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compliance Obligations</p>\n<p>The Interface is operated from facilities within the United States.\nThe Interface may not be available or appropriate for use in other jurisdictions.\nBy accessing or using the Interface, you agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations that may apply to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assumption of Risk</p>\n<p>By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you are financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and other digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20).\nIn particular, you understand that blockchain-based transactions are irreversible.\n</p>\n<p>You further understand that the markets for these digital assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation.\nYou acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may increase dramatically at any time.\nYou further acknowledge and accept the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol through the Interface, you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool, and, especially in expert modes, experience significant price slippage and cost.\nYou understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens.\nYou further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Interface.\nAccordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Interface to interact with the Protocol.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Third-Party Resources and Promotions</p>\n<p>The Interface may contain references or links to third-party resources, including (but not limited to) information, materials, products, or services, that we do not own or control.\nIn addition, third parties may offer promotions related to your access and use of the Interface.\nWe do not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such resources or promotions.\nIf you access any such resources or participate in any such promotions, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement does not apply to your dealings or relationships with any third parties.\nYou expressly relieve us of any and all liability arising from your use of any such resources or participation in any such promotions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Release of Claims</p>\n<p>You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of the Interface and your interaction with the Protocol.\nYou further expressly waive and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of the Interface and your interaction with the Protocol.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive the benefits and protections of California Civil Code \u00a7 1542, which provides: \u201d[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Indemnity</p>\n<p>You agree to hold harmless, release, defend, and indemnify us and our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and

agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible property, arising out of or relating to any access or use of the Interface, nor will we be responsible for any damage, loss, or injury resulting from hacking, tampering, or other unauthorized access or use of the Interface or the information contained within it.\nWe assume no liability or responsibility for any: (a) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content.\n(b) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from any access or use of the Interface.\n(c) unauthorized access or use of any secure server or database in our control, or the use of any information or data stored therein.\n(d) interruption or cessation of function related to the Interface.\n(e) bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the Interface.\n(f) errors or omissions in, or loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of, any content made available through the Interface.\nand (g) the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any third party.\nUnder no circumstances shall we or any of our officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, or subsidiaries be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses, or costs in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to us in exchange for access to and use of the Interface, or USD$100.00, whichever is greater.\nThis limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such liability.\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of certain liabilities and damages.\nAccordingly, some of the disclaimers and limitations set forth in this Agreement may not apply to you.\nThis limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dispute Resolution</p>\n<p>We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through informal, good faith negotiations.\nIf a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to legal@uniswap.org so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution.\nIf we aren\u2019t able to reach an informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then you and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set forth below.</p>\n<p>Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Interface, this Agreement, or any other acts or omissions for which you may contend that we are liable, including (but not limited to) any claim or controversy as to arbitrability (\u201dDispute\u201d), shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration under the JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures.\nYou understand that you are required to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration.\nThe arbitration shall be held on a confidential basis before a single arbitrator, who shall be selected pursuant to JAMS rules.\nThe arbitration will be held in New York, New York, unless you and we both agree to hold it elsewhere.\nUnless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any other party.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver</p>\n<p>You must bring any and all Disputes against us in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding.\nThis provision applies to class arbitration.\nYou and we both agree to waive the right to demand a trial by jury.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Governing Law</p>\n<p>You agree that the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, govern this Agreement and any Dispute between you and us.\nYou further agree that the Interface shall be deemed to be based solely in the State of New York, and that although the Interface may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the State of New York.\nAny arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\nYou agree that the federal and state courts of New York County, New York are the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the event that this Agreement\u2019s binding arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Entire Agreement </p>\n<p>These terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter hereof.\nThis Agreement supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings (if any) relating to the subject matter of the terms.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a9 2021 Uniswap</p>\n<ul>AboutDisclaimerTrademarksBrandGitHub</ul>",
