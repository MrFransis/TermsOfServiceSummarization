arbitration.\nFurther, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>GENERAL TERMS.\nThese Terms and any posted rules on the Services constitute the entire
