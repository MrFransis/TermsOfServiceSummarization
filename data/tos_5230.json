Policy applies to all information collected through the Sites and Apps, regardless of how you access the Sites or Apps.\nThat is to say, this Policy applies whether you are accessing our Sites on a computer or on a mobile device like a tablet, or phone.\nWe may also speak with you face to face (for example at a conference) or by telephone (for example when you make a support call).\nThose

Policy.</p>\n<p>This Policy does not apply to information collected through any third party products or services, even if resold by Zix.</p>\nPotential Applicability of Other Privacy Policies\n<p>You might use Zix Company Services through a web portal provided by us on behalf of our customer, such as your employer, healthcare provider or financial institution.\nIn that case, your employer, health care provider or financial institution likely also has its own privacy policy that applies to your use of the Zix Services, and both privacy policies apply to you in those situations.\nZix is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties.\nIf you are a data subject located in Europe, please see the section below entitled \u201cData Controller\u201d for more information on our relationship with our customers.</p>\nApplicability of Other Terms\n<p>Information collected by Zix through its password protected sites and through customer use of the Zix Company Services is also governed, to the extent applicable to the relevant Zix Company Services, by Zix\u2019s Terms and Conditions, Zix\u2019s License and Services Agreements for the applicable Services, Zix\u2019s End User

the Zix services.\nIn addition, Zix collects a variety of information about users and subscribers to Zix Services and about other individuals that send or receive email to or from such users and subscribers, including contacts, IP address, and relationships.\nThat information includes, without limitation, email address, Zix services passwords and passphrases, email message content, and information about Zix email accounts.\nWe also collect metadata about emails, such as header information (e.g., sender, recipient, time sent, to, from, cc, date, subject line), file structure, operating systems used, system components, and hardware used.\nThese types of metadata information are not encrypted by Zix because they are required for email delivery and analysis.\nThe content of email messages and attachments (including non- spam messages) will not always be encrypted if you use the advanced threat protection services, including but not limited to during spooling for delivery

directed by, our customers.\nThis information includes emails, texts, websites, social media messages or posts, and other forms of data or electronic communications.\nit also includes data about our customers and the third parties with whom they correspond.</p>\n<p>If you or your company uses ZixOne, we automatically collect the phone number of the device on which the application is accessed and compare it to the PIN you set to access the application.\nDepending on your company\u2019s arrangement with Zix, either Zix or your company (or their respective service providers) maintains the back-end servers that support ZixOne.\nZix or your company has the ability to determine which message(s) you are viewing when you use ZixOne.</p>\n<p>Our AppRiver SecureSurf\u00ae Service is designed to protect users from malware, allow employers to restrict employee access to inappropriate websites, and give employers the ability to track and collect the web histories of their employees.\nAs a result, we obtain a limited amount of web surfing history.</p>\n<p>If you choose to refer a friend or business entity to Zix, we will ask you for certain information about your friend or a contact at the business entity.\nWe may contact the referred party using the contact information you provide (such as by email, postal mail, landline phone, and mobile phone, as applicable).\nZix stores this information for its marketing purposes, to track the success of the referral program, and to determine our obligations under the referral program.\nIndividuals referred through our consumer referral program may contact us at privacy@zixcorp.com to request that we cease contacting the individual in connection with the referral program.</p>\n<p>When you request technical support, Zix collects your

demographic information (such as your state and country of residency), operating system, browser, Internet service provider (\u201cISP\u201d), connection type and email program that you are using.\nWe encourage you to provide the additional information so that we can determine specific regional problems (such as natural disasters or power outages caused by cuts through fiber optic cable) or isolate problems relating specifically to your particular operating system, email program or browser, thus enabling us to provide a more accurate response to your support requests.</p>\nInformation That We Automatically Collect\n<p>Zix automatically receives certain information about your device and how your device interacts with our Site.\nExamples of such information include your device\u2019s IP address and other device identifiers, device type, browser type (such as Chrome\u00ae, Firefox\u00ae, Internet Explorer\u00ae and Safari\u00ae), browser language, operating system, referring and exit page, pages visited, number of clicks, domain names, error reports, performance data, and time spent on our Site.\nWe use various current \u2013 and later \u2013 developed tracking technologies to collect this information, including cookies, web beacons, and embedded scripts.\nZix combines such information with other types of data it collects about you, such as your email address.\nZix treats any such combined information as personal information under applicable laws and will treat any such information in accordance with this Policy.</p>\nIP Address and Location Information\n<p>When your Web browser or email application requests content from another device on the Internet, it automatically gives that device the address where the requested information should be sent.\nThis is called your device's \u201cIP address.\u201d (IP stands for \u201cInternet Protocol.\u201d)</p>\n<p>Zix and our service providers receive your IP address each time you obtain content from the Site.\nWe use your IP address for various purposes, including diagnosing service or technology problems that are associated with your IP address, conducting analytics, and estimating the total number of users visiting the Site from specific locales, countries or regions of the world.\nAn IP address generally indicates a user\u2019s physical location.\nZix generally does not collect precise location data (such as GPS or mobile device coordinates).\nhowever, when you install certain Apps like Total Defense, you will be asked to grant access to your mobile device\u2019s geolocation data.\nIf you grant such permission, Zix collects information about your precise geolocation information (i.e., your real-time geographic location), and uses that information to provide or customize the Apps with location-based information and features.\nIP addresses and access times are linked to your email address, but this combined information is for our internal use only and is not shared with third parties.</p> Logs\n<p>When you request content from the Site, information related to that request is collected and stored in log files on our servers.\nThat information includes the date and time of the request, and the IP address of the device that requested the content.\nWe use log files for debugging, troubleshooting purposes and delivering messages using DeliverySlip messaging products.\nFor example, when you send or receive a message using DeliverySlip, we need to collect the content of that message to deliver it to an inbox, display it to the recipient, enable the ability to reply to it, and store it until the recipient decides to delete it.\nFor messaging functionality, we collect certain kinds of data, such as the content of communications sent or received including attachments such as files for e-signature or documents, photos, music, or videos and the subject line and body of a message.\nDeliverySlip encrypts attachments, e-signature documents and the body of messages at rest and transports the content of communications using HTTPS (TLS 1.1 or higher).</p>\nCookies\n<p>If you visit the Zix Sites, or use certain Zix Services, Zix and our service providers will set cookies and similar technologies on your computer and/or your mobile device and later access those cookies in order to deliver services.\nA cookie is a small text file, which often includes a unique identifier, which is sent to your browser when you visit a Web site.\nIt is then stored on your computer or mobile device.\nZix uses cookies to allow you to use certain functions when you use various Zix Company Services, and to engage in interest-based digital advertising as described below in the Section entitled \u201cAnalytics and Advertising.\u201d Please read our <strong>Cookie Notice</strong> for further information about the types of cookies we set including information about how to control or delete cookies.\nnote that our Cookie Notice does not apply to the Greenview Data or Erado services or websites, including but not limited to SpamStopsHere.</p>\n<p>If you do not accept cookies or disable these technologies, you will not be able to use all portions or functionality of our Sites and/or Services.</p> Web Beacons\n<p>Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as \"clear GIFs\"), which are invisible to you, are included in our web pages and e-mail messages.\nWeb beacons are used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.</p>\nEmbedded Scripts\n<p>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on.\nThe code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>\nInformation That Third Parties Provide About You\n<p>We receive information about you from third parties who are lawfully permitted to share your information with us.\nFor example, if you are on another web site and you provide information that the website operator indicates will be provided to Zix, that website operator will typically forward the information you provide.\nWe may contact you using the information you provided, in accordance with your communication preferences.\nWe also combine the information we receive from third parties with information we collect or already maintain in order to ensure the records we hold about you are accurate and up to date, among other things.\nFor example, if your company provides you with access credentials to the ZixOne App, we receive information about you from your company to provide you with access to the App and your related company Exchange account.\nWe combine information we receive from your company with information we collect through ZixOne.\nIn those cases, we will apply this Policy to the combined information, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data.</p>\n<p>To enhance user experience, some DeliverySlip Client Applications provide integration capabilities with Google G Suite\u2122 and Microsoft Office 365\u2122.\nIn such cases, Zix will have access to emails.\ncalendar data.\nfiles and folders data, such as those stored in Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive.\nand contact data.</p>\n<p>In addition, we supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, and to tailor our content to you.\nThese third party sources vary over time, but have included data brokers from which we purchase demographic data, third party partners and resellers, our customers, social media platforms, lead generation providers, content sponsors, and publicly-available sources such as open government databases or data in the public domain.\nWe combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Sites, Apps, and/or Services.\nIn those cases, we will apply this Policy to the combined information, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data.</p>\nHow We Use Information That We Collect\n<p>Zix uses information about you for our legitimate interests and business purposes, including as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide you with products, services and any renewals thereof, including but not limited to anti-spam, anti-virus, email archiving, email encryption, email hosting, and transmission services;</li>\n<li>To process your registration including verifying the information you provide is active and valid.\nIn our Zix Services, to facilitate secure messaging with third parties;</li>\n<li>To communicate with you including via email or push notification.\nTo monitor compliance with our Terms;</li>\n<li>To notify you when you receive a Zix service email message, when a Zix service email message has failed or expired, when an intended recipient has picked up an email message you sent (if you so request), when multiple attempts to enter your Zix service passwords have failed on our Site, and when there is any change in our Terms or in the availability of various products and services;</li>\n<li>To communicate with you concerning

person or property, or violation of our policies or our other rights or interests;</li>\n<li>To monitor traffic patterns and Site usage and where applicable report on traffic levels and/or statistics to certain enterprise customers, such as how many of their users are sending emails and from what departments;</li>\n<li>To test, analyze and improve our services and marketing.\nTo market existing and new Zix services;</li>\n<li>To resell, and sometimes provide support for, the offerings of third parties including Microsoft.\nTo inform you of any new or updated services or product offerings.\nand</li>\n<li>To provide tailored content and advertising.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use information about you with your consent, including as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To market existing and new Zix services to the friends or businesses you refer to Zix;</li>\n<li>To manage your participation in our surveys, contests, events, and other promotions.\nand</li>\n<li>To fulfill any other purpose disclosed to you and with your consent.</li>\n</ul>\nEmails and Attachments\n<p>Zix uses email message and attachment content in order to provide and improve our products and services.\nFor example, if you request that Zix host and operate a ZixGateway appliance on your behalf (the Zix\u2122 Hosted Services), we automatically scan outbound email and attachments to determine whether they should be encrypted in accordance with your policies, and to provide you with usage reports and to improve our email filters.\nand we collect and retain the content and attachments of outgoing email messages until they are delivered or the messages expire in accordance with your policies.\nLikewise, if you subscribe to our advanced threat protection service, we automatically and manually (with your consent) scan inbound email and attachments to protect you against advanced threats and to provide you with usage reports and to improve our email filters.\nand we collect and retain the content and attachments of inbound email messages until they are delivered or the messages expire in accordance with your settings.</p>\n<p>We primarily use the information we collect when you use the ZixOne App to provide you with access to your Exchange account and in connection with your relationship or your company\u2019s relationship with Zix.\nTo provide and enhance App performance, the back-end servers that support ZixOne (which may be hosted by Zix, your company, or their respective service providers) use and retain temporarily (which should usually not exceed a few days) emails, attachments, contacts, calendar items and other Exchange content (collectively \u201cExchange content\u201d) that you access and view.\nThe Exchange content is temporarily cached on your mobile device until you exit the App.\nFor example, the App accesses and downloads some of your contacts from your Exchange account when you use the App, such as to send an email.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that the App, like all other apps, runs in the background on your mobile device until you take steps to exit the App.\nPlease follow the directions from your mobile device manufacturer in order to exit the App.\nThe back-end servers sometimes retain Exchange content even after you exit the App.</p> Employment Applications\n<p>If you use the Site to apply to work with us (for example via www.zixc.com/company/careers) we will use the information you supply to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics.\nWe retain statistical information about applicants to help inform our recruitment activities.\nZix is headquartered in the United States and employee and recruitment data is held there and in other Zix locations worldwide.\nOnce a person has taken up employment with us, we will compile a file relating to their employment.\nAt that stage we will give the employee more details about how we hold employee data.</p>\nInformation Sharing and Disclosure\n<p>Subject to recent changes in the law, which may include a different definition of \u201csell\u201d from those previously used in this policy (further discussed below), Zix generally does not sell or rent your information, except in the event that Zix (or some or all of its assets) is merged with, sold to, or otherwise transferred to, one or more third parties.\nIn such an event, customer information might be included among the transferred assets and Zix reserves the right to disclose information it has about you for our business purposes including those described above in the Section entitled \u201cHow We Use Information That We Collect.\u201d Notwithstanding any such transfer, your information will remain subject to this Policy.\nOur customer database could be sold separately from the rest of the business, in whole or in a number of parts.\nIt could be that the purchaser\u2019s business is different from ours too.\nIf we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you have regarding your information.</p>\n<p>In addition, depending on the Zix Company Service(s) you use, Zix shares or discloses your information, and the information of your friends, family, or of others to whom you refer Zix, for business purposes as described below.\nThe information so shared or disclosed includes the categories of information described above in the Section entitled \u201cInformation That We Collect\u201d.\npublic encryption codes for your email address.\nand information about your account usage (including the number of email messages and attachments, if any, that you sent.\nthe list of recipients.\nand the subject and size of the combined text body of those email messages and attachments).<br>\nWe share:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>with persons or companies we retain to carry out or provide support to Zix (\u201cService Providers\u201d) and our legitimate interests and business purposes described in the Section entitled \u201cHow We Use Information That We Collect\u201d.\nWe contractually require that those Service Providers use information they obtain from Zix solely for the purpose of providing these services, although we permit them to use aggregate information that does not identify you for other purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Following is additional information about the vendors with whom we work across all our various product offerings.&nbsp;Zix and its affiliates may also provide these types of services in providing the Services to you.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Internet Infrastructure</em>\n<br>\nWe may use Cloud hosting and back-up, ISP, Local Loop, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and other Internet infrastructure vendors to connect our network to the Internet and co-location managers to provide data center infrastructure and physical security.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Service-Management Operations </em>\n<br>\nWe may use various vendors for administrative and solution-management purposes, such as billing, analysis, alerting, customer management, and marketing communications.&nbsp.\nFurthermore, we may use vendors for support services and the delivery of maintenance upgrades or other development of the Services (to include platform development tools).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>with your employer and/or compliance review committees for billing and auditing purposes.\nYour employer and/or the compliance review committee may be based in a different country from where you are based.\nThis could mean that we would disclose your data to them anywhere in the world.\nBy using our service you consent to that disclosure.\nPlease note with regard to ZixOne, that your company or employer also has the right or ability to access information stored, sent, received, or accessed on or through your Exchange account, independent of your use of the App.\nDepending on your company's arrangement with Zix, your company or its service providers - rather than Zix - may host the back-end servers that enable the App to function.\nYour company or employer has its own privacy and other policies that also apply to your use of the App and Exchange.\nZix is not responsible for the privacy practices of your company or other third parties.</li>\n<li>with our customers in connection with us processing your information on their behalf, including to respond to your questions, fulfill your requests, and otherwise comply with applicable law.</li>\n<li>to the extent that we determine it is reasonably necessary or legally required in order for us to respond to lawful requests by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), subpoenas, court orders, warrants, or other legal process.</li>\n<li>when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>\n<li>to enable a third party partner or independent reseller to contact you to facilitate the renewal, support or purchase of Zix products and services.</li>\n<li>with credit card authorization processors, third-party financial institutions and related organizations for billing and payment purposes so that they can verify the credit card numbers, process the credit card payment transaction, and prevent fraud or misuse of credit card facilities.</li>\n<li>with your consent or where disclosure is necessary in order to complete a transaction to which you have consented.</li>\n<li>as otherwise described in this Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Zix does not generally disclose personal information about you to any third parties for commercial purposes and does not sell personal information as the term \u201csell\u201d is traditionally understood.\nHowever, to the extent the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those disclosed below in the Section entitled \u201cAnalytics and Advertising\u201d as a \u201csale,\u201d Zix will comply with applicable law as to such activity.\nFor more information about how to opt-out of sale of personal information, see the Section below entitled \u201cCalifornia Resident Rights.\u201d</p>\n<p>We use testimonials from our customers, with their express consent, in order to show our customers and potential customers how Zix services have benefited others.\nTo request removal of your information from the testimonials on our Site, contact us at privacy@zixcorp.com.\nIn some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>\n<p>Without limiting the foregoing, Zix shares with certain business partners, advertisers, and other third parties certain aggregated or de-identified data that does not identify you, and email metadata (such as domains of senders and recipients), for various purposes, including marketing, except as prohibited by applicable law.</p>\nAnalytics and Advertising\n<p>To analyze traffic to our Sites (excluding zixmessagecenter.com and zixmessagecentre.com), Zix uses various web analytics services, which independently set and access their own tracking technologies (including cookies, web beacons, and embedded scripts) and collect or have access to information about you.</p>\n<p>In addition, Zix works with network advertisers and ad agencies to serve our advertisements on other web sites, within third party applications, and across the Internet, and to provide us with information regarding the effectiveness of our advertisements.\nFor example, if you clicked on a Zix advertisement that led you to one of our corporate sites, our service provider(s) and we can often determine which Zix advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement.\nHowever, Zix\u2019s advertising providers do not receive information regarding your use of the ZixMessage Center or your Greenview Data or Erado accounts, such as any URL you access within the message center or email message content you view.</p>\n<p>We also target advertisements based on your IP address and your web browsing activity on non-Zix websites.\nZix\u2019s advertising providers also store cookies and other tracking technologies on your device.\nYou can visit www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d) members, including the opt-out procedures of NAI members.\nIf you are visiting this site from the European Union, you can opt-out of certain interest-based ads by visiting www.youronlinechoices.eu.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served ads.\nYou will continue to receive generic ads.\nZix does not control the information collection, use, or sharing practices of third party analytics providers or advertisers.\nSome of these parties collect your information when you visit the Sites, Apps, Services, or other online websites and services.\nWe are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties\u2019 opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</p>\n<p>The Zix Companies have always considered our advertising technology partners to be Service Providers.\nHowever, regulators may interpret newer data protection laws such as the CCPA as characterizing certain kinds of digital advertising activities as \u201csales.\u201d In such an event, Zix will comply with applicable laws in connection with its use of such advertising technology services on its Sites, Apps, or Services.</p>\nSocial Features\n<p>Some of our Sites offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums.\nYou should be aware that any information you provide in these areas can be read, collected, and used by others who access them.\nTo request removal of

sections entitled \u201cEuropean Privacy Rights\u201d and \u201cCalifornia Privacy Rights\u201d, respectively, below.</p>\nSecurity\n<p>Zix takes reasonable precautions, including the maintenance of reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards, to help protect your information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized or illegal access, disclosure, alteration, modification, use or destruction.\nZix has implemented reasonable security measures to help protect your email address and the Zix service passwords associated with your email address from unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, unlawful destruction or accidental loss.\nWhen appropriate, Zix uses industry-standard encryption to protect certain data (e.g., credit card numbers) during transmission.\nThe servers on which we store your information are kept in an environment that is controlled and monitored 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\nAlthough Zix uses reasonable efforts to help protect your information, transmission via the Internet, Wi-Fi or mobile network is not completely secure and Zix cannot guarantee the security of your information.\nIn particular, it remains your responsibility:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To protect against unauthorized access to your use of the Sites and Services.</li>\n<li>To ensure no one else uses the Sites or Services while your machine is logged on to the Sites or Services (including by logging on to your machine through a mobile, Wi-Fi or shared access connection you are using).</li>\n<li>To log off or exit from the Sites and Services when not using them.</li>\n<li>To keep your password or other access information secret and all of your account details secure.\nYour Zix Company Service passwords and log in details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access, for example, over a network.</li>\n<li>To maintain good Internet security.\nFor example if your email account is compromised, this could allow access to your account with us.\nIf your email account is compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your account with us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think that any of your accounts has been compromised you should change your account credentials with us, and in particular make sure any compromised account (even one from another service) does not allow access to your account with us.\nNever use the same passwords for different accounts (among the Zix Company Services or with respect to other unrelated services).\nYou should also tell us as soon as you can so that we can try to help you keep your account secure and if necessary warn anyone else who could be affected.</p> Data Storage\n<p>Most account information (including email addresses, public keys, names, and mailing addresses, but excluding credit card information used for payment to Zix) is stored on multiple disk storage systems at our data centers in the United States or the United Kingdom or on servers in Canada, Singapore, and Amsterdam.\nThis means that we redundantly store data on more than one server in one of those locations.\nWe also store email messages on servers outside the United States and the United Kingdom including on servers in Canada, Singapore, and Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>Zix stores only the salted hash of a Zix service password.\nThis means that we don\u2019t hold your Zix service password itself but rather a unique encrypted version of it.\nZixMessage Center email messages that you send or receive via Zix services will ordinarily expire from our disk storage systems based on the expiration time set by the sender at the time the email was sent (1 to 365 days from the day the email message was sent).\nIf you request deletion of your Zix service account, that account will be deactivated and your email address and information will be removed from our user registration database associated with that Zix service within 30 days, subject to any need we have to hold onto the data for longer to meet any legal, auditing or regulatory requirements and subject to any commitments we have given to third parties \u2013 for example your employer if your employer paid for your Zix Company Service account.\nYou can also request deletion of all your Zix Company Service accounts.\nIf we do delete any of your accounts, those accounts will be reinitiated if another email is sent to you using a Zix Company Service.\nEmail header information maintained for purposes of transaction logging, and user account information maintained for disaster recovery purposes, will be held longer than the content of email messages, as described above, in order to provide Zix Company Services, and support, including technical support and business continuity, to our customers.</p>\n<p>If you use advanced threat protection services, including ZixProtect and SpamStopsHere, there will be particular points in time when the content of email messages and attachments (including non-spam messages) will not be encrypted, including but not limited to during spooling for delivery and on the way to quarantine.\nFurther, if you choose to use the manual review option, the content of those emails and attachments will be stored in unencrypted form for purposes of manual review.</p> Guidelines Regarding Children\n<p>Zix\u2019s Site, and Zix Company products and Services, are not designed for or directed to children under the age of 16, and Zix does not knowingly collect personal information as defined by the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) or personal information as defined under the CCPA from anyone under the age of 16.\nIf you are under the age of 16, please do not provide personal information of any kind whatsoever and please do not use Zix products and services or participate in Zix\u2019s surveys, contests, events, and other promotions.&lt;</p> Your California Privacy Rights Shine the Light Customer Rights\n<p>When California customers provide personal information as defined by California\u2019s \u201cShine the Light\u201d to a business, they have the right to request certain disclosures if that business shares the personal information (as narrowly defined under the Shine the Light law) with third parties or affiliates for the third parties\u2019 or affiliates\u2019 direct marketing purposes.\nOnce per calendar year the customer has the right to request that the business provide a list of companies with which it shares the personal information for the third parties\u2019 or affiliates\u2019 direct marketing purposes, and a list of the categories of personal information that the business shares.\nAs stated in this Policy, we do not share personal information as defined under the Shine the Light law with third parties or affiliates for those third parties\u2019 or affiliates\u2019 direct marketing purposes.\nCalifornia customers can request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing privacy@zixcorp.com or contacting us by mail at 2711 N.\nHaskell Avenue, Suite 2200, LB 36, Dallas, Texas 75204-2960, USA.\nPlease note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</p>\nCalifornia Consumer Rights Under the CCPA\n<p>If you are a California resident and a consumer customer of Zix, which in most cases means you are a customer of Total Defense, you have the right effective January 1, 2020, to request access to personal information we have collected about you, and to request other disclosures regarding the categories of personal information we have disclosed about you for business purposes or commercial purposes and regarding the categories of personal information we have sold about you, over the last 12 months.\nYou will also have the right effective January 1, 2020, to request that we delete personal information we hold about you if we collected the information directly from you.\nThe Zix Companies, including Zix and AppRiver, generally provide services to business customers, not individual consumers.\n&nbsp;If you represent a business, you do not have rights to request access to our deletion of your information pursuant to the CCPA.</p>\n<p>To exercise your access or deletion rights as a California resident consumer customer email us at privacy@totaldefense.com, call us at (855) 221-9691 or contact us through our online privacy request form.</p>\n<p>Effective January 1, 2020, to the extent Zix sells your personal information as the term \u201csell\u201d is defined under CCPA, you have the right to opt-out of sales of your personal information to third parties at any time.&nbsp;Zix does not sell personal information as the term \u201csell\u201d is traditionally understood.\nHowever, to the extent the CCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those disclosed in the \u201cAnalytics and Advertising\u201d section of our policy as a \u201csale,\u201d Zix will comply with applicable law as to such activity.\nPlease click the button below&nbsp;if you wish to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.</p>\n<p>Do Not Sell My Information</p>\n<p>As of the posting of this updated privacy policy, certain provisions of the CCPA are still in flux and may change.\nZix reserves the right to revise the sections of this policy that are impacted by those changes until such time as the regulations are finalized.\nGiven the potential changes in the law, the rights available to California residents may change at any time.</p>\nEuropean Privacy Rights\n<p>If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you.\nYou also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you.\nIn addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.\nYou have the right to withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.</p>\n<p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us as set forth in the section entitled \u201cPrivacy Policy Questions, Suggestions and Complaints\u201d below and specify which right you intend to exercise.\nWe will respond to your request within 30 days.\nWe sometimes require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity.\nPlease note that we store information as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, and continue to retain and use the information even after a data subject request for purposes of our legitimate interests, including as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.</p>\n<p>If your information has been processed by us on behalf of one of our customers and you wish to exercise any rights you have with such information, please inquire with our customer directly.\nIf you wish to make your request directly to Zix, please provide the name of the Zix customer on whose behalf Zix processes your information.\nWe will refer your request to that customer, and will support them to the extent required by applicable law in responding to your request.</p>\n<p>If you have any issues with our compliance, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a European supervisory authority.</p>\nData Controller\n<p>EU data protection law makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as \u201ccontrollers\u201d) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as \u201cprocessors\u201d).\nIn limited circumstances, Zix (located at the address set forth in the section entitled \u201cPurpose of this Policy\u201d above) operates as a controller, such as in connection with data collected from non-subscribers who browse its Site and when Zix Company Services involves a direct to consumer relationship.\nHowever, Zix generally operates as a processor on behalf of its customers that use the Zix services.\nThe customers are the data controllers and determine the purposes for which and the manner in which personal data are to be processed by Zix.\nPlease visit the applicable customer\u2019s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices.\nAny questions that you have relating to such personal data and your rights under data protection law should therefore be directed to the customer as the controller, not to Zix.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Zix has partnerships with resellers who offer Zix Services directly to consumers.\nThe resellers are controllers of the personal data they collect while offering and selling Zix Services to consumers.\nPlease direct any questions you may have regarding personal data collected or processed by resellers of Zix Services to the reseller, not to Zix.</p>\nLawful Basis for Processing\n<p>Data protection laws in Europe require a \u201clawful basis\u201d for processing personal data.\nWhen we operate as a controller, our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes.\n(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you.\n(c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.\nor (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests.\nOur legitimate interests include direct marketing and fraud prevention, among other things.</p>\nPrivacy
