obscene, sexually explicit or pornographic.\nNote that mere nudity e.g.\nas a form of protest or for educational/medical reasons will not fall foul of this rule.</li>\n<li>Infringe any patent,

settle their differences through dialogue and debate.\nMycompassclassroom.com exists to promote the free flow of information online.\nIt is our view that the responsible exercise of one\u2019s free

intelligently.</li>\n</ul> Copyright Infringement <p>If you believe that any User Contributions violate your copyright, please see our Copyright Policy for instructions on sending us a notice of
