importance of privacy concerns especially in the digital environment.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we have adopted this Privacy Policy for our Platforms.\nOn our Platforms, we collect personal information in two forms.\nOne form is information that we expressly request you to provide in connection with certain activities.\nThe second form is anonymous information that we automatically collect from your computer, phone or other device.</p>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy is based on the following principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You are free to choose whether or not to engage in any activity on our Platforms that involves your submission of personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number or other information that can be used to identify or contact an individual, whether

permitted under COPPA.\nWe will explain how we will use the information and use it only for that purpose.\nHere are examples of personal information that we request on our Children\u2019s Platforms:</p>\n<p>\u2022 Share With a Friend.\nVisitors can provide their first name, a friend\u2019s first name and friend\u2019s email address to send a feature of a Children\u2019s Platform to the

cookies and you may delete any cookies that you have received.\nHowever, should you decide to disable any cookies we place on your device, you may not be able to use certain services or features on our Platforms.\nA \u201cweb beacon\u201d is a one-pixel image (which may be visible or transparent), which may be embedded on a web page or e-mail message, and which may also provide us with information about usage of that page or e-mail message.</p>\nSpecial Circumstances\n<p>Law Enforcement and Safety.\nWe may access, preserve and share your information when we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to: (i) respond to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) or otherwise to take action because we believe it is required or advisable under the law.\n(ii) detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity.\n(iii) respond to your requests for customer service.\nor (iv) limit our legal liability or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of ourselves, any user of our Platforms, a third party or the general public including as part of investigations.</p>\n<p>Business Transfer.\nIf we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole

other information collected through our Platforms may be among the items sold or transferred.\nThe buyer or transferee will be required to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Security Notice.\nIn the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.\nIf a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent you have given us your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.\nYou consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.</p>\nService Providers\n<p>We contract with third parties to provide certain services to facilitate the

of personal information.</p>\nWhere We Store our Information\n<p>Your information collected through a Platform may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which we or our service providers maintain facilities.\nWe or our service providers may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or

U.S.\nlaw, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.\nBy using a Platform you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S.\nor to any other country in which we or our service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\nSecurity of our information\n<p>We strive to maintain the security of information but cannot guarantee that information security measures are fail-safe or guarantee that information on a Platform may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.\nOur Platforms maintain technical and organizational steps to keep information collected secure, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers and use of electronic security systems and password protections to guard against unauthorized
