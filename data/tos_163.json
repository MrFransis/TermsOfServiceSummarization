purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>\n<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal

at dpo@softnews.ro for more information or to exercise any of these rights:</p>\n<p>1.\nRequest access to your personal data (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\").\nThis enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>\n<p>2.\nRequest correction of the personal data that we hold about you.\nThis enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>\n<p>3.\nRequest erasure of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.\nNote, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>\n<p>4.\nObject to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.\nYou also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.\nIn some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>\n<p>5.\nRequest restriction of processing of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy.\n(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.\n(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need

the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.\nWe will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nNote that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>\n<b>Exercising these rights</b>\n<br>\n<p>Use our DSR (data subject request) form or send an email to dpo@softnews.ro</p>\n<p>You also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the

please contact us in the first instance.</p>\n<b>No fee usually required</b>\n<br>\n<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).</p>\n<b>What we may need from you</b>\n<br>\n<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).\nThis is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>\n<b>Time limit to respond</b>\n<br>\n<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.\nOccasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p> Specific legal rights for users located in California, United States of America (CCPA) <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act, Cal.\nCiv.\nCode \u00a71798.100 et.\nseq.\n(\u201cCCPA\u201d), grants residents of California

\u201csale\u201d in quotation marks because the CCPA considers some transfers of Personal Information to third parties in exchange for value as \u201csales,\u201d even if no money changes hands, such as when online identifiers, Device IDs, and other information is shared with Third Party Businesses to further their own commercial purposes such as generating profiles about individuals.\n.\nIf we have actual knowledge that a California resident is younger than 16, we will request opt-in consent before selling their Personal Information.\nNote that we can still share Personal Information with third parties if those transfers aren\u2019t \u201csales,\u201d such as with our Service Providers.</p>\n<p>3.\nDepending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have disclosed the following categories of your Personal Information for a \u201cbusiness purpose\u201d (as defined in the CCPA) in the preceding twelve (12) months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiers</li>\n<li>Commercial information</li>\n<li>Geolocation data</li>\n<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li>\n<li>Professional information</li>\n<li>Education information</li>\n<li>Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4.\nDepending on the circumstances and which Service you use, we have \u201csold\u201d (as defined in the CCPA) the following categories of your Personal Information in the preceding twelve (12) months:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiers</li>\n<li>Commercial information</li>\n<li>Geolocation data</li>\n<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information</li>\n<li>Professional information</li>\n<li>Education information</li>\n<li>Inferences drawn from any of the above information categories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5.\nYou can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf.\nHowever, we will require written proof of the agent\u2019s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.</p>\n<p>6.\nYou have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of any of your rights.</p>\n<p>7.\nCalifornia's \"Shine the Light\" law permits customers who are California residents to request certain details about how a business shares their personal information as defined by \"Shine the Light\" with third parties (and in some cases affiliates) for those third parties' or affiliates' own direct marketing purposes.\nCalifornia customers may request information about our compliance with this law by contacting us by e-mail at dpo@softnews.ro or by mail at the address set forth in Section 11 above.\nAny such mail inquiry must include \"California Privacy Rights Request\" in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code.\nPlease note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email or mail address.</p>

on the usage of \u201ccookies\u201d by SoftNews Net SRL in regard to this \u201cWebsite\u201d and the services offered within.</p> Definition\n<p>\u201cCookie\u201d is a term used to refer to cookie modules and similar technologies through which information can be collected and stored.</p>\n<p>An \u201cInternet Cookie\u201d (also known as \u201cbrowser cookie\u201d or simply \u201ccookie\u201d) is a small text file that contains alphanumerical data and is stored in the memory of computers, smartphones and other Internet-enabled devices.\nA cookie has two components: the name and the content.\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are installed (set) through instructions sent by a web server to a web browser (the application used to access a web site, such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome) or by using a client-side scripting language (such as Javascript).\nCookies are \u201cpassive\u201d by nature, meaning they cannot contain software applications, cannot contain malware and cannot themselves access information from the device they are stored on.</p>\n<p>By design, cookies can only be accessed by the same web site that installed them, whenever the user returns to that web site.</p> Cookie usage purposes\n<p>Cookies are used to improve the user experience of the Website, adapt some features to the preferences of each user, and ensure a smooth operation of the Website services.\nSpecifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registering a user account</li>\n<li>Saving user preferences</li>\n<li>Anonymous web traffic statistics to the Website (this allows us to see how we are doing and which areas of the Website can be improved)</li>\n<li>Delivery of online advertisements (since all Website services are free, this is how we are able to stay in business)</li>\n</ul> Cookie lifetime\n<p>Cookie lifetime can vary depending on their purpose.\nBased on lifetime, cookies fall in one of two categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session cookies: stored temporary, deleted automatically when the web browser is closed</li>\n<li>Persistent cookies: stored on the user\u2019s device until a specific time (which can be minutes, days, or years in the future) or until deleted manually through web browser settings or specialized computer software</li>\n</ul> Third-party cookies\n<p>Some parts of the content shown on the Website can come from external sources, which can add their own cookies, called \u201cthird-party cookies\u201d.\nSpecifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>YouTube:</b> embedded videos (using <i>youtube-nocookie</i> for improved privacy) - privacy

Cookie management information\n<p>Disabling cookies makes the Website harder to use.\nSome features will be degraded while others will not work at all.\nFor example, it is impossible to register or log in without cookies.\nThis way, using the download basket or the watchlist features is no longer possible.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, users can configure their web browser to reject (or accept) cookies sent by specific sites.\nAll modern browsers offer this functionality, which can be accessed through the \u201coptions\u201d or \u201cpreferences\u201d menu.</p>\n<p>Disabling cookies will not stop advertisements from being show, but it might make them less relevant to users\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Here are a few useful links about managing cookies:</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Video about cookies
