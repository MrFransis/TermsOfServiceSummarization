permitted.\nNeither you nor MediaLab will commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding that would affect other users of the Services.\nThe arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>\n<p>Any arbitration under this provision shall be held in Los Angeles, California (or, alternatively, via telephone or video conference) before and in accordance with the applicable rules of JAMS, which are available on the JAMS website.\nYou either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.\nArbitrations shall be conducted in English.&nbsp.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as

Policy:</p>\n<p>o &nbsp.\nWith vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to help us provide, protect, or maintain the Services;</p>\n<p>o &nbsp.\nWith measurement services to measure and optimize the performance of our Services, and to deliver more relevant ads, including for advertisers and other third-party websites and apps;</p>\n<p>o &nbsp.\nWith third parties offering goods and services for sale in our Services, who can receive your public information and additional information you provide them, including the information required to complete your transaction such as payment, shipping, and contact information.</p>\n<p>o &nbsp.\nAggregated, non-personally identifiable, de-identified information (i.e.\ninformation about you and other users collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) may be shared with third parties that provide services to us or perform business purposes for us to optimize advertisers\u2019 and other third-parties\u2019 ability to reach their target audience and markets;</p>\n<p>o &nbsp.\nWith third party service providers helping us to enforce our policies if we suspect your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of MediaLab or others, including to investigate, remedy, or enforce our Terms of Service;</p>\n<p>o &nbsp.\nWith law enforcement, government agencies, or in response to legal requests if we have a good faith belief that disclosing the information is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request (e.g.\nsubpoenas, court orders, government audits, etc.).\nThis may include responding to requests from outside the US when we have a good faith belief a response is required and involves a user in that other jurisdiction;</p>\n<p>o &nbsp.\nTo help us detect or prevent fraud, which may include sharing device, usage, and other information we have about you;</p>\n<p>o &nbsp.\nIn connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company;</p>\n<p>o &nbsp.\nBetween and among MediaLab, and its current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership, as permitted by applicable law, we may share information about you among the various Services in order to provide you a more consistent and optimal experience and to enforce our policies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>o &nbsp.\nWith your consent or at your direction.</p>\n<p>THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, LINKS, AND INTEGRATIONS</p>\n<p>As noted above, our websites, webforms and mobile application will contain third-party content, links, and integrations.\nFor example, when you use our Services you may be presented with content and links to an advertiser's website to learn more about their products and services.\nThrough these integrations, you will be providing information to an advertiser, other third parties, as well as to us.\nWe are not responsible for how an advertiser and such other third parties collect or use your information.\nAs always, we encourage you to read the privacy policies of every advertiser and third-party service that you visit or use.</p>\n<p>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</p>\n<p>How long we keep your information depends on the type of information, the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and other similar factors.&nbsp.\nFor example, we keep your information:</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nThat you submit through our Services (like your name, phone number, address, email address, etc.) until you ask us to delete it.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nFor the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy (including for as long as need to provide you with our Services), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nFor as long as necessary to investigate and resolve disputes and/or enforce our rights and agreements, including if your account is disabled for violation of our policies.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nIndefinitely if it is aggregated, anonymized, and de-identified (i.e., not capable of identifying you).</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nIn our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of time or as required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>If you ever decide to stop using our Services, you can ask us to delete your information (see \u201cYOUR CHOICES\u201d to learn more).&nbsp.\nKeep in mind, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe.\nAlso, there may be legal requirements to keep and not delete your information when you make a deletion request to us.\nThis means we may suspend deletion of or not delete your information if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve your information, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your use of our Services or your information is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations.</p>\n<p>HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</p>\n<p>The security of your personal information is very important, and we take a number of steps to safeguard it.\nFor example, we have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification.\nWe also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to guard your information, and we anonymize or expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide Services to our users or substantiate records for an advertiser.\nFrom time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.</p>\n<p>Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect, impenetrable, or 100% secure.\nWe cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner.\nThese are the risks of being online and conducting business online.</p>\n<p>Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.\nWe may also post a notice on our Services if a security breach occurs.\nDepending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing.\nIf you have any questions about the security of your information, please contact us at: kikprivacy@medialab.la.</p>\n<p>YOUR CHOICES</p>\n<p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools to exercise control over the information we have about you.\nKeep in mind that each option is subject to applicable legal limitations.\nAdditionally, because your privacy is important to us, we will ask you to verify your identity/request or provide additional information before we let you exercise your choices over the information we have about you.\nWe may also reject your request for several reasons, including, by way of example only, if the request risks the privacy of other persons or is unlawful.</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp.\nAccess and Portability.\nYou can access and receive a copy of the

parties that maintain their own marketing lists may send communications that advertise our Services.\nYou must contact these parties directly in order to stop receiving their communications.</p>\n<p>\u00b7 &nbsp.\nCookies and other Tracking Technologies.\nTo learn more about your choices and how to exercise control over the information we collect from you automatically using cookies and other online tracking technologies, read Cookies and Other Technologies.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or need assistance email us at kikprivacy@medialab.la.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nDeleting Account Information.</p>\n<p>Your contents and posts remain public, if they were posted publicly, so long as you or we do not delete them from the Services.\nYou may choose to delete your individual posts or contents at any time and we will then remove them from the Services.\nHowever, it is important to note that your deleted posts or contents may remain in storage in our systems for a limited period of time for legal, business, safety, or system backup reasons, and they may remain accessible in cached and archived pages of the Services or elsewhere if others have chosen to copy or save them.\nSearch engines and other sites may also index and cache content on our Services.\nYou may have to contact these third-party sites or search engines directly to delete your cached information, subject to their policies and procedures.</p>\n<p>If you wish to delete your account, please contact us by using the \u201cEmail Support\u201d link in settings from inside the applicable Product, or by emailing us at:&nbsp.\nkiksupport@medialab.la.&nbsp.\nRemember that information that others have shared about you is not part of your account and will not be deleted.</p>\n<p>As explained above, even after a deletion request, we may retain certain information as required by law, for legitimate business purposes, or for the safety of MediaLab (including its users) and others.\nWe may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain limited period of time.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nDeleting Location Information.</p>\n<p>When you first download or open any of our mobile application Services or access certain features of the Services, you will be asked to consent to the collection of location information from your mobile device or platform.\nIf you consent to the collection of this information but later wish to withdraw your consent, you may do so at any time by either changing the settings on your mobile device or deleting our mobile application Services from your device.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nOpting Out Of Cookies And Other Technologies.</p>\n<p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default but also give you the option to manage and/or disable cookies and other online tracking technologies.\nTo opt-out of the use of these technologies, you can usually change your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies.\nKeep in mind that not all devices and browsers are the same so the methods for disabling cookies on one browser may not be the same for different browsers or devices and may change at any time.\nOpting out of cookies and other tracking technologies may not preclude advertising networks from which you have not opted out from displaying customized advertising.&nbsp.\nIn addition, opting out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you.&nbsp.\nYou will need to make these choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our Services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you elect to opt-out of cookies for a particular Service, an opt-out cookie is placed on your device.\nThen when you visit the same Service, the opt-out cookie tells the Service you opted out.\nThis means that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services, including preventing your consent choices from being stored.&nbsp.\nAs a result, we may not know about, or be able to honor, your election to opt-out.&nbsp.\nWe encourage you to refer to the relevant instructions for your particular device or browser to learn how to manage cookies and other tracking technologies.&nbsp.\nFor more information on how to disable cookies on the most common browsers, we\u2019ve assembled the following information for you below:</p>\n<p>Browser

price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</p>\n<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.\nAny CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information\u2019s value and contain written terms that describe

information based on our legitimate interests, we consider how we can accomplish what we need to in a way that is the least obtrusive on your privacy.\nFor example, it is in our interest to protect your safety and security in the Services, so we collect and use information that has been flagged by users or requested by law enforcement.\nto make sure you are satisfied with how the services work, troubleshoot technical problems or develop new features, we collect and use information about how you and others use the services and to respond to your service inquiries, we collect and use
