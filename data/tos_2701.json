don\u2019t collect, and how we collect, use, and store information.\n<strong>We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries.\nWe also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration</strong>.</p>\n<p>Our guiding principle toward data collection is to collect only the minimal data required to operate a world-class VPN service at scale.\nWe designed our systems to not have sensitive data about our customers.\neven when compelled, we cannot provide data that we do not possess.</p>\n<p>This privacy policy will help you understand how Express VPN International Ltd.\n(\u201c<strong>ExpressVPN</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>we</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>our</strong>,\u201d or \u201c<strong>us</strong>\u201d) collects, uses, and stores information.</p>\n<p>Learn more about the independent audit report of

information:</p>(i) Information related to your account (\u201cpersonal information\u201d)<p>This information is collected for the purpose of administering your ExpressVPN subscription and includes your name, email address, and payment information, which you submit on our order page when you subscribe for the Services.</p>(ii) Aggregate Apps and VPN connection summary statistics<p>ExpressVPN collects minimal information about usage in order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service.\nThe section below specifies in detail what information we collect.\nThese statistics never include anything about what the user did with the VPN: no data about the contents or destinations of VPN traffic, no DNS queries, and no IP addresses.</p>(iii) (User-controlled option): Anonymous app diagnostics, including crash reports<p>App diagnostic data, which include crash reports, usability diagnostics, and VPN connection diagnostics, are anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual ExpressVPN users.\nThis feature is similar to a \u201csend bug report\u201d option.\nUsers can specify in the settings menu of any ExpressVPN App whether to send these data to us.</p>(iv) Only for users who choose to use the MediaStreamer service: IP addresses authorized to use MediaStreamer<p>Separately from VPN services, we also provide our optional MediaStreamer service for devices such as Apple TV that do not support VPNs.\nUsers who opt in to using MediaStreamer can choose to register specific IP addresses that should be authorized to use the service.\nthese IP addresses are only used by ExpressVPN to provide the optional MediaStreamer service and not for any other purpose.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Personal Information<p>\n</p>\n<p>ExpressVPN collects personal information that you provide to us directly through the Site.\nWe require that you provide personal information, such as an email address and payment information, in order to establish an ExpressVPN account, and so that we can email you, collect payments from you, and respond to support queries that you initiate.\nThe specific information collected varies depending on the payment method you choose.\nTo minimize the amount of personal information you submit to us, we recommend that you use Bitcoin payments when subscribing to our Service.</p>\n<p>With some forms of payment, the Site may redirect you to the website of a third-party payment processor (namely PayPal, BitPay, or Paymentwall) to complete the transaction.\nTo understand what personal information these processors collect and store, please refer to the respective processor's terms and privacy policy.</p>\n<p>ExpressVPN uses your email address for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To send emails related to payment transactions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To provide links to our Site, including password reset emails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To send you updates and announcements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To communicate with you about your VPN services or respond to your communications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To send marketing information, such as ExpressVPN offers, surveys, invitations, and content about other matters in connection with ExpressVPN (\u201c<strong>Marketing emails</strong>\u201d).\nYou may choose to not receive Marketing emails by following the opt-out procedure described in these emails.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ExpressVPN uses your personal information only for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy, and <strong>we do not sell your personal information to third parties</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Aggregate Apps and VPN Connection Summary Statistics<p>\n</p>\n<p>We ensure that we never log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries.\nTherefore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We do not know which user was connected to the VPN at a specific time or which VPN server IP addresses they used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We do not know the set of original IP addresses of a user\u2019s computer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should anyone try to compel ExpressVPN to release user information based on any of the above, <strong>we cannot supply this information because the data don\u2019t exist</strong>.</p>\n<p>In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, ExpressVPN collects the following information related to your VPN usage:</p>Apps and Apps versions<p>We collect information related to which Apps and Apps version(s) you have activated.\nKnowing your current version of the Apps allows our Support Team to troubleshoot technical issues with you.</p>Successful connection<p>We collect information about whether you have successfully established a VPN connection on a particular day (but not a specific time of the day), to which VPN location (but not your assigned outgoing IP address), and from which country/ISP (but not your source IP address).\nThis minimal information assists us in providing technical support, such as identifying connection problems, providing country-specific advice about how to best use our Service, and to enable ExpressVPN engineers to identify and fix network issues.</p>Aggregate sum of data transferred (in MB)<p>We collect information regarding the total sum of data transferred by a given user.\nAlthough we provide unlimited data transfer, if we notice that a single user pushes more traffic than thousands of others combined, thereby affecting the quality of service for other ExpressVPN users, we may contact that user for an explanation.</p>Summary<p>We collect minimal usage statistics to maintain our quality of service.\nWe may know, for example, that our customer John had connected to our New York VPN location on Tuesday and had transferred an aggregate of 823 MB of data across a 24-hour period.\nJohn can\u2019t be uniquely identified as responsible for any specific behavior because his usage pattern overlaps with thousands of other ExpressVPN customers who also connected to the same location on the same day.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve engineered our systems to categorically eliminate storage of sensitive data.\n<strong>We may know THAT a customer has used ExpressVPN, but we never know HOW they have utilized our Service</strong>.\nWe stand by our firm commitment to our customers\u2019 privacy by not possessing any data related to a user\u2019s online activities.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Anonymous App Diagnostics, including Crash Reports (can be turned off by the user)<p>\n</p>\n<p>With your permission, we collect anonymized app diagnostic data, which include crash reports, usability diagnostics, and VPN connection diagnostics.\nWe use these data in our network operations tools to help optimize network speeds and to let us identify problems and areas for improvement related to specific apps, VPN servers, or ISPs.\nThe information we receive is <strong>fully anonymized and cannot be tied back to individual ExpressVPN users</strong> (i.e., we do not store which user sent which data, and we do not store user IP addresses).</p>\n<p>If you <strong>opt in</strong> to share this information with ExpressVPN, we will collect the following anonymized information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Diagnostic information about if and how a VPN connection attempt failed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Speed test data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>App diagnostics, including crash reports and usability diagnostics, also without any personally identifiable information.\nThese are handled in an anonymized form by these third parties, dependent on the platform you are using ExpressVPN on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Windows</strong>: Hockeyapp, owned by Microsoft, and Sentry, owned by Functional Software, Inc.\nSee Microsoft\u2019s Privacy Policy and Sentry\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Mac</strong>: Crashlytics, owned by Google, and Sentry, owned by Functional Software, Inc.\nSee Crashlytics\u2019s Privacy Policy and Sentry\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Linux</strong>: Sentry, owned by Functional Software, Inc.\nSee Sentry\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>iOS</strong>: Firebase Crashlytics, owned by Google, and Apple.\nSee Apple\u2019s Privacy Policy and Firebase\u2019s Privacy and Security documentation.\nYou can disable Apple\u2019s crash reporting in iOS settings as described here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Android</strong>: Firebase Crashlytics, owned by Google.\nSee Firebase\u2019s Privacy and Security documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Browser extensions</strong>: Google Analytics, owned by Google.\nSee Google\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upon activation of any ExpressVPN App, you will be asked if you would like to share these data.\nYou can start or stop sharing these diagnostic data at any time in the App\u2019s settings menu.\nOn iOS, Apple\u2019s crash reporting can be turned off in iOS settings.</p>\n<p>\n</p>MediaStreamer<p>\n</p>\n<p>MediaStreamer is our service for consoles like Apple TV and other devices that don\u2019t support running a VPN.\nBecause the service doesn\u2019t run on an app and doesn\u2019t have an option for username/password authorization, we rely on a system that authorizes specific IP addresses that you have chosen to register with us.\nYou can register IP addresses by logging in to our website and using the \u201cDNS Settings\u201d page.\nThose IP addresses are then stored in our system in order to identify authorized devices for MediaStreamer, and are not used for any other purpose.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to use this service but have devices like an Apple TV that cannot run a VPN, we suggest using the ExpressVPN App for routers.\nLike all of our Apps and VPN Service, the App for routers does not require IP address registration.\nPlease contact us, and we\u2019ll guide you through the steps.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Jurisdiction and Applicable Law<p>\n</p>\n<p>ExpressVPN\u2019s core mission is to keep your information private.\nIn service of this mission, ExpressVPN\u2019s headquarters and registered place of business is in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), which has stricter laws concerning information disclosure than most countries.</p>\n<p>The BVI has no data retention laws, and any legal order requiring a BVI company to disclose customer records must come from the BVI Supreme Court.\nUnder BVI law, information requests from foreign courts or law enforcement are subject to a \u201cdual criminality\u201d provision, meaning that the request is upheld by the BVI Supreme Court only if the same crime is punishable by at least a one-year prison sentence under BVI law, had it taken place in the BVI.\nShould we receive a valid legal order from the BVI Supreme Court, it is important to note that <strong>ExpressVPN does not collect any IP addresses, browsing history, traffic data, or DNS queries that could be used to identify any specific user</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Storing of Information Related to Email, Live Chat, and Feedback Forms<p>\n</p>\n<p>ExpressVPN keeps records of any correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit to us through our Site or Services, along with our response.\nDepending on how you contact ExpressVPN, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us.\nHaving full correspondence records enables our staff to provide the best possible customer support experience.</p>\n<p>We use two different third-party platforms for support correspondence: Zendesk for emails and support tickets, and SnapEngage for live chat.\nWhen you correspond with us using these platforms, they will store your correspondence records\u2014including your email address, as well as user and device attributes that help with troubleshooting, such as the country you are contacting us from and your device\u2019s operating system.\nBoth platforms utilize modern security practices and HTTPS encryption.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Security Measures to Protect Your Information<p>\n</p>\n<p>ExpressVPN uses best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of information.\nAccess to user information is restricted to staff who require such access to perform their job functions.</p>\n<p>While we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data security measures in the world can offer 100% protection.</p>\n<p>Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices.\nNone of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of VPN Services.\nIf any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative options.</p>\n<p>Even if a government were to physically seize one of our VPN servers and manage to break its disk encryption, there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular event, website, or behavior.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Cookies and Mobile Identifiers<p>\n</p>What is a cookie?<p>A cookie is a small text file used to store information about your visit to the Site.\nCookies let ExpressVPN optimize and improve the user experience of the

preference, attribute visitors to a marketing channel, and, once you log in, securely show you information that is specific to your account.\nThe cookies contain a user identifier, but no directly personally identifying information such as your name or email address, and do not track any activity outside of ExpressVPN\u2019s domains.</p>Third-party cookies<p>ExpressVPN uses third-party services such as Google Analytics and Adwords.\nCookies from such services are used to collect data for statistical reports.\nFor example, we may generate reports regarding the amount of time users spend on

visited our Site.\nWe may show such users advertisements on a Google search results page, or on a site in the Google Display Network.</p>\n<p>Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone\u2019s past visits to the Site.\nAny data collected will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Google\u2019s privacy policy.\nUsers may opt out of Google\u2019s use of cookies by visiting the Google Advertising Opt-out Page.\nUsers may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics Opt-out Page.\nUsers may opt out of third-party vendor use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt-out Page.</p>Mobile identifiers<p>A mobile identifier is an identifier provided by an Android or iOS device.\nIt does not contain your name or email address.\nExpressVPN uses mobile identifiers to generate statistics related to the marketing channels and advertising partners through which users learned about and signed up for ExpressVPN mobile apps.</p>Disabling or resetting mobile identifiers<p>Users may disable or reset the mobile identifiers associated with their devices at any time.\nFor instructions, see Apple\u2019s page on

\u201c<strong>Agreement</strong>\u201d) between you and ExpressVPN.\nIf you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you may not use our Services.</p>\n<p>By creating an account for using our Services, you represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age or that you are a valid legal entity, and that the registration information you have provided is accurate and complete.</p>2.\nModification<p>ExpressVPN may update the Terms from time to time without notice.\nIf you continue to use ExpressVPN\u2019s Services, Content, Site, Apps, or Software after these changes take effect, then you agree to the revised Terms.\nThe current version of the Terms is available on the Site.\nYou understand and agree that it is your obligation to review these Terms from time to time in order to stay informed on current rules and obligations.\nNotification on any core changes to the Terms will be provided to subscribers through an email message or update to the Site.\nYour use of the Content or Services following the changes to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changed Terms.</p>3.\nPrivacy Policy<p>ExpressVPN is committed to your privacy and does not collect or log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries from Subscribers connected to our VPN.\nDuring your registration, we may collect some sensitive personal information, such as your email address and payment information.\nWe only collect information that are necessary for the proper delivery of the Site and Services.</p>\n<p>For the sake of clarity and transparency, we have placed all information related to data collection in a separate document known as the Privacy Policy, which is available on the Site.\nPlease review the Privacy Policy in its entirety to get a clear understanding of how we handle your sensitive data.</p>4.\nSubscriptions<p>ExpressVPN Services are available to you upon registration on the Site.\nBy subscribing to the Services, you agree to become a subscriber (\u201c<strong>Subscriber</strong>\u201d) for the period you have elected.\nA full list of subscription plans and pricing is available on the Site.\nExpressVPN reserves the right to amend subscription fees or institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice posted on the Site or sent via email.\nAny changes to the pricing will not affect the Subscriber\u2019s current subscription period and will become effective upon subscription renewal.\nSubscription purchases and refunds are handled via multiple third-party payment companies.</p>\n<p>When supported by your payment method, plans renew automatically by default at the completion of the billing term.\nBy default, the renewal term is for the same duration as the billing term for the original subscription.\nThe subscription fee will be charged automatically to the payment method you last selected.\nIf you would like to discontinue automatic renewal, you may sign in to the Site and turn off auto-renewal.\nBy default, auto-renewal is turned on when you use a payment method that supports auto-renewal (such as a credit card or Paypal), and turned off when you use a payment method that does not support auto-renewal (such as Bitcoin).</p>\n<p>Each paid subscription grants you one (1) license to use on five (5) different devices at any given time.\nIf you want to use the Services on more than five devices at a time, then you can either (i) use ExpressVPN on your router, (ii) purchase additional subscription plans, or (iii) purchase additional licenses through the \u201cvolume licensing\u201d option.\nFor more information on \u201cvolume licensing\u201d program, please contact Support.</p>5.\nRefund Policy<p>You may cancel your account with a full refund within 30 days of your initial purchase (\u201c<strong>Money Back Guarantee</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>Refunds beyond the 30-day purchase window will be considered, at the sole discretion of ExpressVPN, if a Subscriber can demonstrate that the Service was not available or usable during the subscription period and that reasonable attempts were made to contact ExpressVPN to resolve the issue.\nIn this case, ExpressVPN may provide the Subscriber with a pro-rata refund of service fees paid during the period when the Service was not available or usable.</p>\n<p>Refunds are generally processed within seven (7) days, and are made to the original form of payment used for purchase.\nAll refunds are sent in USD and therefore the refund amount could differ from the amount originally paid in local currency or Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Any change to the original purchase, such as upgrading to an extended billing term or purchasing of additional licenses under the same account, shall constitute a waiver of the Money Back Guarantee option.\nTo request a refund under the Money Back Guarantee, send an email with your request to the following email address: <strong>support@expressvpn.com</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Users whose subscriptions are billed as an in-app purchase through the Apple App Store (iTunes) do not have access to the ExpressVPN 30-day money-back guarantee.\nInstead, users can request refunds through the App Store, which are issued solely at the discretion of Apple Support.</p>6.\nAcceptable Use Policy<p>ExpressVPN Services may be accessed
