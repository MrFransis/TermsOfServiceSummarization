(\u201cCOPPA\u201d) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under thirteen (13).\nWe collect limited personal information (e.g.\nfirst name and gender) about minors on the site, but only where you, the minor's parent or legal guardian, has provided that information to us during the registration process.\nSuch information is not shared with third parties and is only shared internally, as described in our Privacy Policy .\nA child's usage information, such as scores from games and assessments is only shared in an aggregated anonymous manner and never in a way that could personally identify the minor.\nFor example, you might know your child's math scores rank in the top 10% for children in that zip code, but we will never identify or compare a minor's score that personally identifies a minor.\nIn the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a minor without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.\nIf you believe that your child or a minor may have provided us personal information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Website, please contact us at compliance@splashmath.com.\nAfter you enroll your child into one of our tutoring programs (SplashLearn Courses) and provide us with your verifiable consent in a manner set forth in our Privacy Policy , children may then share their personal information with the tutor and other students in the class during live video sessions.\nRecordings of such live classes may be shared with the tutor as well as other students in the class and their parents.\nIf you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under thirteen (13) will be accessing the Services.\nYou are responsible for understanding how our Services may collect and use information of users of the Services, including children.\nWhen obtaining consent from parents or guardians, you must provide them with our Privacy Policy .\nYou must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them.\nIf you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school and/or district to use the Services as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district.\nIf you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a school or school district, you will only grant access codes to teachers and staff members who are current employees of your school or district.\nUpon termination of a teacher or other staff member's employment with you, you will require such individual to return and cease using all access codes he or she has in his or her possession.\nIf at any time you learn a user of the Services claims to be affiliated with your school or district who is not, in fact, affiliated with your school or district, you

appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.\nYou agree that SplashLearn shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.\nIf there is a dispute between participants on this site or Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that SplashLearn is under no obligation to become involved.\nIn the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release SplashLearn, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services.\nYou shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: \u201cA general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.\u201d Will SplashLearn ever change the Services?\nWe\u2019re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time.\nWe may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.\nWe will make reasonable efforts to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you.\nWe reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.\nDo the Services cost anything?\nThe Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the Services.\nIf you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.\nNote that if you elect to receive text messages through the Services, data and message rates may apply.\nAny and all such charges, fees or costs are your sole responsibility.\nYou should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees or costs may apply to your use of the Services.\n<ol>\n<li>\na) Paid Services.\nCertain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the \u201cPaid Services\u201d).\nPlease note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.\nFor example, some Paid Services will charge a fee for downloading or installing the Services through the App Store (as defined below) linked to your specific device.\nYou agree to comply with, and your license to use our mobile application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions.\nAny refunds relating to the applications or inquiries regarding refunds relating to the applications shall be handled solely by the applicable App Store in accordance with such App Store\u2019s terms and conditions.\n</li>\n<li>\nb) Billing.\nWe use a third-party payment processor (the \u201cPayment Processor\u201d) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your \u201cBilling Account\u201d) for use of the Paid Services.\nThe processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms.\nCurrently, we use Stripe, Inc.\nas our Payment Processor.\nYou can access Stripe\u2019s Terms of Service at https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal and their Privacy Policy at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.\nWe are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor.\nBy choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your \u201cPayment Method\u201d).\nYou agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.\nWe reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.\n</li>\n<li>\nc) Payment Method.\nThe terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.\nIf we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.\n</li>\n<li>\nd) Recurring Billing.\nAs agreed to by you, some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring periods, for each of which there is a one-time charge of the same amount as made during the initial period.\nBy choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.\nWE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.\nSUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT.\nTO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS.\n</li>\n<li>\ne) Current Information Required.\nYOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT.\nYOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD.\nCHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS.\nIF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.\n</li>\n<li>\nf) Change in Amount Authorized.\nIf the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction.\nAny agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.\nYou agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.\n</li>\n<li>\ng) Auto-Renewal for Paid Services.\nUnless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your account settings, any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate.\nTo change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to account settings or, for mobile applications, cancel your subscription in the subscription management section of the applicable App Store.\nIf you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.\nHowever, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING BASIS BASED ON YOUR SELECTED PLAN.\nYOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SERVICE THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT SETTINGS OR TERMINATE YOUR SPLASHLEARN ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING TERM.\nPAID SERVICES CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, SPLASHLEARN WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID.\n</li>\n<li>\nh) Reaffirmation of Authorization.\nYour non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service.\nWe may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.\nThis does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.\nYour charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.\n</li>\n<li>\ni) Free Trials and Other Promotions.\nAny trial that provides access to a Paid Service without charge must be used within the period specified for the trial.\nYou must stop using a Paid Service before the end of that trial period in order to avoid being charged for access to the Paid Service.\nIf you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and believe you have been inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at help@splashlearn.com.\n</li>\n</ol> What if I want to stop using the Services?\nYou\u2019re free to do that at any time by contacting us at help@splashlearn.com.\nplease refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.\nSplashLearn is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.\nSplashLearn has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.\nAccount termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.\nIf you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at help@splashlearn.com \u2013 we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can\u2019t promise that we can recover or restore anything.\nProvisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.\nBy way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.\nWhat about Mobile Applications and In-App Purchases?\nYou acknowledge and agree that the availability of our mobile application is dependent on the third party stores from which you download the application, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an \u201cApp Store\u201d).\nEach App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading mobile applications from such store, including the specific terms relating to Apple App Store set forth below.\nYou agree to comply with, and your license to use our application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions.\nTo the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms of Use apply.\nThrough our mobile applications, you may purchase (\u201cIn-App Purchase\u201d) certain goods or features designed to enhance the performance of the Services.\nWhen you make an In-App Purchase, you are doing so through either the Apple iTunes service or the Google Play service and you are agreeing to their respective Terms and Conditions, available at http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html and http://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html).\nSplashLearn is not a party to any In-App Purchase.\nI use the SplashLearn App available via the Apple App Store \u2013 should I know anything about that?\nThese Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including our iOS applications (the \u201cApplication\u201d) available via the Apple, Inc.\n(\u201cApple\u201d) App Store, but the following additional terms also apply to the Application: <ol>\n<li>\na) Both you and SplashLearn acknowledge that the Terms are concluded between you and SplashLearn only, and not with Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for the Application or the Content.\n</li>\n<li>\nb) The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to

You will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device that you own or control.\n</li>\n<li>\nd) You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application.\n</li>\n<li>\ne) In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure.\nupon notification, Apple\u2019s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application.\n</li>\n<li>\nf) You acknowledge and agree that SplashLearn, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application.\n</li>\n<li>\ng) You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, SplashLearn, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim.\n</li>\n<li>\nh) You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S.\nGovernment embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.\nGovernment as a \u201cterrorist supporting\u201d country, and that you are not listed on any U.S.\nGovernment list of prohibited or restricted parties.\n</li>\n<li>\ni) Both you and SplashLearn acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third-party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use.\nand\n</li>\n<li>\nj) Both you and SplashLearn acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple\u2019s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.\n</li>\n</ol> Can I refer other users?\nFrom time to time SplashLearn may offer rewards or incentives for referring others to the Services.\nThe details of such offers will be made available to you on our website.\nWhat else do I need to know?\nWarranty Disclaimer.\nSplashLearn and its licensors, suppliers, partners, parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and assigns (SplashLearn and all such parties together, the \u201cSplashLearn Parties\u201d) make no representations or warranties concerning the Services, including without limitation regarding any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and the SplashLearn Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services.\nThe SplashLearn Parties make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through or in connection with the Services.\nTHE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY SPLASHLEARN (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN \u201cAS-IS\u201d BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nLimitation of Liability.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE SPLASHLEARN PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) ONE-HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID AND/OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO SPLASHLEARN IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nIndemnity.\nTo the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold the SplashLearn Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.\nIn the event of such a claim, suit, or action (\u201cClaim\u201d), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).\nAssignment.\nYou may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without SplashLearn's prior written consent.\nWe may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.\nChoice of Law.\nThese Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.\nArbitration Agreement.\nPlease read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with SplashLearn and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from SplashLearn.\nBoth you and SplashLearn acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, SplashLearn's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.\n(a) Arbitration Rules.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement.\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.\nIf such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California.\nThe arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \u201cRules\u201d) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.\nThe arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n(b) Costs of Arbitration.\nThe Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nSplashLearn will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.\nSplashLearn will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.\n(c) Small Claims Court.\nInfringement.\nEither you or SplashLearn may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work.\nFurthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.\n(d) Waiver of Jury Trial.\nYOU AND SPLASHLEARN WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou and SplashLearn are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn any litigation between you and SplashLearn over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SPLASHLEARN WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor SplashLearn is entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.\n(f) Opt-out.\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 548 Market St #64304, San Francisco, CA 94104 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.\nYou must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.\n(g) Exclusive Venue.\nIf you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or SplashLearn to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and SplashLearn agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.\n(h) Severability.\nIf the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.\nThis arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with SplashLearn.\nMiscellaneous.\nYou will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the SplashLearn may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.\nThe failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nIf any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nYou and SplashLearn agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and SplashLearn, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of SplashLearn, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind SplashLearn in any respect whatsoever.\nExcept as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple Application and the arbitration agreement, you and SplashLearn agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Math Games for Kids</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Multiplication
