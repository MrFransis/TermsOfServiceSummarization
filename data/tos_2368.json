You.\nYou may choose to provide us with information, some of which may be personal data, when you interact with the Services in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send us an e-mail message or complete an inquiry form \u2014 for example, you might e-mail us with a question and we will use your e-mail address to respond;</li>\n<li>Submit a comment, leave feedback, or send us a photo or video \u2014 for example, you might submit a photo of a weather event that we may post on the Services so others can enjoy it.<br> Special Note about Content Submissions.\nThe Services may from time to time offer areas where you and other users can post or otherwise submit information, photos, videos, graphics, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, ratings or other materials on or to the Services (collectively, \"Submissions\").\nAny geolocation information, tags, or other metadata in Submissions may become publicly available.\nAny information, including personal data, in your Submissions can be read, collected, or used by others.\nWe cannot control and are not responsible for how others may use the information contained in your Submissions;</li>\n<li>Engage with interactive advertising \u2014 we may receive the information you provide when you submit oral or written questions or comments via the interactive ads that are placed on the Services or on third-party platforms.\nand we may share this information with our advertisers where required by applicable law.\nand</li>\n<li>Customize the Services \u2014 for example, you might set a \"home\" location so that every time you visit the Services, you are automatically displayed the weather for that home location.<br> &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automatic Collection.\nWe also collect certain information through automated means.<br> Some of the information we collect through automated means may, whether alone or combined with other data, be personal data.\nFor example, we automatically collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information about your device and device capabilities</li>\n<li>Information about your device operating system</li>\n<li>Information about your browser</li>\n<li>Information about how you use the Services</li>\n<li>Your activities on the Services</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>Advertising identifiers</li>\n<li>Mobile or Internet Carrier</li>\n<li>Browser type</li>\n<li>Browser identifier</li>\n<li>Referring URL<br> &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This information helps us to understand, analyze, and measure how users use the Services.\nmanage Services' operations.\ndeliver and measure the effectiveness of advertisements.\nhelp diagnose problems.\nrecognize repeat visitors.\nand facilitate your access to and use of the Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Location Information.\nWe, our service providers, and our Ad and Analytics Vendors (see Section 2 for more information) may collect location information through the Services.\nWe may share the location information we collect with third parties as addressed in Section 3.</p>\n<p>We collect location information to provide you with location-based services (such as severe weather alerts, air quality, and other weather information through our mobile applications), provide advertisements that are relevant to your geographic location, and conduct analytics to improve the Services.\nThe type of location information we collect depends on your settings in the device you use to access the Services.</p>\n<p>If you are accessing the Services through the Site, we may detect your general location so that we can automatically show you the weather for your general area.\nDepending on browser type and configuration, your browser may inform you that the Site would like to collect your specific location and request your permission to do so.\nIf you do not allow it, or your browser does not permit it, only your general location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device.\nYou may always manually enter a location (such as city, postal code, and country).\nOn mobile web, if you opt out of sharing your current location, you may continue to receive content that is relevant for the city you have entered in the search bar (i.e., contextual city name).</p>\n<p>If you access the Services on your mobile device, we may directly collect precise geographic location information and sensor data via Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular network information, and other location-based features.\nWe typically receive the latitude and longitude of your mobile device, as well as date and time and sensor data such as altimeter.\nFactors such as device and operating system determine the accuracy of this latitude and longitude and how closely it corresponds with your device\u2019s location.</p>\n<p>If you allow any of The Weather Channel mobile applications to directly collect location information while the mobile applications are running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection.\nThis may allow us to send you severe weather alerts for the area in which you might be travelling.\nWe also use this location information to conduct analytics, provide relevant advertisements, and improve the Services.</p>\n<p>You can turn off direct location collection (or, on some operating systems, continuous direct location collection) through your device settings or by deleting the mobile application from your device.\nIf you turn off location-based services, you may continue to receive alerts for locations that you have selected within the Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<i>Alerts and Notifications.</i> Certain Services offer you the ability to receive push notifications for weather-related updates.\nTo provide these Services, we may need to collect your device information and/or mobile carrier information, in addition to the postcode or geographic area to which the alert, update, or notification pertains.\nWhere available with our Services, Hands-Free Audio Alerts allow you to receive voice alerts for weather-related updates while you likely are driving.\nIn order to provide you with hands-free alerts, we will need to collect your device's motion data solely to detect when you likely are in a moving vehicle.\nYou can choose to stop sharing your device's motion data at any time, but hands-free alerts are only available when your device's motion data is being shared.<br>\n<br> If you no longer wish to receive these types of notifications, you may opt out by turning them off within the settings of your mobile device or the particular Service for which you registered, or by deleting the application.<br> &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Information from Analytics and Advertising Vendors.\nWhere legally permissible, we may obtain information about you or your use of the Services from our vendors and advertisers.\nWe may combine the information you provide us and information we automatically collect with information from public or third-party sources.\nIf we combine or associate information from other sources with personal data that we collect through the Services, we will treat the combined information as personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br> &nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Data Collection Technologies and Consumer Choice <p>We and third parties acting on our behalf or on behalf of our vendors use various technologies that help us to manage the operations of our Services and track usage behavior.\nThese technologies enable us to tailor information and advertisements to make your visits more meaningful and to offer accurate forecast data to everyone, everywhere, free of charge.\nWe follow the self-regulatory principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance (\"DAA\"), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (\"DAAC\"), and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (\"EDAA\").</p>\n<p>We work with a variety of advertising services (\"Ad Vendors\"), and advertisers that use various technologies to collect data about your use of the Services (such as content viewed or ads clicked on) in order to serve relevant ads.\nAd Vendors use various technologies on the Services on our Site and within our mobile applications to (among other purposes): track how the Services are used, what pages or content users interact with, and what sites or mobile applications users interact with after they leave the Services.\nlink users' devices.\nand serve more relevant ads on and within the Services or other websites or mobile applications that you visit.\nAd Vendors and advertisers may combine this data with other information they may have obtained from you or from other sources that is unrelated to your use of the Services in order to target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements.\nMore information about this type of advertising that is tailored to your likely interests based on your activities across other apps or websites (\u201cpersonalized advertising\u201d) is available from the Network Advertising Initiative's website.</p>\n<p>We also contract with certain entities that use data collection technologies to track, analyze, and report data about the use of the Services and to analyze and optimize the performance of the Services (\"Analytics Vendors\").</p>\n<p>Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data.\nWe and our vendors may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the Services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Information Saved by Other Technologies</p>\n<p>Third parties may use cookies and other technologies through use of our Services to support or deliver personalized advertising on third-party websites and online services.\nThe data collection technologies we and third parties use on web include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website and stored within your browser.\nCookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit to that website or to another website that recognizes those cookies.\nSome cookies on our Services collect IP and MAC addresses, which may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions.\nCookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's device.\nFor more information, please visit this \u201cAll About Cookies\u201d guide.\nThe cookies used on this website can be categorized in the following ways:</p>\n<p>Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies<br>\n<br> These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the Services and its features.</p>\n<p>Category 2: Performance Cookies<br>\n<br> These cookies collect information about how you use the Services (such as which pages you go to most often and if you receive error messages).\nIn general, these cookies do not collect information that directly identifies you.\nHowever, some such cookies may collect GeoIP or other identifiers that may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>Category 3: Functionality Cookies<br>\n<br> These cookies allow Services to remember choices you make (such as language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features (such as local weather reports or traffic news).\nThese cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to customize the Services.</p>\n<p>Category 4: Targeting Cookies<br>\n<br> These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits.\nThey are often placed by advertising networks rather than website operators.\nThey collect information about your interactions over time with the Services as well as with third-party websites and online services.\nThis information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers in order to provide you with advertisements that may be more relevant to you based on your inferred interests.</p>\n<p>Category 5: Social Network Cookies<br>\n<br> These cookies are generally generated by content embeds.\nThey allow social network users to share content and use other features such as publishing comments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Web beacons:</strong> Certain pages on the Services contain web beacons.\nWeb beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that accessed the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.<br> &nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Web Storage:</strong> We use local storage, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e.g., volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the Services.\nLocal storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text.\nBy itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device.<br> &nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use of Advertising Identifiers</p>\n<p>We and our Ad Vendors may collect information about usage of mobile applications via advertising identifiers to support or deliver personalized advertising.\nAn advertising identifier is a randomly-generated alphanumeric code associated with a user's device to help advertising services.\nAdvertising identifiers provide advertisers a way to identify a user's device without using a permanent device identifier, such as serial number.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>Your Choices Around Cookies, Advertising Identifiers, and Other Technologies Used by Advertisers and Vendors</i>\n</p>\n<p>You have the ability to control how your data is used, including for personalized advertising, in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vendors: This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of our vendors outside of our Services and we do not control our vendors\u2019 technologies.\nWe provide links to more information about our vendors\u2019 privacy practices and any available opt outs here.</li>\n<li>Browser settings: Your web browser may allow you to manage your cookies and local storage to control access to data about your online activity.\nWe encourage you to check your browser\u2019s \u201cHelp\u201d feature to learn how to block, disable, and delete cookies.\nPlease note that for technical reasons, if you delete or block certain cookies, some features of the site may be unavailable or may not function as intended.\nFor more information, please visit this \u201cAll About Cookies\u201d guide&nbsp;on managing cookies.</li>\n<li>Device settings: The Android and iOS mobile device operating systems allow you to control how your device\u2019s advertising identifier is used to support or deliver personalized advertising.\nAndroid device settings (version 2.3 and above): \u201cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u201d by following the instructions provided by Google here&nbsp;iOS device settings (version 6 and above): \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d by following the instructions provided by Apple here.<br> &nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The opt outs described above are device- or browser-specific and may not be available for all devices.\nSo, if you opt out on your mobile device, you may continue to receive personalized advertising on your desktop computer or other devices.\nIf you choose to opt out, you will still see ads, but the ads will not be based on your activities across other apps and websites you use.</p>\n<p>You can also opt out of future information collection from the Services by adjusting the settings on your device, ceasing use of the Service on web, or un-installing the relevant mobile application.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> How We Share or Disclose Your Information with Vendors <p>We may also share any information collected from the Services including aggregated or statistical data that we may generate from such information in the following ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Service Providers.\nWhen your data is collected on the Services, it may be shared with select Analytics Vendors and Ad Vendors that assist us with marketing or advertising campaigns for our brands, and providers of services that assist us with our business operations, with the provision of the Services, or in delivering you the features and functionality that you have requested (\"Technical Vendors\").\nThese service providers include companies that support our advertising programs for our brands, provide data storage, support customer service, assist with audience research and product development, facilitate or deliver materials to you, and provide map content for the Services.\nOur service providers are authorized to use the data that we provide to them only to carry out the service they are providing for us.\nAll such service providers are contractually bound by us to keep the data confidential.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<p>Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services.\nWe may share location data, advertising identifiers, IP address, and aggregate usage statistics for the Services with advertisers.</p>\n<p>At times, we will provide you with the opportunity to choose to receive promotions, products, or services from third-party sponsors.\nWe also may provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from specifically-identified third parties through the Services.\nIn these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer.\nWhen you choose to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with them to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested.\nWe are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by their privacy policies.\nYou should review the privacy policies of these third parties before supplying personal data to them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other Websites, Other Services, Plug-Ins and Links.\nLike many websites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, the Services may link to webpages located on websites or services maintained by various other entities.\nIn some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of the Services such as in the header or footer or an interactive ad.\nIn that case, the URL or prominent text on the other website will identify the site you are visiting.\nIn other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-e-mail opportunities.\nThese other sites and services are not bound by our Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices.\nThe privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personal data.</p>\n<p>Some of the Services allow users to interact with other websites or services.\nYou may remain logged into those other sites and services until you log off.\nYour use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Some of the Services use third-party operating systems, platforms, communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone, and tablet devices), and some of the Services are provided by third-party distributors, device makers, device operators, platform operators, and communication services.\nWe do not control these third-party entities, products, and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit, and disclose your information.\nAs we do not control these third-parties' data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy policies, terms of use, and license agreements (if any).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ad <i>Vendors and advertisers</i>.\nWe may share information we collect with Ad Vendors and advertisers so that they can: (i) deliver and/or support the delivery of relevant content or ads on our websites or apps, their own websites or apps, or other third-party websites or apps, and.\n(ii) analyze and report on content or ads users see or interact with.\nAd Vendors and advertisers may also collect information via the technologies discussed in section 2 above or via interactive ads.\nThe information may include data about how users interact with the Services, information users provide via interactive ads, the content and ads users have viewed, users' activities on other websites and online services, and physical places users have visited.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Purchase or Sale of Businesses.\nWe continually look for ways to improve our business, including purchasing a business or selling all or part of our business.\nIf we buy, merge, reorganize or sell any business or assets, personal data and non-personal information will likely be disclosed or transferred as part of the transaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aggregated Information.\nAs part of the Services, we may aggregate or otherwise alter information (including location information) that is collected from the Services so that it does not identify your device and cannot reasonably be linked to your device.\nWe may use or share such information with third parties for research or commercial purposes (e.g., analyzing trends based on foot traffic).\nAs explained in section 1.C.&nbsp;above, you can turn off the collection of location data through your device settings.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Other Limitations on Privacy <p>We, our affiliates, or our service providers may disclose your data without your permission (i) pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders or otherwise to comply with law.\n(ii) where we believe an individual's rights, property, or safety or security is at risk.\n(iii) if we find that your actions violate our Terms of Use or any of our other legal rights.\nor (iv) where otherwise required or permitted by applicable law (which may include a lawful access request by U.S.\nor foreign courts, governments, or law enforcement agencies).</p>\n</li>\n<li> Retention Period <p>We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide and develop the Services.\nWe will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\nWe may retain information that no longer identifies you indefinitely.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Data Rights <p>You can request to access, obtain a portable copy of, correct, or delete data related to your stored preferences and your use of the Services.\nBecause we do not require users to register in order to use our Services, if you use more than one of our Services, or if you use our Services on more than one device or web browser, you will need to manage your data for each of the Services separately.\nTo manage your Data Rights on weather.com, click here.\nTo manage your Data Rights on the iOS or Android app, navigate to Data Rights in the app

States, information that we collect (including through cookies) will be processed and stored in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the data protection and privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen.\nSubject to applicable law, by using our Services and providing information to use, you consent to the transfer to and processing of information in the United States and other jurisdictions.\nWhere necessary under applicable law, we may employ appropriate cross-border transfer methods governing personal
