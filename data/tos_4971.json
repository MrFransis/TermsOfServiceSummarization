resources that individuals have requested.\nfor example, educational literature and related information about our business, e-mail programs, tools, quizzes, questionnaires, and surveys.\nWe analyze

identify and assess what is being said about a company, individual, product or brand on the Internet.\nWe will only collect relevant, adequate and not excessive publicly available personal

to collect and verify your contact details given the available information.\nReasonable efforts might entail identifying your contact details from the social media platform, if possible, or within the posting.\nMoreover, we will make reasonable efforts to provide you with a mechanism by which to opt-out of our data processing or exercise your rights as required by our policy and applicable regulations.\n</p>\n<p> We also collect personal information from the public domain for adverse event reporting purposes to fulfill our pharmacovigilance compliance requirements.\nThe basis for this
