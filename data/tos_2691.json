2020</dd>\n<dt>Introduction</dt>\n<dd>Your privacy is important to WPS Software Pte.\nLtd.\nand its affiliates (\"We\" or \"WPS\" or \"WPS Office\"),and to protect your privacy we developed a Privacy Policy, which explains how we use any personal data (\u201c<b>information</b>\u201d) we collect about you.\nIt describes:</dd>\n<ul>\n<li>what information we collect about you;</li>\n<li>how we use your information;</li>\n<li>who we share your information with;</li>\n<li>collection and use of Non-Personal Data;</li>\n<li>your rights regarding our use of your information.\n</li>\n<li>how long we keep your information.\nand</li>\n<li>how to contact us.</li>\n</ul>\n<dd>We provide this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information that we access in order to provide our \u201cServices\u201d.\nWhen we say Services in this Privacy Policy, we mean our websites located at http://www.wps.com, http://note.wps.com/ and other websites operated by us through which our Services are provided (\u201c<b>Sites</b>\u201d), our mobile device applications (\u201c<b>Apps</b>\u201d), and our software products available for use via the Apps or via installation on windows personal computers (collectively, the \u201c<b>Products</b>\u201d).\nThis Privacy Policy applies to only those websites, products, services and applications included within the \u201c<b>Services</b>\u201d and does not apply to any third-party websites, products, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.</dd>\n<dt>About Us</dt>\n<dd>WPS Office Software is a leading office productivity suite for PC and mobile devices, produced by WPS Office.\nWith more than 310 million MAU, WPS Office is a high performing, yet considerably more affordable solution available for Windows and Linux-based PCs as well as Android and macOS.\n</dd>\n<dt>Revision to this Privacy Policy</dt>\n<dd>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.\nWe may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in accordance with the law.\nIf we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting them on our websites or by sending you emails or other notifications, and we will update the Last Updated Date above to indicate when such changes became effective.</dd>\n<dt>What Information We Collect about You</dt>\n<dd>Your information is the data relating to you, which can be used to identify you directly or indirectly.\nWe collect and process your information to provide and improve our Services for you, to administer your use of our Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.\nWe will be transparent about the collection and use of your information so that you can make informed decisions.\nYou are not required to provide us with the information that we have requested, but if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our Products and Services or to respond to any queries you may have.</dd>\n<dd>We collect the following information about you:</dd>\n<dd>Basic Subscription Information.\nIf you create an account in connection with your use of any of the Services (\u201c<b>Account</b>\u201d or \u201c<b>WPS ID</b>\u201d), either through our Sites or when you download and install our Products, we\u2019ll collect certain information about you, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number and credit card information (\u201c<b>PII</b>\u201d).\nIf you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your accounts with certain third-party social networking services such as Google, Facebook or Twitter (each, an \u201c<b>SNS Account</b>\u201d), we\u2019ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.\nIf you create an Account, we may also collect other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.</dd>\n<dd>Information Collected Using Cookies and Other Web Technologies.\nLike many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</dd>\n<dd>\u201c<b>Cookies</b>\u201d are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services.\nWe may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you\u2019ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services.\nWe may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and Web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services.\nUnlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser.\nAlthough most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies.\nPlease note, however, that if you don\u2019t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services.\nSome third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive on the basis of related arrangement.\nPlease note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies but not use of Cookies by such third parties.</dd>\n<dd>\u201c<b>Web Beacons</b>\u201d (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising.\nUnlike Cookies which are stored on the user\u2019s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on Web pages (or in an e-mail).</dd>\n<dd>At the same time, our Services may include third-party tracking tools without limitation to individual cookies, APIs (application programming interface) and SDKs (software development kit) which belong to part of the third-party services providers on behalf of WPS to collect and analyze technical data

downloaded the advertiser\u2019s app;</li>\n<li>The metadata shared by you, such as shooting, uploaded sharing photos or videos, as well as exact date, time, place, and other data stored when using our Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<dd>Information Related to Use of the Services.\nOur servers automatically record certain data about how a person uses our Services (\u201c<b>Log Data</b>\u201d), including that of both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a \u201c<b>User</b>\u201d).\nLog Data may include certain data such as a User\u2019s IP address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our

our Services by expanding and tailoring features and functionalities of our Services to our Users\u2019 needs and preferences.\nWe may use a person\u2019s IP address to generate aggregate,
