from a linked bank account that you select during enrollment, in the amount and in such frequency (such as weekly or monthly) as you designate during enrollment, subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer (\u201cEFT\u201d) Authorization (see ACH terms below) to which you agree when you use Autopilot.\nWe will hold your funds in a custodial account as described below.\nWe will continue to automatically withdraw funds from your linked bank account to hold in the custodial account, unless you tell us to stop by using the Service by pausing your Autopilot goal, or if you close your Autopilot Savings Account, or if we are not able to process your transfer (e.g., if there are insufficient funds in your linked account).\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring your selected bank account has sufficient funds for each withdrawal at the time such funds are withdrawn.\nYou are also responsible for ensuring each savings amount designated by you is appropriate for your particular situation.\nIf you do not have sufficient funds in your selected bank account, you may incur an insufficient funds or overdraft fee from your bank, and we bear no liability for any fee that may be imposed by your bank.\nThe Autopilot feature is not a savings account and you will not earn any interest on your Autopilot funds.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>You remain the legal owner of the funds held for your benefit in the custodial account.\nHowever, you may not use your funds in your Autopilot Savings while held in the custodial account to make any purchases, withdraw cash (other than to transfer your funds back to your linked bank account), transfer funds to any third party, or for any other purpose.\nWe have no interest in or ownership of your Autopilot funds.\nWe will hold your Autopilot Savings funds for your benefit in a non-interest bearing custodial account we have established for your benefit at our bank partners or another FDIC-insured financial institution we may select.\nWe may from time to time move your Autopilot Savings funds from one custodial account to a custodial account at another insured depository institution, for liquidity, backup, storage or other lawful purposes, but this will not affect your ability to access your Autopilot funds, and you remain the legal owner of your funds held in the custodial account.\nFunds deposited in the Autopilot feature are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum allowed by law, which is currently $250,000 per for an individually-owned account and $250,000 per owner for jointly owned accounts.\nThe FDIC insures deposits according to the ownership category in which the funds are insured and how the accounts are titled.\nFor questions about FDIC insurance coverage, you may call the FDIC at 877-275-3342 or visit the FDIC\u2019s site at www.fdic.gov.\nYour Autopilot Savings funds will remain in the custodial account until you instruct us to transfer your funds back to your linked bank account.\nIt may take up to 5 Business Days from when we receive your request to complete the transfer.\nIt is important for you to know the amount of funds you have saved before you request a transfer to your linked bank account.\nIf you instruct us to transfer your funds back to your linked bank account and the amount of your requested transfer exceeds the amount of your Autopilot funds, your request will be declined.\nYou may check your Savings fund balance and initiate a transfer back to your linked bank account at any time by accessing your Autopilot through the Truebill app.\nYou authorize us to transfer your funds back to your selected bank account without notice to you if you terminate your participation in Autopilot, if you terminate your Truebill account, if we are required to do so under applicable law or by any government agency, or if we, in our sole discretion, suspect that your use of Savings is for illicit purposes or otherwise is in violation of these Terms.</p>\n<p>Truebill Autopilot Savings is free for Truebill Premium users.\nFor users who maintain a balance in their Autopilot Savings account who are not currently enrolled in Truebill Premium, Truebill will assess a $2.00 Smart Savings account maintenance fee per month.\nUsers who cancel their Truebill Premium subscription will be charged the $2.00 Autopilot Savings account maintenance fee beginning on the first day following the termination date of your Truebill Premium subscription.\nAccount maintenance fees are non-refundable.</p>\n<p>DEPOSIT NETWORK SERVICE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</p>\n<p>By utilizing the services, your beneficial funds may be held at nbkc bank in an omnibus custodial account (\"Omnibus Account\").\nIn its ordinary course of business, nbkc bank may utilize a \"Deposit Network Service\" to deposit funds from the Omnibus Account into other FDIC insured banks (\"Network Banks\").\nIn the event funds from the Omnibus Account are deposited into Network Banks via the Deposit Network Service, nbkc bank will deliver funds to a custody bank (\"Custodian Bank\") participating in the Deposit Network Service.\nIn the event any of your beneficial funds from the Omnibus Account arrive at a Network Bank through a Deposit Network Service, they may be eligible for FDIC insurance, however, in the event you or nbkc bank have funds, either directly or indirectly, at any of the Network Banks, such deposit insurance coverage may be adversely affected, and the principal and any accrued interest may not benefit from FDIC insurance, even if the total amount deposited in that Network Bank through the Deposit Network Service is less than the Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount, as then provided by the FDIC.\nIn addition, in the event of a failure of a Network Bank, you may be requested to provide certain personal information for the purposes of processing a claim to seek the associated FDIC insurance.\nIn the event you do not provide such information on a timely basis, it is possible the beneficial funds will not benefit from FDIC insurance.\nBy utilizing the services, you authorize nbkc bank to utilize a Deposit Network Service as described and acknowledge that any associated beneficial principal balance and any accrued interest may or may not benefit from FDIC insurance.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>Truebill Bill Presentment and Payment Services (Billpay

recommendations regarding financial products and services that may be of interest to me, including credit cards, personal loans, home loans and other financial products and services offered by Truebill partners.</p>\n<p>If you find discrepancies with your credit score or information from your credit report, please contact Experian directly.</p>\n<p>\u200d</p>About VantageScore 3.0<p>VantageScore 3.0, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by the three major nationwide credit reporting agencies, Experian\u00ae, TransUnion\u00ae, and Equifax\u00ae.\nVantageScore 3.0 is used by some but not all lenders.\nHigher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders.\nA lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.\n</p>\n<p>There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file.\nCredit scores are based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested.\nYour credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies.\nSo your credit scores can vary if the information they have on file for you is different.\nSince the information in your file can change over time, your credit scores also may be different from day-to-day.\nDifferent credit scoring models can also give a different assessment of the credit risk (risk of default) for the same consumer and same credit file.\nThere are different credit scoring models which may be used by lenders and insurers.\nYour lender may not use VantageScore 3.0, so don't be surprised if your lender gives you a score that's different from your VantageScore.\n(And your VantageScore 3.0 may differ from your score under other types of VantageScores).\nJust remember that your associated risk level is often the same even if the number is not.\nFor some consumers, however, the risk assessment of VantageScore 3.0 could vary, sometimes substantially, from a lender\u2019s score.\nIf the lender's score is lower than your VantageScore 3.0, it is possible that this difference can lead to higher interest rates and sometimes credit denial.</p>", "created_at": "2022-03-07 21:42:14.045561", "updated_at": "2022-03-07 20:43:44.018551"}], "points": [{"id": 27137, "title": "Do Not Track (DNT) headers are ignored and you are tracked
