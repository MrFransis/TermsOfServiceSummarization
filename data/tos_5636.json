2020</p>\n<p>HealthsToday owns and operates a number of different Website/App on mobile, TV, set top boxes, and other devices (each one or all together referred to as \u201cHealthsToday Website/App\u201d).\nThe Company is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community.\nThe intent of this privacy policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) is to detail the information the Company might gather about individuals who visit HealthsToday Website/App, how that information is used, and our disclosure practices.\nBy using any HealthsToday Website/App, you signify that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Use, which are incorporated by reference herein to this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Your Consent for Our Collection, Use and Disclosure</p>\n<p>Typically, we will seek consent for the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection.\nIn certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified).\nThe form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances.</p>\n<p>You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice.\nIf you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact us as set out below.\nWe will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.</p>\n<p>We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which the information is being provided.</p>\n<p>What Personal Information We Collect</p>\n<p>When you sign up for the HealthsToday Website/App you will be required to share information that identifies you personally.\n\u201cPersonal Information\u201d refers to any information that lets us know the specifics of who you are and which can be used to identify, contact or locate you.\nExamples of Personal Information include, without limitation, your first name together with your last name, your credit card number, your mailing address and/or email address, and your phone number.</p>\n<p>When We Collect Personal Information</p>\n<p>Generally, we collect Personal Information when you provide it to us by signing up on HealthsToday Website/App, filling out surveys or questionnaires, joining our mailing list, corresponding with us, entering one of our sweepstakes or contests, choosing to submit testimonials, stories, photos or the like to the HealthsToday Website/App, or otherwise volunteering information about yourself.</p>\n<p>The Company usually collects Personal Information so that it can provide you with the Company\u2019s goods or services.\nThe Company may also use your Personal Information for other reasons, including updating you on the Company\u2019s services, news and special offers (unless you choose to \u201copt-out\u201d as described in the \u201cChoice/Opt-out\u201d section below).</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t provide some of the Personal Information the Company asks for (e.g.\nyour name, your mailing address and/or email address), it may be unable to provide you with the Company\u2019s goods or services.</p>\n<p>Anonymous User Information</p>\n<p>The Company collects or may collect some information each time you visit HealthsToday Website/App so we can improve the overall quality of your online experience.\nWe collect or may collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and platform type.\nYou do not have to register on the HealthsToday Website/App or provide any Personal Information to us before we can collect this anonymous information.\nThe Company assigns an anonymous ID number to your requests and links the following additional data to that anonymous ID number: the date and time you visited, your search terms, and the links you choose to click.\nLike most standard servers, we use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information.\nThe Company analyzes the information to determine trends, administer the site, track user\u2019s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>\n<p>Such aggregated anonymous information is used in our market research surveys, offers, and other activities.</p>\n<p>Correspondence</p>\n<p>If you contact the Company, we may keep a record of that correspondence and we may collect your email address for archival purposes but will not use, transfer or sell your email address except as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Third Party Advertisements</p>\n<p>The HealthsToday Website/App may contain links to various other Website/App that are not owned by the Company.\nWhile the Company makes every effort to ensure that its advertisers post clear and complete privacy policies and observe appropriate data practices, each of these Website/App has a privacy policy that may differ from that of the Company.\nThe privacy practices of other Website and companies are not covered by this Privacy Policy.\nPlease be aware that the Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other Website/App.\nThe Company encourages you to be aware when you leave the HealthsToday Website/App and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collect personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>The Company may allow other companies, called third party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on

information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.\nThe Company does not have access to or control over the cookies that may be placed by these parties on your device, and has no control over these parties\u2019 privacy policies or information collection practices.</p>\n<p>Except as specifically set forth in this Privacy Policy, the Company does not to provide your Personal Information to its advertisers unless you make the choice to share it with them.\nThe Company occasionally passes Personally Identifiable Information via a secure interface to certain of its advertisers for the purpose of making it easier for you to sign up for their offers.\nHowever, this information is only to be used by the advertiser if you agree to submit the information to the advertiser for the purposes of completing an offer.</p>\n<p>In the event that the Company is unable to capture your transaction detail, the Company may need to validate your transaction with an advertiser or merchant partner to ensure that your account is credited.\nThe validation information shared is used solely for this purpose and may include your first name, last name, email address, mailing address or date of birth.\nThe Company will require that these third parties comply with the information practices set forth in this Privacy Policy and that the information not be shared or used for any other purpose.</p>\n<p>The Company may share non-personally identifiable information collected via the service in aggregate, anonymous form with advertisers or other third parties so that they may better evaluate what products and services are most appealing to different segments of the Company\u2019s user base.\nThe Company does not
