customer service department, and when an individual voluntarily subscribes to the Site's service or newsletter (together, \"Other Information\").<br>\n<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.\nAutomated collection of information<br>\n<br> The Site currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related information about an individual with information about the individual in our database.\nAdditionally, The Site may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future (together, \"Technology Information\").<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nCookies.\nA cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's computer that allows The Site to identify the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides in the Site 's database.\nYou may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com.\nIndividuals who use the Websites need to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the Websites.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWeb Beacons.\nA web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by using an programming function -- see http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about an individual in a database.\nThis allows&nbsp.\nThe Site to track certain website an individual visits online.\nWeb beacons are used to determine products or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes.\nFor example, The Site might place, with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third Party's website where shoes are sold.\nWhen Joe, an individual listed in The Site's database, visits the shoe website,&nbsp.\nThe Site receives notice by means of the web beacon that Joe visited the shoe the Site, and&nbsp.\nThe Site would then update Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in shoes.&nbsp.\nThe Site may thereafter present offers of shoe related products and services to Joe.\nIn addition to using web beacons on its and its affiliates web pages,&nbsp.\nThe Site also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in The Site's database.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nNew Technology.\nThe use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is The Site's use of new and evolving technology.\nAs a result, The Site strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nUsage Tracking and Log Files.&nbsp.\nThe Site tracks information related to the electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails or visiting our websites.\nLog files are used to track and monitor subscriber usage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIP Address.\nWe collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, to gather information on your proximity to improve the Site experience and to administer The Site.\nAn IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.\nYour IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nb.vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nClear GIFs.\nWe use a common technology known as a \"Clear GIF\" or \"1-by-1 Pixel\" on the Site and in e-mail communications with users.\nA Clear GIF or \"graphic interface format\" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of the Site.\nWe may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we send to users.\nGIFs, which do not contain any PII, provide us with important information about how users use the Site and respond to e-mail messages.\nWith this information, we are better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations.\nWe may also allow our advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track users who link from their respective the Sites to this The Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to user PII.<br>\n<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nc.\nOutside Information.\nThe Site may receive information about individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information outside of&nbsp.\nThe Site including information located in public databases (\"Outside Information\").&nbsp.\nThe Site will not use your information to pull a credit bureau report without your permission.<br>\n<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nd.\nNo Information Collected from Children.\nThe Site will never knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13.\nIf&nbsp.\nThe Site obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from our database.\nBecause it does not collect such information,&nbsp.\nThe Site has no such information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.&nbsp.\nThe Site is designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\").<br>\n<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\ne.\nLinks to External Websites.\nThe Site's mails and websites contain links to external websites.\nYou will be taken to external websites if
