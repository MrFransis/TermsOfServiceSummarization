TRANSFERS\n<p>Cloudflare is a U.S.-based, global company.\nWe primarily store your information in the United States and the European Economic Area.\nTo facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world, including from other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for the purposes described in this Policy.</p>\n<p>Whenever Cloudflare shares personal information originating in the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland with a Cloudflare entity outside the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, we will do so on the basis of the EU standard contractual clauses (adjusted to address transfers from the UK).</p>\n<p>If you are accessing or using our Websites or Services or otherwise providing information to us, we may transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland, ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal information.\nWe describe our additional safeguards here.\nIf you have any questions about or need further information concerning the appropriate safeguards Cloudflare has in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at privacyquestions@cloudflare.com.</p>\n<p>While Cloudflare no longer relies on the EU-U.S.\nand the Swiss -U.S.\nPrivacy Shield as a lawful basis for international transfers of personal data from the EEA and Switzerland to the U.S., Cloudflare remains certified under both the EU-U.S.\nand the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Frameworks respectively as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland to the United States, respectively (\u201cPrivacy Shields\u201d).\nWe commit to periodically review and verify the accuracy of our policies and our compliance with the Privacy Shields.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nFor more information on the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield or Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield, please visit the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Privacy Shield website at: https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome.</p>\n<p>If you believe that we maintain copies of your personal data within the scope of the Privacy Shields, you may direct any inquiries to SAR@cloudflare.com or via mail to: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Data Protection Officer.\nWe will respond to your inquiry within 30 days of receipt and verification of your identity.\n</p>\n<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.\nIf neither we nor our dispute resolution provider are able to resolve your complaint, as a last resort you may engage in binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel.</p>\n<p>Our commitments under the Privacy Shields are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission.\nWe may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\nUnder such circumstances, we may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of disclosure.\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n8.\nDATA SUBJECT RIGHTS AND CHOICES\n<p>For any subject access request (\"SAR\"), we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about their own information before we can assist.\nWhere a SAR may implicate the personal data of another individual, we must balance the request against the risk of violating another person\u2019s privacy rights.\nWe will comply with SARs to the extent required by applicable law or the US-Swiss or US-EU Privacy Shield.\nIn the EEA, the UK, and Switzerland, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Attendees, Website Visitors, Customers, Administrators, and Registrants.</strong> You have the right to access, correct, update, export, or delete your personal information.\nYou may email us at SAR@cloudflare.com with any such subject access requests (\u201cSAR\u201d), and we will respond within thirty (30) days.\nCustomers and Administrators also can access, correct, export, or update their Account Information by editing their profile or organization record at cloudflare.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Public DNS Resolver Users.</strong> We do not retain any personal information about 1.1.1.1 resolver users that would be subject to the data subject rights described above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>End Users.</strong> Cloudflare has no direct relationship with End Users.\nEven where \u201cCloudflare\u201d may be indicated as the authoritative name server for a domain, unless Cloudflare is the owner of that domain, we have no control over a domain\u2019s content.\nAccordingly, we rely upon our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements for subject access requests.\nIf an End User requests that we access, correct, update, or delete their information, or no longer wishes to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our Services, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer website(s) with which they interacted directly.\nOur Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their website users.</p>\n<br>\n9.\nCOMMUNICATION PREFERENCES\n<p>Cloudflare will send you commercial communications based on the communication preferences in your account settings.\nCloudflare also will send you service-related communications.\nYou may manage your receipt of commercial communications by clicking on the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link located on the bottom of such emails, through your account settings if you have a Cloudflare account, or you may send a request to unsubscribe@cloudflare.com.\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n10.\nDATA SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY AND ACCESS\n<p>We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and/or destruction.\nWe have put in place appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to safeguard and secure your information, and we make use of privacy-enhancing technologies such as encryption.\nIf you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at privacyquestions@cloudflare.com.\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n11.\nNOTIFICATION OF CHANGES\n<p>If we make changes to this Policy that we believe materially impact the privacy of your personal information, we will promptly provide notice of any such changes (and, where necessary, obtain consent), as well as post the updated Policy on this website noting the effective date of any changes.\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n12.\nBUSINESS TRANSACTIONS\n<p>We may assign or transfer this Policy, as well as information covered by this Policy, in the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or reorganization of all or part of our business.\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n13.\nENGLISH LANGUAGE CONTROLS\n<p>Non-English translations of this Policy are provided for convenience only.\nIn the event of any ambiguity or conflict between translations, the English version is authoritative and controls.\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n14.\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION\n<p>If you have an

Affiliates agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the Entity remain fully liable for such Affiliates\u2019 actions and omissions in connection with this Agreement as if the Entity had performed such acts and omissions itself.\n\u201cAffiliate\u201d means any means an entity which, directly or indirectly, owns or controls, is owned or is controlled by or is under common ownership or control with a party, where \u201ccontrol\u201d means the power to direct the management or affairs of an entity, and \u201cownership\u201d means the beneficial ownership of 50% (or, if the applicable jurisdiction does not allow majority ownership, the maximum amount permitted under such law) or more of the voting equity securities or other equivalent voting interests of the entity.</p>\n2.2

Services to store or transmit any \u201cprotected health information\u201d as that term is defined in 45 C.F.R.\n160.103 without Cloudflare\u2019s written consent.</p>\n2.3 Credentials\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all usernames, passwords, and other access credentials (such as API tokens and OAuth credentials) created by or assigned to you (\u201c<strong>Credentials</strong>\u201d) and are solely responsible for all activities that occur with such Credentials.</p>\n<p>If you permit third parties to access your Cloudflare account (e.g.,

(Security)</strong>, we assume no responsibility or liability for Your Information, and you will be solely responsible for the consequences of using, disclosing, storing, transferring or transmitting Your Information.</p>\n2.5.3\n<p>Cloudflare may modify certain components of Your Information on or transmitted to or from your website to enhance your website\u2019s performance or security or the functionality of the Cloud Services.\nFor example, depending on the Cloudflare Services you select or the Apps that you enable, Cloudflare may: (i) intercept requests determined to be threats and take actions, such as, presenting them with a challenge page, dropping the request, presenting alternative content, redirecting and other similar measures.\n(ii) add cookies to your domain to track visitors, such as those who have successfully passed the CAPTCHA on a challenge page.\n(iii) add scripts to your pages to perform additional performance tracking.\n(iv) add firewall rules to your website.\nand (v) make other changes to increase the performance, security or analytic capabilities of your website.\nCloudflare will make it clear whenever a feature will materially modify Your

warrant that Your Information does not infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right.</p>\n2.6 Free &amp.\nTrial Services\n<p>We may offer free or trial versions of the Cloud Services (\u201cFree Services\u201d) from

may immediately suspend or restrict your use of the Services, or limit End User access to certain of your resources through the Services.</p>\n3.\nSoftware\n3.1 License Grant\n<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Cloudflare grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable (except to Affiliates (as defined above)) license to install and use the Software during your use of the applicable Cloud Services in accordance with this Agreement and any Cloudflare documentation (\u201c<strong>License</strong>\u201d).\nYour License will end upon

have additional terms and restrictions regarding such software\u2019s use.</p>\n3.2 Limitations\n<p>You will not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, techniques, processes, algorithms, know-how or other information from the binary code portions of the Software (collectively, \"<strong>Reverse Engineering</strong>\") or permit or induce the foregoing.\nIf however, directly applicable law prohibits enforcement of the foregoing, you may engage in Reverse Engineering solely for purposes of obtaining such information as is necessary to achieve interoperability of your own or third party software with the Software, and to the limited extent permitted by directly applicable law, but only if: (a) Reverse Engineering is strictly necessary to obtain such information.\nand (b) you have first requested such information from us and we fail to make such information available (for a fee or otherwise) under reasonable terms and conditions.</p>\n3.3 Software Modifications\n<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, for any elements of the Software provided to you in source code form you may modify such source code solely to the extent necessary to support your permitted use of the Software (collectively, \u201c<strong>Modifications</strong>\u201d).\nUnless expressly stated otherwise, you may not distribute your Modifications to any third party.\nCloudflare has no support, warranty, indemnification or other obligation or liability with respect to your Modifications or their combination, interaction or use with our Cloud Services.\nYou agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim brought against us by a third party relating to your Modifications.</p>\n3.4 Third Party Products and Services\n<p>You

limited to, third-party apps provided on Cloudflare Apps, third-party service integrations made available through the Cloudflare dashboard or APIs, and third-party products or services that you authorize to access your Cloudflare account using OAuth or other Credentials.\nCloudflare does not make any representations, warranties, or guarantees regarding the Third Party Products and the

IS\u201d and \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d basis, and Cloudflare may cease providing it without entitling you to any refund, credit, or other compensation.\nEach Third Party Product is governed by the terms of service, end user license agreement, privacy policies, and/or any other applicable terms and policies of the third party provider.\nYour access or use of a Third Party Product is solely between you and the applicable Third Party Product provider.\nCloudflare will not be directly or indirectly responsible or liable to you in any manner, for any harms, damages, loss, lost profits, special or consequential damages, or claims, arising out of or in connection with the installation of, use of, or reliance on the performance of any of the Third Party Products.\nFurther information related to the apps available via Cloudflare Apps is available on the Cloudflare Apps page located here.</p>\n4.\nBilling\n4.1 Recurring Billing\n<p>In order to access those Services for which we require a fee (\u201c<strong>Paid Services</strong>\u201d) you will be required to provide Cloudflare with your credit card information (\u201c<strong>Payment Method</strong>\u201d).\nBy providing a Payment Method you are authorizing us to charge your Payment Method on a monthly, annual basis, or pay-as-you-go basis, or as otherwise applicable for the fees associated with the Paid Services that you sign up for.\nAny Payment Method that you provide us must be valid, and kept current by you during the Subscription Term.\nBy providing us with a Payment Method, you represent and warrant that you

fully configured the Paid Services as of that date.</p>\n4.2 Price Changes\n<p>We reserve the right to change the fees that we charge for the Service, at any time in our sole discretion, provided that we give you at least thirty (30) days\u2019 prior notice of such changes.\nUnless otherwise specified in such notice to you, any changes to the subscription fees will take effect in the billing period immediately following our notice to you.</p>\n4.3 No Refunds\n<p>FEES ARE NONREFUNDABLE.\nYOU WILL BE BILLED IN FULL FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION TERM IN WHICH YOU CANCEL AND NO REFUNDS WILL BE PROVIDED FOR THE UNUSED PORTION OF SUCH SUBSCRIPTION TERM.\nFollowing any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the Paid Services through the end of your current Subscription Term.\nWe may, in our sole discretion, provide a refund, discount, or credit (\u201c<strong>Credits</strong>\u201d) to you in a specific instance, however the provision of Credits in a specific instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances or obligate us to provide additional Credits.</p>\n4.4 Taxes\n<p>Unless otherwise stated, our charges do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments, including value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes assessable by any local, state, provincial or foreign jurisdiction (collectively \u201cTaxes\u201d).\nYou are responsible for paying Taxes, except those assessable against Cloudflare as measured by our net income.\nUnless you provide us with evidence of an exemption, we will invoice you for such Taxes if we believe we have a legal obligation to do so and you agree to pay such Taxes if so invoiced.</p>\n5.\nBeta Services\n<p>From time to time, we may make early stage or non-production Cloud Services and Software (\u201c<strong>Beta Services</strong>\u201d) available to you at no charge.\nYou may access these Beta Services in your sole discretion.\nBeta Services are intended for evaluation purposes only, and may be subject to additional terms that will be presented to you at the time of sign-up.\nCloudflare may, but is not obligated to, provide you with support for the Beta Services or correct any bugs, defects, or errors in the Beta Services.\nUnless otherwise stated, any Beta Services trial period will expire upon the earlier of one year from the trial start date or the date that a version of the Beta Services becomes generally available without the applicable Beta Services designation.\nWe may discontinue Beta Services at any time in our sole discretion and may never make them generally available.\nNotwithstanding <strong>Section 12</strong>, we will have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with any Beta Services.</p>\n6.\nData Processing and Security\n6.1 Data Processing\nIf Your Information includes the personal data of European data subjects as those terms are defined by EU and UK Data Protection Laws, then Cloudflare is a data processor or sub-processor, as applicable, and Cloudflare\u2019s Data Processing Addendum is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.\n\u201cEU and UK Data Protection Laws\u201d means all laws and regulations of the European Union, the European Economic Area, their member states, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, applicable to the processing of Personal Data including (where applicable), the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, the UK Data Protection Act and the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data).\n6.2 Security\n<p>We implement security procedures to help protect Your Information from security threats.\nHowever, you understand that your use of the Service necessarily involves transmission of Your Information over networks that are not owned, operated or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for any of Your Information that is lost, altered, intercepted or stored across such networks.\nWe cannot guarantee that our security procedures will be error-free, that transmissions of Your Information will always be secure or that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or those of our third party service providers.</p>\n7.\nTrade Sanctions and Export Control\n<p>You may not use the Service for any reason if you or any party that owns or controls you, are subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the U.S.\nGovernment (e.g., the Specially Designated Nationals List and Foreign Sanctions Evaders List of the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury, and the Entity List of the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce), the European Union or its Member States, or other applicable government authority.\nYou may not use the Service to export or re-export any information or technology to any country, individual, or entity to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited.</p>\n8.\nTermination of Use.\nDiscontinuation and Modification of the Service\n<p>You will lose your license to use the Service if you violate any provision of this Agreement.\nCloudflare\u2019s policy is to investigate violations of this Agreement.\nWe reserve the right to suspend or terminate your user account upon receiving any number of DMCA notifications from content owners regarding your website(s), or upon learning through other means that you are a repeat infringer.\nAdditionally, we may at our sole discretion terminate your user account or suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice for any reason or no reason at all.\nWe also reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Service at any time (including, without limitation, by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Service) without notice to you.\nWe will have no liability whatsoever on account of any change to the Service or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Service.\nYou may terminate your account at any time through the Service\u2019s account dashboard.</p>\n9.\nOwnership.\nProprietary Rights\n<p>The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code (including source code or object code), products, software, services, and all other elements of the Service (the

are the property of Cloudflare or our third-party licensors.\nExcept as expressly authorized by Cloudflare you may not make use of the Materials.\nCloudflare reserves all rights to the Materials not granted expressly in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>You hereby grant Cloudflare a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, irrevocable, sublicensable, and perpetual license to use or incorporate into the Services any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations, corrections, or other feedback (<strong>\u201cFeedback\u201d</strong>) you provide to Cloudflare relating to the Services.</p>\n10.\nIndemnification\n10.1 By Cloudflare\n<p>Cloudflare will defend you against any third party claim brought against you, to the extent that such claim is based on an allegation that a Paid Service, when used as authorized under this Agreement, infringes a United States or European Union patent or registered copyright (a \"<strong>Claim</strong>\"), and we will indemnify you against any damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) finally awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction attributable to such a Claim or agreed to settlement by Cloudflare.\nIf any portion of a Paid Service becomes, or in Cloudflare\u2019s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Cloudflare may, at Cloudflare\u2019s option: (a) procure the right for you to continue using the Paid Service.\n(b) replace the Paid Service with non-infringing services which do not materially impair the functionality of the Paid Service.\n(c) modify the Paid Service so that it becomes non-infringing.\nor (d) terminate the Paid Service and refund any pre-paid subscription fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term, and upon such termination, you will immediately cease all use of the Paid Service.\nCloudflare will have no obligation under this <strong>Section 10</strong> or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon: (w) any use of a Paid Service not in accordance with this Agreement or the applicable Cloudflare documentation.\nany use of a Paid Service in combination with third party products or services not supplied by Cloudflare.\nor (z) any modification of a Paid Service by any person other than Cloudflare or its authorized agents.\nTHIS SUBSECTION SETS FORTH CLOUDFLARE\u2019S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS, AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS OF INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>\n10.2 By You\n<p>You agree that you will be responsible for your use of the Service, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Cloudflare and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, Affiliates (as defined above), subsidiaries and agents (collectively, the \"<strong>Cloudflare Entities</strong>\") from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Service.\n(ii) your violation of this Agreement or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation.\n(iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right.\nor (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third party.\nWe reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.</p>\n11.\nDisclaimers.\nNo Warranties\n<p>THE SERVICE ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS, WITH THE EXPRESS UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CLOUDFLARE ENTITIES HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO MONITOR, CONTROL, OR VET USER CONTENT OR DATA.\nAS SUCH,

VULNERABILITIES.</p>\n<p>THE CLOUDFLARE ENTITIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p>\n12.\nLimitation of Liability\n<p>IN NO EVENT WILL THE CLOUDFLARE ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT THE CLOUDFLARE ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>\n<p>YOU AGREE THAT THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE CLOUDFLARE ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES) OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO CLOUDFLARE TO ACCESS AND USE THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM.</p>\n<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.\nACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n13.\nGoverning Law\n<p>This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law principles.\nTo the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Cloudflare agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County, California for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>\n14.\nChanges to this Agreement\n<p>Cloudflare reserves the right to make modifications to this Agreement at any time.\nIf a revision materially alters your rights we will use reasonable efforts to contact you, including

binding for all users of the Service.</p>\n16.\nGeneral\n<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Cloudflare regarding your use of and access to the Service.\nYou may not assign or transfer this Agreement or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.\nWe may assign this Agreement at any time without notice.\nThe failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any time thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.\nUse of section headers in this Subscription Agreement is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions.\nIn the event that any part of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.\nUpon termination of this Agreement, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, <strong>Sections 2.5.1</strong> and <strong>Sections 9</strong> through <strong>19</strong>.</p>\n17.\nDispute Resolution and Arbitration\n17.1 Generally\n<p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Cloudflare in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Cloudflare agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nOur agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CLOUDFLARE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n17.2 Exceptions\n<p>Notwithstanding <strong>Subsection 17.1</strong>, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>\n17.3 Arbitrator\n<p>Any arbitration between you and Cloudflare will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures (\"<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"<strong>AAA</strong>\"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>\n17.4 Notice.\nProcess\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"<strong>Notice</strong>\").\nCloudflare's address for Notice is: Cloudflare, Inc., 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107.\nThe Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (\"<strong>Demand</strong>\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Cloudflare may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>\n17.5 Fees\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, CA provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse Cloudflare for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n17.6 No Class Actions\n<p>YOU AND CLOUDFLARE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Cloudflare agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n17.7 Modifications\n<p>In the event that Cloudflare makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Cloudflare's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Cloudflare's address for Notice, in which case your account with Cloudflare will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject will survive.</p>\n17.8 Enforceability\n<p>If <strong>Subsection 17.1</strong> is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this <strong>Section 17</strong> is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this <strong>Section 17</strong> will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in <strong>Section 13</strong> will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.</p>\n18.\nConsent to Electronic Communications\n<p>By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy.\nPlease read our Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our electronic communications practices.\nYou agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.</p>\n19.\nContact Information\n<p>The Service is offered by Cloudflare, Inc., located at 101 Townsend St., San Francisco, California 94107.\nYou may contact us by sending correspondence to the foregoing address or by emailing us at support@cloudflare.com.\nIf you are a California resident, you may have this Agreement mailed to you electronically by sending a letter to the foregoing address with your electronic mail address and a request for this Agreement.</p>\n20.\nPublicity\n<p>You agree to allow us to identify you as a customer, to use your website\u2019s name in connection with proposals to prospective customers, to hyperlink to your website\u2019s home page, to display your logo on the Cloudflare website, and to otherwise refer to you in print or electronic form for marketing or reference purposes.\nIf you do not wish for Cloudflare to use your name or logo in any of the preceding ways, please contact support@cloudflare.com.</p> Legal <ul>\n<li> Website Terms of
