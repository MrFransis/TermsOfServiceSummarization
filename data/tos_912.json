existence.\nWe also believe just as strongly that you have the right to privacy and control over your information.\nThis fundamental belief shapes our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We will be clear about the data we collect and why.\nWe do not and will not sell your data to third parties.\nOur primary purpose in collecting your data is to be able to equip you with effective products and services that provide a more agile, dynamic response to new and unknown threats.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Malwarebytes websites and products and describes how Malwarebytes collects, uses, shares and secures your personal information.\nIt also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.\n</p>\n<p>Please, if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact us at privacy@malwarebytes.com.</p>\n<p>Caution: Legalese ahead.</p> When do we collect your information? <p>We may collect your information: (1) when you license and use our software (\"Software Collection\").\n(2) when you interact with certain portions of our website, such as our forums, blogs, and support center (\"Website Collection\").\n(3) when you communicate with us by email, chat, or otherwise (\"Dialogue Collection\").\nand (4) when you apply to work for us (\u201cJob Applicant Collection\u201d)</p> Simply <p>We collect your information when you use our software, website, or otherwise communicate with us.\n</p> What information do we collect? <p>We may collect both personal information and non-personal information.\npersonal information is information that is either expressly provided by you, such as your name, or information that can be used either alone or in combination with other information to personally identify you, such as your email address, phone number, and user name.\n</p>\n<p>We may collect the following personal information from you: Contact Information (such as name, email address, mailing address, or phone number).\nUnique Identifiers (such as username and password used for authenticating your Malwarebytes accounts and products) and machine identification number.\nInformation about your business (such as company name, company size, business type) and.\nInformation related to your usage of our products as described in the next section, below.\n</p>\n<p>Our service providers may collect billing information (credit card number and billing address) on our behalf to process orders.\n</p>\n<p>Non-personal information is all information that is not personal information or is information that was personal information but which we modify and/or aggregate with other data in order to make it Non-personal information.\nAs is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically.\nThis information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the aggregate, and anonymously generated device identifiers and administer the site.</p> Simply <p>There are two types of information we collect: personal and non-personal.</p> Software Collection \u2013 information collected when using our security software User-Agent String <p>Each API communication coming from any of our client software identifies itself with a string that includes information about the software itself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The program and build which is sending the request</li>\n<li>The current license state (as identified by the product)</li>\n<li>The version of the software as well as any subcomponents (currently, databases) that it uses</li>\n</ul> Why? <p>So we can manage your Malwarebytes product and ensure that it is up to date.</p> GeoIP Data <p>When we collect data from our client systems, we do not store IP address from which the request originates.\nHowever, we do use it to gather geographic information on the system calling in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A location item indicating the continent, country, city, and approximate latitude/ longitude of the user based on your IP address</li>\n<li>The type of connection (dialup/broadband/satellite/mobile)</li>\n<li>The ISP through which the connection is made </li>\n<li>The organization to which the IP address is licensed, if any</li>\n</ul> Why? <p>So our malware intelligence team can track malware and potentially unwanted program (\"PUP\") outbreaks and patterns.</p> Functional Data <p>We collect data that is necessary for the functionality of the software or for our performance of providing the software to you.\nFor example, we may need to collect system processes and behaviors in order to perform system rollback and recovery operations.</p> Why? <p>So our products are able to function as intended, including being able to detect and remediate malware and PUPs, and provide rollback and recovery operations.</p> Client Data <p>In addition to functional data, we collect client data from each program that describe the client environment (i.e., our software and the computer system it is running on).\nIn this, we collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The operating system the program is installed on </li>\n<li>The system language in use on that system </li>\n<li>The processor architecture (i.e., 32- or 64-bit)</li>\n<li>The file system in use (i.e., FAT32)</li>\n<li>Information from the Windows Security/Action Center, including security settings and programs installed or in use</li>\n<li>Information about other Malwarebytes program settings and how they are configured</li>\n<li>Information about how you use our software or services (\"Log Data\")</li>\n</ul> Why? <p>So we can gather performance data around our products and how they operate in relation to different hardware and software environments.\nBy having this data, we can improve our products as well as optimize them for the various system configurations that our users are using.</p> Machine Identification Data <p>We identify each system by assigning each system with a Malwarebytes-generated distinct identifier that is created at install time.</p> Why? <p>So we are able to get an accurate count of our install base.\nWe are also able to identify changes to an individual system over time, allowing us to recognize trends which are used for improving our products.</p> License Data <p>We collect data from products corresponding to the products' applicable license state.\nThese data also use a unique identifier.\nIn this, we collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The key or keys used to license the current product </li>\n<li>The type of license being used </li>\n<li>If it represents a console system, the number of seats being managed by that installation of the console</li>\n<li>Endpoint and network domain information</li>\n</ul> Why? <p>So we can remind you when your Malwarebytes subscription is about to expire or to determine the correct license type.\nWe may use such license data in conjunction with other software collection to assist you in resolving licensing issues.</p> Malware and PUP Data <p>We collect data about the malware and PUPs that are detected by our products.\nWe collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The vendor name of the malware or PUP removed </li>\n<li>An encrypted description of which database rule was used to

of the trial provided </li>\n<li>Any attempted conversion/purchase generated by clicking an in-app link, so that it can be correlated with a trial</li>\n</ul> Why? <p>So we can update your Malwarebytes products accurately and when they need it.</p> Exploit Data <p>In Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit products we collect a complex data object for any exploit process which is blocked by the software.\nIn this data we collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process ID of the exploit process </li>\n<li>File path of exploit process </li>\n<li>MD5 hash of the exploit payload, if any</li>\n<li>Command-line arguments passed to the exploit</li>\n<li>A list of URLs potentially associated with the exploit, including redirect jumps if any </li>\n<li>Exploit payload files </li>\n<li>Exploit file-format (doc, pdf, xls, etc\u2026)</li>\n<li>(Potentially) a copy of the exploit executable itself</li>\n</ul> Why? <p>So our malware intelligence team can track exploit outbreaks and deepen its understanding of

the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.</p>\n<p>As part of our text message filtering functionality, our Mobile Software also collects text messages from senders who are not in your contacts, and analyzes these text messages to determine whether they are malicious.\nWe only receive the sender information and the body of the message which
