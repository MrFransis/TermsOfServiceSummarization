DISPUTES, BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.\nFOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE PROVISIONS REQUIRING YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(A) Disputes.</b> The terms of this Section shall apply to all Disputes between you and Company, except for disputes governed by the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy referenced above and available here.\nFor the purposes of this Section, \u201cDispute\u201d shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and Company arising under or relating to any Services, Sites, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and Company, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law.\nYOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT \u201cDISPUTE\u201d AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR COMPANY FOR (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION.\nMoreover, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(B) Binding Arbitration.</b> You and Company further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms.\n(ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce.\n(iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a71, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\nand (iv) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms.\nARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED.\nThe arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nIn addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nThe decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(C) Small Claims Court.</b> Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court\u2019s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(D) Dispute Notice.</b> In the event of a Dispute, you or Company must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the \u201cDispute Notice\u201d).\nThe Dispute Notice to Company must be addressed to: GoDaddy Media Temple, Inc.\nd/b/a Sucuri, 6060 Center Dr.\nSuite 500, Los Angeles CA 90045, Attn.: Legal Department (the \u201cSucuri Notice Address\u201d).\nThe Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you.\nIf Company and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section.\nFollowing submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.</p>\n<p>(E) WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.\nYOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS.\nNEITHER YOU NOR COMPANY WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OF PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.\nNO ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(F) Arbitration Procedure.</b> If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) and governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d) in conjunction with the rules set forth in these Terms, except that AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims.\nThe AAA Rules are at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nIf there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms shall govern.\nYou may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement.\nAll Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator is bound by these Terms.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.\nThe arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nNotwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of \u201cDisputes\u201d as stated above.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nYou may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone.\nArbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence (or principal place of business if you are a small business), or in Los Angeles County, California, at your option.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(G) Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding.</b> If either you or Company decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to the following procedure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write a Demand for Arbitration.\nThe demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.\nYou can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org (\u201cDemand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules\u201d).</li>\n<li>Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA by mail at American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.</li>\n<li>Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<b>(H) Hearing Format.</b> In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Company or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Company is entitled.\nThe discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(I) Arbitration Fees and Payments.</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Disputes involving $75,000 or less.\nCompany will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\nIf you reject Company\u2019s last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed (\u201cCompany\u2019s last written offer\u201d), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator\u2019s decision (called an \u201caward\u201d), and the arbitrator awards you more than Company\u2019s last written offer, Company will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.\n(ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, if any.\nand (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.\nThe arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and Company agree on them.</li>\n<li>Disputes involving more than $75,000.\nThe AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.</li>\n<li>Disputes involving any amount.\nIn any arbitration you commence, Company will seek its AAA or arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.\nIn any arbitration Company commences, Company will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\nCompany will not seek its attorney\u2019s fees or expenses from you in any arbitration.\nFees and expenses are not included in determining the amount in dispute.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<b>(J) Claims or Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year.</b> To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute to which this Section applies must be filed within one year in small claims or in arbitration.\nThe one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.\nIf not filed within one year, the claim or dispute will be permanently barred.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(K) 30-Day Opt-out Period.</b> IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS DISPUTES SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY COMPANY BY E-MAILING LEGALOPTOUT@GODADDY.COM WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS (UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW).\nIn the e-mail, you must provide your (a) first name, (b) last name (c) address, (d) phone number, and (e) account number(s) and state the following: \u201cI wish to opt out of the arbitration provision contained in Sucuri\u2019s Terms of Service.\u201d By providing your information in the method above, you are opting out of the agreement to arbitrate contained in Company\u2019s Terms of Service.\nYour opt-out request will only be valid if made within thirty (30) days of first accepting the Terms of Service.\nIn the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms shall contained herein shall continue to apply, including those related to the applicable governing law and the court(s) in which legal disputes may be brought.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(L) Amendments to this Section.</b> Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and Company agree that if Company makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to Company\u2019s address) in these Terms, Company will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments.\nIf you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in these current Terms, without any of the proposed amendments governing.\nIf you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(M) Severability.</b> If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect.\nThe foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions.\nif the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void.\nThe terms of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(N) Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies.</b> Company and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the State of California, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.\nYou also agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any such action or proceeding.</p> Integration and Severability <p>The titles and headings of this Agreement are for convenience and ease of reference only and shall not be utilized in any way to construe or interpret the agreement of the parties as otherwise set forth herein.\nEach covenant and agreement in this Agreement shall be construed for all purposes to be a separate and independent covenant or agreement.\nIf a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision (or portion of a provision) of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions (or portions of provisions) of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby and shall be found to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p> General <p>\n<b>International Users.</b> The Sites can be accessed from countries around the world and may contain references to services and content that are not available in your country.\nThese references do not imply that Company intends to announce such services or content in your country.\nThe Sites and the Service are controlled and offered by Company from its facilities in the United States of America.\nCompany makes no representations that the Sites or the Service are appropriate or available for use in other locations.\nThose who access or use the Sites or the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Notice.</b> Where Company requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing Company with your most current e-mail address.\nIn the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Company is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/permitted by the Terms, Company\u2019s dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.\nYou may give notice to Company addressed to the attention of Chief Operating Officer, 6060 Center Dr.\nSuite 500, Los Angeles CA 90045.\nSuch notice shall be deemed given when received by Company by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Waiver.</b> Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Assignment.</b> These Terms, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company\u2019s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.</p>\n<p>\n<b>English Language Controls.</b> This Agreement, along with all policies and the applicable product agreements identified above and incorporated herein by reference (collectively, the \u201cAgreement\u201d), is executed in the English language.\nTo the extent any translation is provided to you, it is provided for convenience purposes only, and in the event of any conflict between the English and translated version, where permitted by law, the English version will control and prevail.\nWhere the translated version is required to be provided to you and is to be considered binding by law (i) both language versions shall have equal validity, (ii) each party acknowledges that it has reviewed both language versions and that they are substantially the same in all material respects, and (iii) in the event of any discrepancy between these two versions, the translated version may prevail, provided that the intent of the Parties has been fully taken into consideration.</p>\n<p>Products</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website Firewall</li>\n<li>Website Security Platform</li>\n<li>Website Backups</li>\n<li>WordPress Security</li>\n<li>Enterprise

may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we\u2019 d highlight and explain a bit more about what these might be(as they vary from time to time):</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cookies and similar technologies</b> on
