privileges on your mobile operating system.</p>Security<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\nHowever, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.\nTherefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>International Data Transfer<p>For users residing in the European Economic Area (EEA), please note that the personal data information we obtain from or about you may be transferred, processed and stored outside of the EEA for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including in the United States of

agreement in this Section (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) carefully.\nIt requires you to arbitrate disputes with SpanishDict and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.<ul>\n<li>16.1 <strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Website, to any products sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with SpanishDict, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify,.\nand (2) you or SpanishDict may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).\nThis Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</li>\n<li>16.2 <strong>Arbitration Rules and Forum.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\nTo begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent [include name and address of registered agent here].\nThe arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.\nDisputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys\u2019 fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS\u2019s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.\nall other claims shall be subject to JAMS\u2019s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.\nJAMS\u2019s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.\nIf JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.\nIf the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS\u2019s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, SpanishDict will pay them for you.\nIn addition, SpanishDict will reimburse all such JAMS\u2019s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</li>\n</ul>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<ul>\n<li>16.3 <strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and SpanishDict.\nThe arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum\u2019s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</li>\n<li>16.4 <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> YOU AND SPANISHDICT HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.\nYou and SpanishDict are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 17.1 above.\nAn arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.\nHowever, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</li>\n<li>16.5 <strong>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection\u2019s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of Virginia.\nAll other claims shall be arbitrated.</li>\n<li>16.6 <strong>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</strong> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: support@spanishdict.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\nYour notice must include your name and address, your SpanishDict username (if any), the email address you used to set up your SpanishDict account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.\nOpting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</li>\n<li>16.7 <strong>Severability.</strong> Except as provided in subsection 17.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</li>\n<li>16.8 <strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with SpanishDict.</li>\n<li>16.9 <strong>Modification.</strong> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if SpanishDict makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing SpanishDict at the following address: Curiosity Media, 1400 Key Blvd., Suite 1200, Arlington, VA 22209.</li>\n</ul>17.\nGeneral Provisions<ul>\n<li>17.1 <strong>Electronic Communications.</strong> The communications
