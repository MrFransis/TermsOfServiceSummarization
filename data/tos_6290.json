performance of services on our behalf, such as gathering and analyzing information and the provision of services to you.\nIn the course of performing these responsibilities and providing such services, these other companies may have access to your information.\nWe may also share information, including your information, with these Services Providers in order to enable them to perform these responsibilities and to provide these services.\nThese Services Providers may have adopted their own privacy policies, which are not subject to control by Anedot.\nYou should always review the policies of these Service Providers to make sure that you are comfortable with the ways in which they collect, use, maintain, protect and disclose your information.\nWe do not list our current Service Providers because they change from time to time.\nIf you would like the names of any of Service Providers, please email us at help@anedot.com.\nThe Service Providers may also transmit cookies to your computer or device when you click on ads that appear on or through the Service.\nAs a convenience to you, we may or may in the future also provide links to other third-parties from within our Service.\nIf you click on one of these links, you will be redirected to that third-party\u2019s site (via affiliate cookies) and such third party may also transmit cookies to you.\nWe do not have any control over that or how they collect, use, maintain, protect and disclose your information.\nPlease be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you are no longer using any of the Anedot Services, and those third parties may not honor \u201cDo Not Track\u201d requests you have set using your web browser.\nFacebook Pixel The Facebook pixel is an analytics tool that allows us to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements by understanding the actions visitors take on the Site.\nWe use pixel data to: \u2022 Make sure our advertisements are being shown to the right people<br>\n<br>\u2022 Build advertising audience<br>\n<br>\u2022 Unlock additional Facebook advertising tools<br>\n<br>\u2022 When someone visits the Site, and acts (like making a donation) the Facebook pixel is triggered and reports this action.\nThis way we will be able to reach out to that person again through future Facebook advertising.<br> More information about Facebook\u2019s privacy practices can be found at privacy.\nLinkedIn Insight Tags We use the \u201cLinkedIn Insight Tag\u201d on the Site.\nIt helps us with in-depth campaign reporting and insights about our website visitors.\nIt can also be used to track conversions, retarget website visitors, and unlock additional insights about members interacting with our ads on LinkedIn.\nThe LinkedIn Insight Tag enables the collection of data regarding members\u2019 visits to our website, including the URL, referrer, IP address, device and browser characteristics (User Agent), and timestamp.\nThis data is encrypted, the IP addresses are truncated, and members\u2019 direct identifiers are removed within seven days in order to make the data pseudonymous.\nThis remaining, pseudonymized data is then deleted within 90 days.\nLinkedIn does not share personal data with us, it only provides aggregated reports about the website audience and ad performance.\nLinkedIn also provides retargeting for website visitors, enabling us to show personalized ads off our website by using this data, but without identifying the member.\nLinkedIn members can control the use of their personal data for advertising purposes through their account settings.\nMore information about LinkedIn\u2019s privacy practices can be found at terms, privacy policy and cookie policies.\nHow We Use Your Information We will only use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information for purposes described in this
