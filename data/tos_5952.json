platform, and with tools for managing and distributing video, audio, written and other content over the Internet.\nPanopto has limited knowledge of Customer data within that platform, and only processes hosted data in accordance with the Customer\u2019s instructions.\nPanopto is a Processor of hosted data, including Customer Content.\nThe Customer is the Controller for that hosted data, including all their provided Content.</p>\n<p>Customers utilize our Services to distribute, display, process, and store video, audio, written, and other Content belonging to them or their respective Authorized Users.\nSuch content on the Customer\u2019s account may be viewable to various sized audiences depending upon the Customer-selected configuration of our Services.</p>\n<p>Our Customers are responsible for maintaining the privacy of Personal Data pertaining to their Authorized Users, in the Customer\u2019s capacity as the Controller of Personal Data uploaded to our Services.&nbsp.\nPanopto processes information under the direction of its Customers and may have no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Data it processes.\nAn individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to the Panopto Customer (the \u201cData Controller\u201d).</p>\n<p>Similarly, Panopto has no direct control over the data collected by its Customers.\nPanopto Customers choose the geographical regions for the storage of data for which they are the Controller, are directly responsible for the configuration and administration of their Panopto Services, and are responsible for adhering to legal and regulatory requirements, including the collection and maintenance of any necessary rights, permissions, and consents for the data which they collect and process as a Controller.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Panopto as a Data Controller</strong>\n<br>\nIn some circumstances, such as during the account registration process for use of Panopto Services, during billing procedures, and through your use of Panopto Services, Panopto collects and maintains Personal Data.\nThis data is collected and maintained solely for the offer and maintenance of Panopto Services for Customer use, and for the relevant communications and uses detailed within this policy.\nFor these purposes, Panopto is the Controller.</p>\n<p>The collection and processing of your Personal Data for direct use and administration of our Services is based on contractual obligation, necessary to provide you with access and use of the Services.\nPanopto also processes Personal Data where it has a legitimate interest to do so, where we have your consent, and where we are legally required.\nWe have outlined the details for the types of Personal Data processing Panopto engages in below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Collection of Personal Data</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Collected from You Directly</strong>\n<br>\nPanopto requires some of your Personal Data to effectively operate, while providing you the best experiences with our Services.\nSome of this data comes directly from you when you perform transactions with Panopto, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact us via our websites, phone, email, or Support team,</li>\n<li>Create a Panopto account, or have an Authorized User account created for you,</li>\n<li>Act as, or be designated as, an Authorized Support Contact on behalf of your organization or the primary Panopto Pro account holder,</li>\n<li>Administer your organization\u2019s or your Panopto Pro dashboard access,</li>\n<li>Login to or utilize the Services, including any upload/download of Content,</li>\n<li>Respond to marketing promotions that we offer,</li>\n<li>Inquire or apply for employment with Panopto.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This data may include name, username, title, mailing and billing addresses, organization or employer, phone number, email address, and/or information automatically collected, as detailed below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong>\n<br>\nAs is true of most websites, we also gather certain information automatically when you visit our websites, mobile application, or interact with our Services, including viewing, commenting on, or otherwise interacting with Content.\nThis information is used to analyze aggregated trends and to administer our Services, and may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, the type of device you use, operating system and version, device identifier, where the application was downloaded from, usage information, events that occur within the application, performance data, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.\nPlease see the&nbsp;<strong>Cookies and Similar Technology&nbsp;</strong>section below for more details.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you contact our customer support team, we may automatically collect or request this information to aid in troubleshooting and error reporting.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Received from Third Parties</strong>\n<br>\nAs detailed above, Panopto primarily acts as a Processor of the Personal Data provided to us by our Customers.\nWe may also receive information about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or from third parties.\nThis data helps us to update, expand, and analyze our records, identify new Customers, and identify Services that may be of interest to you.\nThis may include purchased marketing data about our Customers from third parties, that is combined with information we already have about you, to create more tailored advertising and Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile App</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you download and use our Services, we may automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version and the device identifier (or \u201cUDID\u201d).</p>\n<p>We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update the services, or to notify you about any events or promotions that we may be running.\nIf you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.</p>\n<p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your mobile device.\nThis software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Use of Personal Data</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>\n<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nThis section describes how Panopto uses the Personal Data that we collect to operate our business and to provide you our Services, including improvements to those Services and in the personalization of your experiences.\nWe may also use the data to communicate with you, providing account information, security updates and Service information.\nWe may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service.\nTransfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers.\nAdditionally, data is used to market our Services, to comply with applicable laws and legal processes, to enforce our terms and conditions, and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain.</p>\n<p>To provide a requested service or carry out a contract with you, we use Personal Data collected from you in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer Support:&nbsp;to diagnose and repair technical issues and provide other customer care and support services.</li>\n<li>Account Notifications:&nbsp;to communicate Service and account notifications to you.\nFor example, we may contact you by phone, email, or other means to inform you of account status, usage, and billing details, and to notify you when security updates are available.</li>\n<li>Security, Safety, and Dispute Resolution: to protect the security and safety of our Services and our Customers, to detect and prevent fraud, to resolve disputes, and to enforce our agreements.</li>\n<li>Providing the Services:&nbsp;to carry out transactions requested by you or the respective Customer, and to provide our Services, such as the account administration, viewing, and analytical tools provided within our platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where we have a legitimate interest, we may also use data collected from you in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service Personalization:&nbsp;to include personalized features and recommendations that enhance your productivity and user experience enjoyment, and automatically tailor your Service experiences based on the data we have about your activities, interests, and locations.</li>\n<li>Business Operations:&nbsp;to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions about, and report on the performance of our business.</li>\n<li>Service Improvement:&nbsp;to continually improve our Services, including adding new features or capabilities.\nFor example, we use error reports to improve performance features of our Services, and usage data to determine new features or Services to prioritize.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where we rely on legitimate interest for processing your information, we carry out a \u2018balancing test\u2019 to ensure that our processing is necessary and that your fundamental rights of privacy are not outweighed by our legitimate interests, before we go ahead with such processing.\nTo better understand how to control the Personal Data collected for these types of processing, please see the&nbsp;<strong>Cookies and Similar Technology</strong> section below.</p>\n<p>Where we have your consent, we may use data we collect to communicate with you in a variety of formats and to tailor those communications to you.</p>\n<p>Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>inviting you to participate in surveys,</li>\n<li>email subscriptions,</li>\n<li>promotional communications from Panopto by email, SMS, physical mail, or telephone,</li>\n<li>recruitment, employment and education verification, background checks and human resource matters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Automated decision making</strong>\n<br>\nPanopto employs automated decision making (also known as \u201cprofiling\u201d) in the processing of your data in very limited ways, and only in accordance with the specifications of this Policy and applicable laws.\nFor example, we may auto-assign customer support personnel to respond to your inquiries, based on your organization or affiliated Customer, and necessary details of that contract, or auto-assign a regional contact to assist you, based on your location.\nThese actions are necessary to provide you with our Services and related support.</p>\n<p>Similarly, some automated decision making is used, with your consent, to determine appropriate communications to you, as detailed above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Sharing of Personal Data</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This section describes how Panopto may share and disclose Personal Data.\nCustomers determine their own policies and practices for the sharing and disclosure of data, and Panopto does not control how they choose to share or disclose Information.</p>\n<p>Panopto, Inc.\nand its subsidiaries and affiliates are in different countries around the world and by accessing our Services, your information may be transferred outside of your local jurisdiction.\nFor additional information, see the <strong>International Data Transfers </strong>section of this Policy.</p>\n<p>Panopto may share your Personal Data with your consent, or as necessary to complete a transaction or provide a Service you or a Customer has requested or authorized.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may disclose generic, aggregated (pseudonymized) demographic information, not linked to any specific Data Subject, regarding Panopto visitors and users with a Customer owning the content you have interacted with, and to our business partners, trusted affiliates, and suppliers or agents working on our behalf.</li>\n<li>We may use third-party service providers to help us operate or administer the Services.\nFor example, companies we\u2019ve hired to provide customer service support or to assist in protecting and securing our services and systems may need access to Personal Data to complete those functions.\nIn such cases, these companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use Personal Data they receive from us for any other purpose.</li>\n<li>We may disclose Personal Data to a third-party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>\n<li>As we believe to be necessary or appropriate, we may disclose Personal Data: (a) under applicable laws, including laws outside your country of residence.\n(b) to comply with a subpoena or other legal process.\n(c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence.\n(d) to enforce our terms and conditions.\n(e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates.\n(f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others.\nand (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you elect to use connected third-party applications, your Personal Data may be shared with the companies who provide those applications.\nIn those cases, we encourage you to review and understand the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third parties, over whom we have no control.</p>\n<p>As an example, for Panopto Pro accounts, Panopto relies on a Partner to process associated payments.\nYour billing information is collected and processed by the Partner, at the direction of, and on behalf of Panopto.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Protection of Personal Data</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Panopto has adopted security measures to protect Personal Data against loss, theft, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.&nbsp.\nThese measures include policies, procedures, employee training, physical access control, and technical elements relating to data access controls.&nbsp.\nIn addition, Panopto uses industry-standard encryption to facilitate the exchange and transmission of data.&nbsp.\nPanopto only processes Personal Data in compliance with the purposes for which it has been collected, in accordance with this Policy.</p>\n<p>If Personal Data is acquired by an unauthorized person, and applicable law requires notification, we will promptly notify the affected Data Controller and where applicable and known to Panopto, we will also notify the affected Data Subject(s).&nbsp.\nNotice will be consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement, and any measures necessary for Panopto or law enforcement to determine the scope of the breach and to ensure or restore the integrity of a system.&nbsp.\nPanopto may delay notification if we, or a law enforcement agency, determine that the notification will impede a criminal investigation.\nIn such case, notification will not be provided unless and until we or the agency determines that notification will not compromise the investigation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Data Retention</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Panopto will only retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for us to use your information as described above and to comply with our legal obligations.\nPlease be advised that this means that we may retain some of your information after you cease to use our Services.\nFor instance, we may retain your Personal Data as necessary to meet our legal obligations, enforce an agreement, or for tax and accounting purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Your Rights as a Data Subject</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have several rights when it comes to your Personal Data.\nFurther information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country.</p>\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, you must contact the appropriate Controller, which may be a Panopto Customer.</p> Rights\nWhat does this mean? 1.&nbsp;The right to object to processing\nYou have the right to object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct

your information in accordance with data protection laws.\n4.\nThe right to rectification\nYou are entitled to have your information corrected if it\u2019s inaccurate or incomplete.\n5.\nThe right to erasure\nThis is also known as \u2018the right to be forgotten\u2019 and enables you to request the deletion or removal of your information where there\u2019s no compelling reason for the Controller or Processor to keep using it.\nThis is not a general and total right to erasure, and specific conditions apply.\n6.\nThe right to restrict processing\nYou have rights to \u2018block\u2019 or suppress further use of your information.\nWhen processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further.\nPanopto may continue to maintain a list of individuals for which processing is restricted, to ensure the request&nbsp;is respected in future.\n7.\nThe right to data portability\nYou have rights to obtain and reuse your Personal Data for your own purposes across different services.\nIf you request a copy of the Personal Data that Panopto is the Controller for, we will deliver it in .csv format or similar.\n8.\nThe right to lodge a complaint\nYou have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your Personal Data with your national data protection regulator.\n9.\nThe right to withdraw consent\nIf you have given your consent to anything we do with your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done with your Personal Data with your consent up to that point is unlawful).\nThis includes your right to withdraw consent to us using your Personal Data for marketing purposes.<p>\n</p>\n<p>To manage your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, visit the Profile section of your Panopto platform account.</p>\n<p>Panopto is a service provider and may not be the Controller of your Personal Data.\n&nbsp;If you wish to exercise any of your rights as detailed above, please first contact the appropriate Panopto Customer.\nYou can also contact Panopto directly, using the information listed in the <strong>Contacting Panopto</strong> section of this policy.\nIf Panopto is not the Controller responsible for responding to your request, we will forward the request to the appropriate Panopto Customer.\nWhere Panopto is the applicable Controller, we usually act on requests and provide information free of charge, but may charge a reasonable fee to cover our administrative costs of providing the information for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>baseless or excessive/repeated requests, or</li>\n<li>further copies of the same information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternatively, we may be entitled to refuse to act on the request.</p>\n<p>Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it.\nThese requests do not apply to mandatory service communications that are part of certain Panopto Services, nor to Personal Data controlled by Panopto\u2019s Customers.\nGenerally, Panopto will respond within 30 days from when we receive your request, unless the request will take substantially longer to fulfill.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Cookies &amp.\nSimilar Technologies</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Panopto and our partners may use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the
