and online services to post a privacy policy.\nThe law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.\n- See more at:<u> http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/</u>\n</p>\n<p>9.1.1.\nAccording to CalOPPA we agree

Protection Act (COPPA).\nWhen it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.\nWe do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>\n<p>9.3.\nThe Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.\nUnderstanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>\n<p>9.3.1.\nIn order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWe will notify a User via email within 7 business days;</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWe will notify a User via in site notification within 7 business days.</p>\n<p>9.3.2.\nWe also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.\nThis principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>\n<p>9.4.\nCAN SPAM Act.\nThe CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
