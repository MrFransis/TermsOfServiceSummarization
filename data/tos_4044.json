to such disputes and/or our Services.\nYou shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: \u201cA general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.\u201d </p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u> Will Patio ever change the Services? </u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> We\u2019re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time.\nWe may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.\nWe\u2019ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn\u2019t always practical.\nWe reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u> Do the Services cost anything? </u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> The Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future.\nWe will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u> What if I want to stop using the Services? </u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> You\u2019re free to do that at any time by contacting us at support@patio.app.\nplease refer

suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.\nPatio has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.\n</p>\n<p> Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.\nWe will try to provide advance notice to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone\u2019s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of Patio.\n</p>\n<p> If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at support@patio.app \u2013 we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can\u2019t promise that we can recover or restore anything.\n</p>\n<p> Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.\nBy way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u> What about Mobile Applications? </u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> You acknowledge and agree

relating to Apple App Store set forth below.\nYou agree to comply with, and your license to use our application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions.\nTo the

the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p> (b) <i> Costs of Arbitration.\n</i> The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nPatio will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.\nPatio will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.\n</p>\n<p> (c) <i> Small Claims Court.\nInfringement.\n</i> Either you or Patio may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Mateo County, California or any United States county where you live or work.\nFurthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.\n</p>\n<p> (d) <i> Waiver of Jury Trial.\n</i> YOU AND PATIO WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou and Patio are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn any litigation between you and Patio over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND PATIO WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n</p>\n<p>

BASIS.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Patio is entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.\n</p>\n<p> (f) <i> Opt-out.\n</i> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 555 Bryant St Suite 857, Palo Alto, CA 94301 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.\nYou must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.\n</p>\n<p> (g) <i> Exclusive Venue.\n</i> If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Patio to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Patio agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Mateo County, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.\n</p>\n<p> (h) <i> Severability.\n</i> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.\nThis arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Patio.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u> Miscellaneous.\n</u> You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Patio may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.\nThe failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nIf any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nYou and Patio agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Patio, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Patio, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Patio in any respect whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p> Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple
