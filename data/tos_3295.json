the \u201ctell-a-friend\u201d functionality for the sole purposes of sending this one-time email.</p> &nbsp.\nHow your Personal Data may be shared through online interactions <p>In addition to the types of disclosures of Personal Data described separately in this Privacy Notice, we may share Personal Data online for the additional purposes as described in this section.</p> &nbsp.\nThird-party advertising and online behavioral advertising <p>We may provide you with online advertisements for AbbVie products and services on third-party websites and mobile services that are tailored to you, which may be based on the Personal Data that you provide to us or to a third-party website that you are visiting, or on your browsing activity, purchases, or interests.\nWe may share some of your device information with our advertising service providers that we have obtained from cookies and other data-collection and tracking technologies based on your AbbVie Relationships.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Some AbbVie Relationships participate in online behavioral advertising (this is also sometimes called targeted advertising or interest-based advertising).\nYou can identify these sites by the \u201cAdvertising Choices\u201d link in the advertisement.&nbsp.\nOur advertising network partners may place and use cookies on our websites and on other third-party sites to collect Personal Data about your activities in order to provide you with online advertisements that are based on your interests.\nWhen an AbbVie online behavioral advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an \u201cAd Choices\u201d icon.\nClicking on the icon or link will take you to a website where you can manage or opt-out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioral advertisements.\nIf you opt-out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from AbbVie that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed rather than your prior clickstream activity).\nIn some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behavior.\nYou can also opt-out now by clicking&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>You may also opt out of certain online behavioral advertising on the&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance's consumer choice tool, and the&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s tool.</p>\n<p>Some web browsers may transmit \u201cdo-not-track\u201d signals to web services with which your browser communicates.\nAs of the effective date of this Privacy Notice, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals.\ntherefore, AbbVie does not currently respond to these signals.\nHowever, you can opt-out from advertisers that use your browsing history to deliver online behavioral advertisements via the mechanisms listed above.</p> &nbsp.\nLinks to third-party sites and social media plug-ins <p>This Privacy Notice only applies to AbbVie Relationships linked to this Privacy Notice and does not apply to third-party websites to which AbbVie Relationships may link, including links to outside websites or advertisements from third parties.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy statements provided by all third parties prior to providing them with Personal Data.</p>\n<p>AbbVie Relationships may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook \u201cLike\u201d button and the \u201cShare to Twitter\u201d button) to enable you to easily share information with others.&nbsp;When you visit our sites as part of an AbbVie Relationship, the operator of the social plug-in and integrated social media platforms can place a cookie on your device that enables that operator to receive your Personal Data that allow the operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our sites.&nbsp.\nIf you are logged into the social media site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our site, the social media plug-in allows that social media site to receive information that you have visited our site.\nThe social media plug-in also allows the social media site to share information about your activities on our site with other users of that social media site.\nThese sharing&nbsp;settings are managed by the social media site, and you should refer to those sites\u2019 privacy policies for information about their privacy and data-sharing practices.</p>\n<p> [Top]<br>\n</p> &nbsp.\nAdditional information for California residents <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights with respect to AbbVie\u2019s use and disclosure of your Personal Data.\nThose California-specific

categories and specific pieces of Personal Data either from your or from other third parties.\nWe collect, use, and disclose Personal Data for our business and commercial purposes described in this

providers and health plans, subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d).\nThe health data received by AbbVie was deidentified based on either HIPAA\u2019s \u201csafe harbor\u201d method, which means that certain direct identifiers were removed from the health data, or HIPAA\u2019s expert determination method, which means that a qualified statistician reviewed the health data shared with AbbVie and confirmed that there is a very small risk that an individual could be identified from the remaining health data.</p>\n<p>As a California resident, you have the right to request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information about the Personal Data that AbbVie has collected, used, and disclosed about you over the previous 12 months.\nThis

providing you with a different level or quality of products, based solely upon this request.\nHowever, certain AbbVie Relationships may require your consent to have your Personal Data shared with AbbVie to provide the service or to allow us to use and disclose your Personal Data to provide the AbbVie Relationships.\nWhen you exercise your deletion right, you may lose access to certain aspects of AbbVie Relationships that require your Personal Data to perform the service.</p>\n<p>Please see the&nbsp;Your privacy rights and choices&nbsp.\nsection if you or your authorized representative have questions or would like to make a request to exercise any of your rights described in this section.\nAfter you make your request, we will use the information we have to verify your identify (and if applicable, your authorized agent\u2019s identify), and to match the Personal Data we have collected about you, if any, to your verified identify.&nbsp.\nOur verification process may include a request for additional information to confirm your identify or your authorized agent\u2019s identify, or to obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf.\nIf our verification process is successful, we will respond to your request within the time and in the manner required by applicable law.\nIf we cannot validate the identify of you and/or your authorized agent or obtain proof that you have given your authorized agent permission to act on your behalf, we will attempt to contact you to inform you.</p>\n<p> [Top]<br>\n</p> &nbsp.\nAdditional information
