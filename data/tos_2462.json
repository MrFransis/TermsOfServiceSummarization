purchase.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>7.\nMERCHANDISE</strong>\n<p>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nMerchandise.&nbsp.\nWe may offer merchandise, physical or digital goods or services (collectively, \u201c<strong>Merchandise</strong>\u201d) for sale on the Website.\n&nbsp;The price for Merchandise shall be displayed at the point of purchase.&nbsp.\nYou shall be responsible for the payment of any Merchandise purchased by you, as well as any shipping costs, taxes or other fees associated with Merchandise.&nbsp.\nWe reserve the right, with or without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue any Merchandise sold or offered for sale.</p>\n<p>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nCurrency.&nbsp.\nAll charges and payments for Merchandise will be made in U.S.\nDollars unless otherwise specified.&nbsp.\nCurrency exchange settlements and foreign transaction fees are based on your agreement with your
