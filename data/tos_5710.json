REGULATORY REPORTING<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to ensure the safety of medical devices, regulators place a legal obligation on manufacturers to report certain complaints and potential adverse events to them.\nLifeScan may share this information with other LifeScan companies in other countries, its service providers or business partners who assist in the maintenance and operation of LifeScan\u2019s complaints database.</p>\n<p>In some cases, LifeScan may not be the legal manufacturer of devices that we promote or make available, in those circumstances, we are obliged to pass on details of complaints and potential adverse events to the device\u2019s legal manufacturer so that they may report the matter to applicable regional or national regulatory bodies, including those that may have different data protection laws than the laws that apply in your country.</p>\n<p>Where relevant, LifeScan enters into European Union standard contractual clauses (or equivalent measures) with the party outside the European Economic Area receiving the personal data.\nA copy of the relevant standard contractual clauses is available upon request.</p>\n<p>LifeScan processes complaint and adverse event data in order to comply with legal requirements to which it or its business partners are subject.\nWhere LifeScan processes health data (which is a special category of data) for these purposes, LifeScan does so for reasons of public interest in ensuring high standards of quality and safety of medical devices.\nAny data provided for complaint and/or adverse event reporting purposes will not be used for direct marketing.</p>\n<p>If you are a healthcare professional, LifeScan may be required, by law or industry codes of practice, to report on or to make public disclosures of

location and the nature and amount of the transfer of value or payment.</p> LINKS TO OTHER SITES<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When we provide a link to another website or application that is not owned or controlled by LifeScan, we are not responsible for how such websites or applications handle your Personal Data.\nWe urge you to read the linked website\u2019s privacy policy.\nThe inclusion of a link to a third-party website or application does not mean that LifeScan endorses that website or application.</p> TRANSFERS TO OTHER COUNTRIES<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a global company, we have operations and service providers that may not be located in your country.\nBy using any of our Services or, where required by law, by providing us with your consent, your information may be processed and / or stored outside of your country of residence.\nData protection laws in those countries may differ from the laws in your country.\nAppropriate contractual and other measures are in place to protect Personal Data when it is transferred to LifeScan company or third parties in other countries.</p>\n<p>For residents of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d): Some countries outside the EEA are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection (the full list of these countries is available here(link is external)).\nFor transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we shall ensure that adequate measures are in place, including by ensuring that the recipient is bound by the European Union\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses or by another method which has been approved by the European Commission.</p>\n<p>If you are using the Services in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, you specifically acknowledge and
