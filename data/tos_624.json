"//div[@class='cms-page-content privacypolicy container']", "text": "EPIC GAMES PRIVACY POLICY <p>Last updated on March 31st, 2020</p>\n<p>The Epic Games Privacy Policy is designed to help you better understand the information we collect and the different ways we may use or share it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This policy applies to your use of the Epic services.\nBy \u201cEpic services,\u201d we mean any of our websites, stores, games, game developer tools, applications, or other products or services that link to this policy.\nAdditional terms and conditions may also apply to your relationship with Epic, depending on how you choose to interact with us.\nPlease read this entire policy to make sure you fully understand it.\nYou should also be sure to carefully review other terms potentially applicable to your visit and your use of specific Epic services (such as Fortnite or the use of your Epic Account with third-party games), and confirm that you understand and agree to them, before using the Epic services.</p>\n<p>Epic Games, Inc.\nand our subsidiaries operate and support the Epic services from different locations around the world.\nWhen we say \u201cEpic\u201d or \u201cEpic Games,\u201d we\u2019re referring to the relevant Epic entity identified for your region in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section of the policy below.\nThis Epic entity is responsible for providing the Epic services to you and is the controller of information collected under this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please see \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d below to learn more about sending us any privacy-related questions or concerns you may have.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Information We Collect <p>We generally collect information in three ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by creating an account, making purchases, or signing up for email alerts, (2) we collect information automatically from your use of the Epic services, such as through cookies or our games and other software, and (3) other parties, such as game console platforms and social networks, may provide information to us.\nEach of these methods is described in more detail below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> (1) Information You Provide <p>You may provide your personal information to us when you choose to use the Epic services.\nBecause we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with information also may change.\nSome of the most common examples of situations in which you may provide information to us include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating an Epic account;</li>\n<li>Licensing and downloading our games or game engines;</li>\n<li>Using the Epic services\u2019 social features (see \u201cWhen You Use Social Features of the Epic Services\u201d);</li>\n<li>Purchasing something from us or otherwise engaging in a transaction with us;</li>\n<li>Entering online competitions or registering for or participating in special events;</li>\n<li>Entering contests or sweepstakes, participating in any of our promotions, or accepting any prizes from us;</li>\n<li>Signing up for email alerts or subscribing to receive other information from us;</li>\n<li>Completing a survey;</li>\n<li>Using a mobile device, such as a phone, to play our games or use our applications.\nand</li>\n<li>Contacting us for any reason, such as by email, including for technical support or customer service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The specific types of information you may be able to provide us will often vary depending on the Epic services you are using and how you interact with them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you\u2019ll need an Epic account to access certain parts of the Epic services.\nIf you\u2019d like to create one, you may be asked to provide basic registration details like your name, a public-facing display name, password, country of residence, and email address.\nWe automatically assign each new Epic account with a number (an \u201cEpic account ID\u201d) during the registration process, which helps to uniquely reference your Epic account across the Epic services and facilitate features like cross-play.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to make a purchase, we may ask you to provide billing information (like your card\u2019s payment account number and expiration date) to enable the transaction.\nSometimes we ask for other information like your phone number, postal address, billing address, and date of birth.\nWe\u2019ll also collect information when you choose to share it with us directly in any other way, including by sending it as part of a communication with Epic (like through Player Support requests) or other users of the Epic services (like through in-game chat or forum posts).</p>\n<p>Some of our websites also provide a feature that supports job applications, in which case we also ask for your resume, real name, email address, and phone number.\nWe use this information to determine if you are qualified for the position for which you applied or to contact you to set up an interview.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> (2) Information We Collect Automatically <p>We collect some information automatically when you visit the Epic services.\nWe typically aggregate this data and use it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals.&nbsp.\nIf a combination of information that we collect does identify you as an individual, we will treat the combined information as personal information.</p>\n<p>We collect information automatically through technologies such as web browsers, cookies, log files, web beacons, and our back-end servers collect usage data transmitted from the Epic services.\nWe use the information for purposes such as modifying or improving features, managing advertising, addressing technical issues, preventing fraud or misuse of our services, and conducting data analytics.\nThe type of information that we automatically collect may vary, but generally includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access the Internet or our services, such as IP address or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system related specifications);</li>\n<li>Usage information and statistics about your interaction with the Epic services, which may include the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, and other usage statistics;</li>\n<li>Crash reports, which may be automatically generated when a game or application crashes and includes information about your system and the crash;</li>\n<li>Information that facilitates a safer and more personalized experience, such as your display name or other user identification provided in connection with your application use or game play, saved preferences, game progress, and device identifiers or usage information for authentication and fraud prevention purposes.\nand</li>\n<li>The location of your device, such as may be derived from your device\u2019s IP address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that if certain features on the Epic services are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of the Epic services or others\u2019 websites over time.\nThese features are subject to those third parties\u2019 privacy notices and policies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fraud Prevention &amp.\nAnti-Cheat</em>:</p>\n<p>Providing users with a fair, balanced, and competitive experience on the Epic services is extremely important to us.\nWe strictly enforce prohibitions against cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the Epic services.\nWhen you create an Epic account, buy our products or services, play our games, or otherwise interact with the Epic on or through the Epic services, we may use a variety of anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies to help us identify and prevent malicious activity.\nThese services may collect and analyze data about the game binary or your computer to detect cheating, and may be provided by Epic or by third parties such as BattleEye.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> (3) Information We Receive from Others <p>In some cases, other parties provide us with information about you, or allow us to collect information about you.\nWe generally collect information from other parties in four ways: (1) you interact with Epic using a service that is not controlled by us, such as a social network, (2) you choose to use a social feature of the Epic services, (3) you access Epic services through another party, such as a gaming console or mobile device operator, or (4) you link a third party account to your Epic account.\nIn some cases, we are not able to control the amount or type of information that other parties, like social networks, make available to us.\nIn those cases, we use only the data that we need to provide the types of services we think our users want and expect.\nAlthough we cannot control your privacy settings at those websites or how those other parties protect your privacy, once we receive information about you through those websites, we will treat it in accordance with this policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>When You Interact with Epic on Third Party Services</em>\n</p>\n<p>When you interact with Epic on a website or app not controlled by Epic, that website or app may allow Epic access to certain information about you.\nFor example, social networks may provide us with information from your profile on their services or other information that you agreed the social network or other party could provide to us.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>When You Use Social Features of the Epic Services</em>\n</p>\n<p>When you choose to use some of the Epic services\u2019 social features, you allow Epic to receive information about you from third parties (like social networks).\nOur social features promote and facilitate interaction among players, such as by allowing you and your friends to work together to meet a shared challenge presented by our game or application.\nYou may be able to use these features to find out if your friends are actively playing the game and using the feature, to find out if they used it in the past, and to invite them to join with you to meet a game challenge.</p>\n<p>If you choose to use one of our social features, you may be asked to log into a social network through our game or application.\nThe social network may then provide Epic with information such as your social network user ID, your profile picture, and the user IDs and profile pictures of your connections.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>When You Access Epic Services through Other Parties or Devices</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may also receive information about you from the organizations that sell our games or applications, or which provided the gaming system you use.\nThose parties may provide us with information regarding your account or registration, but they do not give us your payment information.\nBecause those organizations determine what information they will collect from you, it may vary according to their services, but is likely to include details such as your display name and user ID for those services, as well as device and region information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>When You Link a Third Party Account to Your Epic Account</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to link a third party account, such as a gaming console or social media account, to your Epic account, the third party will provide Epic with information about that account.\nBecause those organizations determine what information they will collect from you, it may vary according to their services, but is likely to include details such as your third party account display name and user ID, as well as associated device information, name, and email address.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> How We Use and Share Information <p>As a general matter, we use and share the information we collect (either individually or in combination with other information collected as described in this policy) to help us provide, improve, customize, analyze, and market the Epic services where we have an appropriate basis to do so.</p> (1) Use <p>We rely on several different legal bases to process personal information for the purposes disclosed in this policy.\nThese often depend on the exact nature of your relationship with Epic, but common examples include:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To support our legitimate interests, such as:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>To communicate with you, respond to your requests, or provide you with updates and information;</li>\n<li>To better understand our users and their preferences;</li>\n<li>To personalize your experience, save your preferences, authenticate our users, and provide similar user-experience features;</li>\n<li>To develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and other offerings, some of which may be offered in partnership with other parties;</li>\n<li>To manage and customize advertisements or promotional offers;</li>\n<li>For security purposes.\nand</li>\n<li>For internal purposes such as auditing and data analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide services that are subject to terms you have accepted, such as enforcing our licenses, agreements, and terms of service, which may include reasonable monitoring to detect and prevent misuse or fraud, keep our games fair for all users, and otherwise protect and defend the Epic services.</li>\n<li>When you give consent, which you can withdraw at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We store personal information for as long as we reasonably need it to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.\nFor example, if you create an Epic account, we will store the personal information associated with your Epic account for as long as needed to maintain your account, provide the Epic services you requested, enforce any applicable terms that govern your use of the Epic services, and maintain appropriate records to reflect our delivery of the Epic services to you.\nWe periodically review the personal information we retain to determine whether continued storage is proper.&nbsp;</p> (2) Sharing <p>\n<em>Service Providers.</em> We share personal information with service providers that we\u2019ve engaged to help support the Epic services by performing certain services on our behalf and under our instructions.\nFor example, if you make a purchase on the Epic services, we\u2019ll generally share your billing information with a third-party payment processor to enable your transaction.\nOther common examples include partners that assist with cloud storage, email marketing of products and services offered by Epic, Player Support ticketing, and monitoring and securing the Epic services.\nThese service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose personal information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Affiliates</em>.\nWe may share personal information we collect with Epic Games, Inc.\nsubsidiaries to support the Epic services worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>Marketing Partners.\n</em>We may share certain limited information, such as device identifiers, with marketing partners for purposes of executing and optimizing campaigns, and gauging the effectiveness of advertising and other marketing strategies solely on Epic's behalf.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Epic Games Store Partners</em>.\nIf you purchase a game from the Epic Games Store, we may share certain information associated with your Epic account with the game\u2019s developer or publisher to support your gameplay and permit them to contact you for appropriate purposes.\nFor example, to support gameplay we may share your Epic account ID and entitlement to the game.\nTo support in-game social features we may also share your Epic display name and your Epic friends list.\nYou may also opt-in to share your contact information with a game\u2019s developer or publisher.</p>\n<p>If a store partner removes their game from the Epic Games Store, we also will transfer information necessary to support your continued gameplay on another platform to them.\nWhen Epic provides your information to these independent developers and publishers, their use and disclosure of the information is governed by limitations in our agreements with them.\nHowever, they also provide their end users with privacy notices or policies that govern their use of your information.\nPersonal information you share with them or that is not provided by Epic will be subject to the developers\u2019 and publishers\u2019 privacy notices and policies, and may not be subject to this policy.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Epic Account Services.</em> If you sign in to a third-party developer\u2019s game or application using your Epic account, you may choose to share details about your Epic account such as your Epic account ID, Epic display name, linked account identifiers, online presence, and your Epic friends using the same game or application.\nThese third-party developers\u2019 uses of this Epic account information is governed by limitations in our agreements with them.\nPersonal information you share with them or which is not provided by Epic is subject to the third-party developers\u2019 privacy notices and policies, which may differ from Epic\u2019s practices as described in this policy.\nPlease review third-party developers\u2019 privacy policies carefully, and ensure you understand and are comfortable with how they handle your information, before using your Epic account to access their products or services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Social Features.</em> We may share, or provide you with opportunities to share, information about you with other users of the Epic services as described in this policy.\nWe also provide services that allow our users to communicate with Epic and each other, in which case personal information may be shared and account IDs may be displayed.\nFor example, we may share information about you with your social contacts when you and they use the same social features of our games and applications.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, or a reasonable request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (ii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, or (iii) if necessary to protect the vital interests of another individual (such as to prevent death, bodily harm, or serious damage to property).\nWe reserve the right to transfer information about our users in the event we sell or transfer all or substantially all our business or assets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Your Choices and Controls <p>We seek to provide you with meaningful choices about the personal information you share with Epic, as well as the ways we may use or share that information.We\u2019ll generally only ask you for personal information that is necessary to provide the Epic services you request.\nYou can choose not to give us personal information we request, but if you decide not to, you may not be able to access certain parts of the Epic services and some features may not work as intended.</p>\n<p>We may also seek your prior consent to process your information in certain ways.\nYou aren\u2019t required to provide consent if you do not want your personal information to be processed for the requested purposes, and may withdraw your consent at any time.\nAny withdrawal of consent is only effective on a going-forward basis and will not impact processing we undertook while relying on your consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We provide you with the ability to request access to, and correction or deletion of, your personal information.\nYou can update your account information or request that we delete your Epic account directly through the Epic services at any time.\nIf you would like to request access to personal information associated with your Epic account, please see the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other examples of your choices include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can browse our website without providing any personal information.\nWe may collect some limited information automatically, as described above.</li>\n<li>You may opt out of receiving our marketing messages at any time by using the opt-out mechanism provided in the message.</li>\n<li>You can change your privacy settings on other parties\u2019 websites, such as social networks, which will stop or limit our receipt of information from those other websites.\nYou also may choose not to use social features we make available.\nIf you choose to use these features, you should refrain from posting personal information that will be visible to others, such as including your email address in a forum or during a chat.</li>\n<li>You may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies.\nNot all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser \u201cdo not track\u201d signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies.\nIn some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause our websites, games, and applications not to work as intended and some features may not be available.</li>\n<li>You can limit interest-based advertising by opting out at www.aboutads.info/choices/ or www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.\nIf you are located in Europe, more information is available at www.youronlinechoices.eu/.</li>\n<li>If you are under the age of 18 and have an account for our websites, mobile apps, game engines, games, or other online services, you may request that we remove certain content that you provided, such as deleting or editing comments you have posted.\nYou also may ask us to assist you in removing or anonymizing content you have posted by contacting us as described in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section of this policy.\nPlease be aware that taking these steps may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted on our websites, online services, applications, or games.\nWe also may not be able to remove content you post if applicable law requires us to maintain the posting or if another party has re-posted the content to a website, app, game or other online service that we do not own or control.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also exercise and amend your choices by sending an email to us as detailed in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>\n<em>EEA and UK Residents.\n</em>If you are an EEA or UK resident, you may have the right to access your information, the right to correct your information, the right to request deletion of your personal information, the right to request restricted processing of your personal information, the right to a portable copy of the personal information you have provided, and the right to object to processing of your personal information, such as for direct marketing.\nFor more information about exercising these rights, send an email to the address specified in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>EEA and UK residents may contact Epic\u2019s data protection officer with any questions or concerns about our handling of personal information at dpo@epicgames.com.\nEEA and UK residents also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority if they have concerns about Epic\u2019s handling of personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<em>California Residents.\n</em>If you are a California resident and are not a job applicant, employee or employee of another company interacting with us in your job, you have the right to ask us what personal information we have collected and shared about you, the right to request deletion of your personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights.\nFor more information about exercising these rights, send an email to the address specified in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sales of Information.\n</em>Epic only uses the personal information we collect to help provide, support, and improve the Epic services as described in this policy, and we do not sell this information to third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> How We Protect Information <p>We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use and other unlawful forms of processing.\nIn some cases, your information is accessible when you log into a feature we offer, and in those cases you need to keep your user credentials and password confidential and secure so that your information is protected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Children\u2019s Privacy <p>The Epic services are intended to be appropriate for general audiences and are not directed to children (usually considered to be under 13, depending on where you reside).\nEpic does not intentionally collect personal information from children without seeking any required parental approval in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, such as the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d).</p>\n<p>We may ask you to provide age-related information in order to help us comply with laws like COPPA.\nFor example, we may request your date of birth to determine whether COPPA requires us to obtain verifiable parental consent from your parent or guardian before allowing you to access the Epic services.</p>\n<p>If a user indicates they are a COPPA minor, we\u2019ll require that user to complete a parental approval process before continuing to access the relevant Epic services.\nThis process is designed to notify parents that their child has requested access to the Epic services, inform them about Epic\u2019s privacy practices, offer them the opportunity to approve Epic\u2019s collection and use of their child\u2019s information as described in this policy, and describe the controls that we make available to them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once a parent provides their consent, we\u2019ll give them an opportunity to review and change important account settings that control how their child can interact with the Epic services.\nTo learn more, see https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/parental-controls.\nParents are also generally free to change or revoke the choices they\u2019ve previously made, and can review the personal information associated with their child\u2019s account or request that we delete it from our systems.\nTo submit these requests or ask us any other questions you may have about how we handle your child\u2019s personal information, please see \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d below.</p>\n<p>Authorized child accounts are otherwise treated much like other Epic accounts.\nThey can generally play approved games (such as Fortnite), access communications and social features (like chat and friends lists), and freely interact with most of the Epic services (including downloading other games from the Epic Games Store).\nFor additional details, please see the \u201cInformation We Collect\u201d and \u201cHow We Use and Share Information\u201d sections of the policy above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Transfers of Information <p>Epic Games is a company with operations around the world.\nBy using the Epic services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be processed outside your country of residence, including in other jurisdictions (like the United States) that may have different data protection frameworks than your region.\nTo learn more about the Epic entity responsible for operating the Epic services in your region, see \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d below.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve implemented and maintain a framework consistent with applicable law and this policy for transfers of information outside the country of collection.\nFor example, when we transfer personal data collected in the European Union to locations outside the European Economic Area, we rely on transfer mechanisms adopted by the European Commission to help establish adequate safeguards, like Standard Contractual Clauses.\nWe may also need to transfer your information to provide the Epic services to you in accordance with our existing agreements with you, such as the Terms of Service.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Updates to Our Privacy Policy <p>This policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our personal information practices or relevant laws.\nWe will indicate at the top of this policy when this policy was last updated.\nPlease review this policy every time you access or use the Epic services to make sure that you have reviewed the most recent version.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> How to Contact Us <p>If you have general questions or concerns about the Epic services (such as game-related issues, trouble accessing your Epic account, bugs or other technical problems, payment matters, or content and entitlement issues), please contact our Player Support team.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Epic\u2019s privacy practices or this policy, please email your questions to privacy@epicgames.com or send

YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.<br>\nMost issues can be resolved quickly and amicably by contacting Epic customer support at https://www.epicgames.com/customer-service.\nBut we understand that sometimes disputes can\u2019t be easily resolved by customer support.\nThis Section explains how You and Epic agree to resolve those disputes, including (where applicable) by binding, individual arbitration.<br>\nArbitration is an alternative dispute-resolution procedure that allows us to resolve issues without the formality of going to court.\nAny dispute between You and Epic is submitted to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) for fair and fast resolution.\nArbitration is more efficient for both you and Epic.<br>\n<strong>Disputes related to Epic\u2019s End User License Agreement (\u201cEULA\u201d):</strong> If you have agreed to Epic\u2019s End User License Agreement (\u201cEULA\u201d), \u201cDisputes\u201d as that term is defined in the EULA will be resolved as provided for in the EULA, including the EULA\u2019s \u201cBinding Individual Arbitration\u201d section.&nbsp.\nThe dispute resolution terms below apply to disputes arising solely under these Terms and not to products or services governed by a EULA.<br>\n<strong>Disputes related to these Terms:</strong> If you have an issue related to these Terms and have not agreed to Epic\u2019s EULA, the dispute-resolution terms below apply.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.&nbsp.\nInformal Resolution:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you have an issue that our customer support can\u2019t resolve, prior to starting arbitration You and Epic agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally to help get us to a resolution and control costs for both parties.\nYou and Epic agree to make a good-faith effort to negotiate any dispute between us for at least 30 days (\u201cInformal Resolution\u201d).\nThose informal negotiations will start on the day You or Epic receive a written Notice of a Dispute in accordance with these Terms.<br>\nYou will send your Notice of Dispute to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: NOTICE OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A.\nInclude your name, any relevant account name you use, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want Epic to do.\nIf Epic has a dispute with You, Epic will send our Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.<br>\nIf you reside in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), You may also be entitled to submit Your complaint to the European Commission\u2019s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform.\nODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court.<br>\nIf the dispute isn\u2019t resolved within by Informal Resolution or small-claims court (below), You or Epic may start an arbitration in accordance with these Terms.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>2.&nbsp.\nSmall Claims Court:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nInstead of using Informal Resolution, You and Epic agree that You may sue us in small-claims court in your choice of the county where you live or Wake County, North Carolina (if you meet the requirements of small-claims court).\nWe hope you\u2019ll try Informal Resolution first, but you don\u2019t have to before going to small-claims court.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.\nBinding Individual Arbitration:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nTHE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS IN THIS SECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.<br>\nYou and Epic agree that Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration&nbsp;conducted by the Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc.\n(\u201cJAMS\u201d) subject to the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) as modified by these Terms.<br>\nThis means that You and Epic agree to a dispute-resolution process where we submit any Dispute to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) that makes the final decision to resolve the Dispute.&nbsp.\nJAMS uses experienced professionals to arbitrate disputes, which helps You and Epic resolve any disputes fairly, but more quickly and efficiently than going to court.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator may award the same remedies to you individually as a court could, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.<br>\n&nbsp;The arbitrator\u2019s decision is final, except for a limited review by courts under the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act, and can enforced like any other court order or judgment.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.1 Disputes We Agree to Arbitrate: </strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou and Epic agree to submit all Disputes between You and Epic to individual binding arbitration.\n\u201cDispute\u201d means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between You and Epic that relates to your use or attempted use of Epic\u2019s products or services and Epic\u2019s products and services generally, including without limitation the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Binding Individual Arbitration section.<br>\nYou and Epic agree to arbitrate all Disputes regardless of whether the Dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.<br>\nThe Informal Resolution and Arbitration sections do not apply to (1) individual actions in small-claims court.\n(2) pursuit of enforcement actions through a government agency if the law allows.\n(3) a complaint or remedy under the EU&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation.\n(4) an action to compel or uphold any prior arbitration decision.\n(5) Epic\u2019s right to seek injunctive relief against You in a court of law to preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds.\n(6) claims of piracy, creation, distribution, or promotion of Cheats, and intellectual-property infringement, and (7) the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below.&nbsp;<br>\nYou and Epic agree that whether a dispute is subject to arbitration under these Terms will be determined by the arbitrator rather than a court.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.2 Arbitration Procedure: </strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo start an arbitration, review the JAMS Rules and follow the instructions for initiating an arbitration on the JAMS website.\nThe party starting an arbitration must send JAMS a \u201cDemand for Arbitration\u201d (available on its website), pay a filing fee, and mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party.\nYou will send a copy to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A.\nEpic will send our copy to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.<br>\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single JAMS arbitrator selected with substantial experience in resolving intellectual-property and commercial-contract disputes.\nYou and Epic both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.<br>\nIf an in-person hearing is required, the hearing will take place either in Wake County, North Carolina, or where You reside.\nyou choose.<br>\nThe arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute.\nUnless You and Epic agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator\u2019s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.&nbsp;<br>\nThe arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by You or Epic to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence).&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator may not award relief against Epic respecting any person other than You.<br>\nAny decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.3 Arbitration Fees and Location:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf You start the arbitration, you must pay the JAMS filing fee required for consumer arbitrations.<br>\nIn some situations, Epic will help with your fees to (hopefully) get us to a resolution quickly and fairly:<br>\nIf the Dispute involves $10,000 or less, Epic will pay all of the JAMS costs, including the fees you otherwise would have been required to pay.<br>\nIf the above doesn\u2019t apply to You, but You demonstrate that arbitration costs will be prohibitive compared to litigation costs, Epic will pay as much of your JAMS costs as the arbitrator finds is necessary to prevent arbitration from being cost-prohibitive (as compared to the cost of litigation).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\nEven if Epic wins the arbitration and the applicable law or the JAMS Rules allow Epic to seek our portion of the JAMS fees from you, we won\u2019t.<br>\nThe fee assistance offered above is contingent upon You bringing the arbitration claim in \u201cgood faith\u201d.\nIf the arbitrator finds You brought an arbitration claim against Epic for an improper purpose, frivolously, or without a sufficient pre-claim investigation into the facts or applicable law, then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS rules.&nbsp;<br>\nJAMS costs do not include your Attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and Attorneys\u2019 fees and JAMS costs are not counted when determining how much a dispute involves.<br>\nEpic won\u2019t seek our attorneys\u2019 fees or expenses from you in any arbitration, even if the law or the JAMS rules entitle us to do so.\nIf you choose to be represented by an attorney, you will pay your own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs unless the applicable law provides otherwise.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.4 Notice and Filing:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf a Dispute must be arbitrated, You or Epic must start arbitration of the Dispute within two (2) years from when the Dispute first arose.&nbsp.\nIf applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two years after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period.&nbsp.\nEpic encourages You to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it.\nThe failure to provide timely notice shall bar all claims.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.5 Continuation in Effect:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis Binding Individual Arbitration section survives any termination of these Terms or Epic\u2019s provision of services to You.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.6 Future Terms Changes:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlthough Epic may revise these Terms in its discretion, Epic does not have the right to alter these Terms to arbitrate or the rules specified herein with respect to any Dispute once that Dispute arises.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>4.\nClass Action Waiver:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You and Epic agree to only bring Disputes in an individual capacity and shall not:<br>\nseek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions).\nor<br>\nconsolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit an arbitrator to do so without the express consent of all parties to these Terms and all other actions or arbitrations.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>5.\nSeverability:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf all or any provision of this Binding Individual Arbitration agreement is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then You and Epic agree that the provision will be severed and the rest of these Terms shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included.&nbsp.\nThe sole exception is that if the Class Action Waiver is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, You and Epic agree that it will not be severable.\nthis entire Binding Individual Arbitration section will be void and unenforceable and any dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of clauses specified in these Terms.&nbsp.\nUnder no circumstances shall arbitration be conducted on a class basis without Epic\u2019s express consent.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<u>Language</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, the controlling language for these Terms is English.\nIt is the express wish of the parties that these Terms and all related documents have been drawn up in English.\nLes parties d\u00e9clarent qu'elles ont demand\u00e9 et par les pr\u00e9sentes confirment leur desir expr\u00e9s que cette convention soit r\u00e9digee en anglais.\nAny translation has been provided for your convenience.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<u>\n<strong>Waiver and Severability</strong>\n</u>\n<br>\n<br>\nNo waiver of these Terms by Epic shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition, and any failure of Epic to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<br>\n<br>\nIf any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<u>\n<strong>Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of

create artwork, websites, and other stuff based on our intellectual property.\nAt the same time, we spend a lot of time, thought, and money creating our intellectual property and need to protect it.<br>\n<br>\nIn most cases, using our games, artwork, videos, music, characters, logos, and other intellectual property (\u201cEpic IP\u201d) without our permission is illegal and a violation of our rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;So we created this Policy to explain what you may do regarding your Fan Content.\nIn this Policy, \u201cFan Content\u201d means: (i) your fan art (such as artwork, photographs, videos, and other materials) that is based on the Epic IP.\nand (ii) your Epic IP-related personal, non-commercial websites and apps that are freely accessible to the public.<br>\n<br>\nPlease read this Policy carefully before creating any Fan Content.\nWe reserve the right to change this Policy at any time by posting the revised Policy to our website.\nAny existing Fan Content that no longer complies with this Policy due to a change in the Policy must be modified to be compliant with the Policy.<br>\n&nbsp.\nSection 1 \u2013 General Rules\n1.1 You may create Fan Content based on Epic IP as long as you comply with this Policy.\nAny Fan Content that violates this Policy is prohibited.<br>\n<br>\n1.2 This Policy applies only to Epic IP that you access pursuant to Epic\u2019s Terms of Service, end user license agreements, and/or other agreements you have with Epic.\nFor example, if you have agreed to Epic\u2019s end user license agreement for particular game, then this Policy covers the Fan Content you create based on that game.<br>\n<br>\n1.3 All Fan Content must be appropriate for the audience of the Epic IP and consistent with the spirit and tone of the Epic IP (as determined by Epic).\nFan Content must comply with applicable law, may not violate the rights of others, and must not be obscene, sexually explicit, defamatory, offensive, objectionable, or harmful to others.<br>\n<br>\n1.4 Fan Content must have no commercial (i.e., monetary) objective.\nAs an exception to this, fans are permitted to monetize web videos (such as YouTube) with advertisements, so long as those videos otherwise meet the requirements of this Policy.<br>\n<br>\n1.5 Epic, in its sole discretion, can revoke your permission to create Fan Content at any time and for any reason.<br>\n<br>\n1.6 You may not say nor imply that your Fan Content is endorsed or approved by Epic.<br>\n<br>\n1.7 Your Fan Content may not include links to any website that promotes or exploits cheats or hacks to Epic\u2019s games or any other games.<br>\n<br>\n1.8 You may not create or use any Fan Content in a manner that could cause people to believe that it is an official Epic production.\nFor example, a fan website may not be designed to look like an official Epic website, and it must be clear to visitors that the website is not an Epic website.<br>\n<br>\n1.9 You may not use any Epic IP in any manner that is derogatory to Epic or that may damage the value, reputation, or goodwill of Epic or its products or brands (as determined by Epic).<br>\n<br>\n1.10 You must display the following disclaimer on or in connection with your Fan Content, including on any web page containing your Fan Content:\n<ul>\n<li>Portions of the materials used are trademarks and/or

the reputation and goodwill associated with the Marks.</li>\n<li>Do not use any Marks in the name of a website unless it is clear from the name that the website is not an official Epic website.</li>\n<li>Do not register or use any domain name that is confusingly similar to our domain names.</li>\n<li>Do not alter any Marks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples: <ul>\n<li>\u201cUnreal Engine 4\u201d

be modified or adapted into a new logo.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp.\nSection 2 \u2013 Your Agreements with Epic\nExcept for the limited permission described in Section 1 above, your use of any Epic IP is subject to Epic\u2019s Terms of Service, end user license agreements, and other agreements you may have with Epic regarding the websites, games, and other materials from which you access

creating any Fan Content.<br>\n&nbsp.\nSection 3 - Mods\nAs you know, Epic allows fans to create modifications or enhancements (\u201cMods\u201d) to some of our games pursuant to the end user license agreements for those games.\nPlease note that this Policy does not change our game end user license agreements with respect to Mods.<br>\n&nbsp.\nSection 4 - Do Not Send Epic Your Fan Content or Game

Carolina.&nbsp.\nYou and Epic agree to waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts (without affecting either party\u2019s rights to remove a case to federal court if permissible), as well as any right to a jury trial.&nbsp.\nThe Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.&nbsp.\nAny law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to these Terms.&nbsp.\nThis paragraph will be interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>\n<strong>Binding Individual Arbitration.\nNo Class Actions</strong>\n</u>\n<br>\n<br>\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.&nbsp.\nIT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.<br>\nMost issues can be resolved quickly and amicably by contacting Epic customer support at https://www.epicgames.com/customer-service.\nBut we understand that sometimes disputes can\u2019t be easily resolved by customer support.\nThis Section explains how You and Epic agree to resolve those disputes, including (where applicable) by binding, individual arbitration.<br>\nArbitration is an alternative dispute-resolution procedure that allows us to resolve issues without the formality of going to court.\nAny dispute between You and Epic is submitted to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) for fair and fast resolution.\nArbitration is more efficient for both you and Epic.<br>\n<strong>Disputes related to Epic\u2019s End User License Agreement (\u201cEULA\u201d):</strong> If you have agreed to Epic\u2019s End User License Agreement (\u201cEULA\u201d), \u201cDisputes\u201d as that term is defined in the EULA will be resolved as provided for in the EULA, including the EULA\u2019s \u201cBinding Individual Arbitration\u201d section.&nbsp.\nThe dispute resolution terms below apply to disputes arising solely under these Terms and not to products or services governed by a EULA.<br>\n<strong>Disputes related to these Terms:</strong> If you have an issue related to these Terms and have not agreed to Epic\u2019s EULA, the dispute-resolution terms below apply.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.&nbsp.\nInformal Resolution:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you have an issue that our customer support can\u2019t resolve, prior to starting arbitration You and Epic agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally to help get us to a resolution and control costs for both parties.\nYou and Epic agree to make a good-faith effort to negotiate any dispute between us for at least 30 days (\u201cInformal Resolution\u201d).\nThose informal negotiations will start on the day You or Epic receive a written Notice of a Dispute in accordance with these Terms.<br>\nYou will send your Notice of Dispute to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: NOTICE OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A.\nInclude your name, any relevant account name you use, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want Epic to do.\nIf Epic has a dispute with You, Epic will send our Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.<br>\nIf you reside in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), You may also be entitled to submit Your complaint to the European Commission\u2019s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform.\nODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court.<br>\nIf the dispute isn\u2019t resolved within by Informal Resolution or small-claims court (below), You or Epic may start an arbitration in accordance with these Terms.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>2.&nbsp.\nSmall Claims Court:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nInstead of using Informal Resolution, You and Epic agree that You may sue us in small-claims court in your choice of the county where you live or Wake County, North Carolina (if you meet the requirements of small-claims court).\nWe hope you\u2019ll try Informal Resolution first, but you don\u2019t have to before going to small-claims court.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.\nBinding Individual Arbitration:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nTHE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS IN THIS SECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.<br>\nYou and Epic agree that Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration&nbsp;conducted by the Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc.\n(\u201cJAMS\u201d) subject to the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) as modified by these Terms.<br>\nThis means that You and Epic agree to a dispute-resolution process where we submit any Dispute to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) that makes the final decision to resolve the Dispute.&nbsp.\nJAMS uses experienced professionals to arbitrate disputes, which helps You and Epic resolve any disputes fairly, but more quickly and efficiently than going to court.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator may award the same remedies to you individually as a court could, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.<br>\n&nbsp;The arbitrator\u2019s decision is final, except for a limited review by courts under the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act, and can enforced like any other court order or judgment.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.1 Disputes We Agree to Arbitrate: </strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou and Epic agree to submit all Disputes between You and Epic to individual binding arbitration.\n\u201cDispute\u201d means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between You and Epic that relates to your use or attempted use of Epic\u2019s products or services and Epic\u2019s products and services generally, including without limitation the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Binding Individual Arbitration section.<br>\nYou and Epic agree to arbitrate all Disputes regardless of whether the Dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.<br>\nThe Informal Resolution and Arbitration sections do not apply to (1) individual actions in small-claims court.\n(2) pursuit of enforcement actions through a government agency if the law allows.\n(3) a complaint or remedy under the EU&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation.\n(4) an action to compel or uphold any prior arbitration decision.\n(5) Epic\u2019s right to seek injunctive relief against You in a court of law to preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds.\n(6) claims of piracy, creation, distribution, or promotion of Cheats, and intellectual-property infringement, and (7) the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below.&nbsp;<br>\nYou and Epic agree that whether a dispute is subject to arbitration under these Terms will be determined by the arbitrator rather than a court.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.2 Arbitration Procedure: </strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo start an arbitration, review the JAMS Rules and follow the instructions for initiating an arbitration on the JAMS website.\nThe party starting an arbitration must send JAMS a \u201cDemand for Arbitration\u201d (available on its website), pay a filing fee, and mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party.\nYou will send a copy to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A.\nEpic will send our copy to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.<br>\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single JAMS arbitrator selected with substantial experience in resolving intellectual-property and commercial-contract disputes.\nYou and Epic both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.<br>\nIf an in-person hearing is required, the hearing will take place either in Wake County, North Carolina, or where You reside.\nyou choose.<br>\nThe arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute.\nUnless You and Epic agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator\u2019s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.&nbsp;<br>\nThe arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by You or Epic to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence).&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator may not award relief against Epic respecting any person other than You.<br>\nAny decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.3 Arbitration Fees and Location:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf You start the arbitration, you must pay the JAMS filing fee required for consumer arbitrations.<br>\nIn some situations, Epic will help with your fees to (hopefully) get us to a resolution quickly and fairly:<br>\nIf the Dispute involves $10,000 or less, Epic will pay all of the JAMS costs, including the fees you otherwise would have been required to pay.<br>\nIf the above doesn\u2019t apply to You, but You demonstrate that arbitration costs will be prohibitive compared to litigation costs, Epic will pay as much of your JAMS costs as the arbitrator finds is necessary to prevent arbitration from being cost-prohibitive (as compared to the cost of litigation).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\nEven if Epic wins the arbitration and the applicable law or the JAMS Rules allow Epic to seek our portion of the JAMS fees from you, we won\u2019t.<br>\nThe fee assistance offered above is contingent upon You bringing the arbitration claim in \u201cgood faith\u201d.\nIf the arbitrator finds You brought an arbitration claim against Epic for an improper purpose, frivolously, or without a sufficient pre-claim investigation into the facts or applicable law, then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS rules.&nbsp;<br>\nJAMS costs do not include your Attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and Attorneys\u2019 fees and JAMS costs are not counted when determining how much a dispute involves.<br>\nEpic won\u2019t seek our attorneys\u2019 fees or expenses from you in any arbitration, even if the law or the JAMS rules entitle us to do so.\nIf you choose to be represented by an attorney, you will pay your own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs unless the applicable law provides otherwise.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.4 Notice and Filing:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf a Dispute must be arbitrated, You or Epic must start arbitration of the Dispute within two (2) years from when the Dispute first arose.&nbsp.\nIf applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two years after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period.&nbsp.\nEpic encourages You to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it.\nThe failure to provide timely notice shall bar all claims.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.5 Continuation in Effect:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis Binding Individual Arbitration section survives any termination of these Terms or Epic\u2019s provision of services to You.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.6 Future Terms Changes:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nAlthough Epic may revise these Terms in its discretion, Epic does not have the right to alter these Terms to arbitrate or the rules specified herein with respect to any Dispute once that Dispute arises.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>4.\nClass Action Waiver:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You and Epic agree to only bring Disputes in an individual capacity and shall not:<br>\nseek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions).\nor<br>\nconsolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit an arbitrator to do so without the express consent of all parties to these Terms and all other actions or arbitrations.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>5.\nSeverability:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIf all or any provision of this Binding Individual Arbitration agreement is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then You and Epic agree that the provision will be severed and the rest of these Terms shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included.&nbsp.\nThe sole exception is that if the Class Action Waiver is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, You and Epic agree that it will not be severable.\nthis entire Binding Individual Arbitration section will be void and unenforceable and any dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of clauses specified in these Terms.&nbsp.\nUnder no circumstances shall arbitration be conducted on a class basis without Epic\u2019s express consent.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<u>Language</u>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, the controlling language for these Terms is English.\nIt is the express wish of the parties that these Terms and all related documents have been drawn up in English.\nLes parties d\u00e9clarent qu'elles ont demand\u00e9 et par les pr\u00e9sentes confirment leur desir expr\u00e9s que cette convention soit r\u00e9digee en anglais.\nAny translation has been provided for your convenience.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<u>\n<strong>Waiver and Severability</strong>\n</u>\n<br>\n<br>\nNo waiver of these Terms by Epic shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition, and any failure of Epic to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<br>\n<br>\nIf any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<u>\n<strong>Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement</strong>\n</u>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d) and other applicable law, Epic has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances as determined by Epic, users or account holders who are deemed to be repeat infringers of the copyrights of others.\nEpic may also at its sole discretion limit access to the

the different ways we may use or share it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This policy applies to your use of the Epic services.\nBy \u201cEpic services,\u201d we mean any of our websites, stores, games, game developer tools, applications, or other products or services that link to this policy.\nAdditional terms and conditions may also apply to your relationship with Epic, depending on how you choose to interact with us.\nPlease read this entire policy to make sure you fully understand it.\nYou should also be sure to carefully review other terms potentially applicable to your visit and your use of specific Epic services (such as Fortnite or the use of your Epic Account with third-party games), and confirm that you understand and agree to them, before using the Epic services.</p>\n<p>Epic Games, Inc.\nand our subsidiaries operate and support the Epic services from different locations around the world.\nWhen we say \u201cEpic\u201d or \u201cEpic Games,\u201d we\u2019re referring to the relevant Epic entity identified for your region in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section of the policy below.\nThis Epic entity is responsible for providing the Epic services to you and is the controller of information collected under this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please see \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d below to learn more about sending us any privacy-related questions or concerns you may have.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Information We Collect <p>We generally collect information in three ways: (1) you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by creating an account, making purchases, or signing up for email alerts, (2) we collect information automatically from your use of the Epic services, such as through cookies or our games and other software, and (3) other parties, such as game console platforms and social networks, may provide information to us.\nEach of these methods is described in more detail below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> (1) Information You Provide <p>You may provide your personal information to us when you choose to use the Epic services.\nBecause we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with information also may change.\nSome of the most common examples of situations in which you may provide information to us include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating an Epic account;</li>\n<li>Licensing and downloading our games or game engines;</li>\n<li>Using the Epic services\u2019 social features (see \u201cWhen You Use Social Features of the Epic Services\u201d);</li>\n<li>Purchasing something from us or otherwise engaging in a transaction with us;</li>\n<li>Entering online competitions or registering for or participating in special events;</li>\n<li>Entering contests or sweepstakes, participating in any of our promotions, or accepting any prizes from us;</li>\n<li>Signing up for email alerts or subscribing to receive other information from us;</li>\n<li>Completing a survey;</li>\n<li>Using a mobile device, such as a phone, to play our games or use our applications.\nand</li>\n<li>Contacting us for any reason, such as by email, including for technical support or customer service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The specific types of information you may be able to provide us will often vary depending on the Epic services you are using and how you interact with them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you\u2019ll need an Epic account to access certain parts of the Epic services.\nIf you\u2019d like to create one, you may be asked to provide basic registration details like your name, a public-facing display name, password, country of residence, and email address.\nWe automatically assign each new Epic account with a number (an \u201cEpic account ID\u201d) during the registration process, which helps to uniquely reference your Epic account across the Epic services and facilitate features like cross-play.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to make a purchase, we may ask you to provide billing information (like your card\u2019s payment account number and expiration date) to enable the transaction.\nSometimes we ask for other information like your phone number, postal address, billing address, and date of birth.\nWe\u2019ll also collect information when you choose to share it with us directly in any other way, including by sending it as part of a communication with Epic (like through Player Support requests) or other users of the Epic services (like through in-game chat or forum posts).</p>\n<p>Some of our websites also provide a feature that supports job applications, in which case we also ask for your resume, real name, email address, and phone number.\nWe use this information to determine if you are qualified for the position for which you applied or to contact you to set up an interview.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> (2) Information We Collect Automatically <p>We collect some information automatically when you visit the Epic services.\nWe typically aggregate this data and use it in statistical form to determine trends among groups of users, rather than using it to identify individuals.&nbsp.\nIf a combination of information that we collect does identify you as an individual, we will treat the combined information as personal information.</p>\n<p>We collect information automatically through technologies such as web browsers, cookies, log files, web beacons, and our back-end servers collect usage data transmitted from the Epic services.\nWe use the information for purposes such as modifying or improving features, managing advertising, addressing technical issues, preventing fraud or misuse of our services, and conducting data analytics.\nThe type of information that we automatically collect may vary, but generally includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access the Internet or our services, such as IP address or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system related specifications);</li>\n<li>Usage information and statistics about your interaction with the Epic services, which may include the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, and other usage statistics;</li>\n<li>Crash reports, which may be automatically generated when a game or application crashes and includes information about your system and the crash;</li>\n<li>Information that facilitates a safer and more personalized experience, such as your display name or other user identification provided in connection with your application use or game play, saved preferences, game progress, and device identifiers or usage information for authentication and fraud prevention purposes.\nand</li>\n<li>The location of your device, such as may be derived from your device\u2019s IP address.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that if certain features on the Epic services are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of the Epic services or others\u2019 websites over time.\nThese features are subject to those third parties\u2019 privacy notices and policies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fraud Prevention &amp.\nAnti-Cheat</em>:</p>\n<p>Providing users with a fair, balanced, and competitive experience on the Epic services is extremely important to us.\nWe strictly enforce prohibitions against cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the Epic services.\nWhen you create an Epic account, buy our products or services, play our games, or otherwise interact with the Epic on or through the Epic services, we may use a variety of anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies to help us identify and prevent malicious activity.\nThese services may collect and analyze data about the game binary or your computer to detect cheating, and may be provided by Epic or by third parties such as BattleEye.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> (3) Information We Receive from Others <p>In some cases, other parties provide us with information about you, or allow us to collect information about you.\nWe generally collect information from other parties in four ways: (1) you interact with Epic using a service that is not controlled by us, such as a social network, (2) you choose to use a social feature of the Epic services, (3) you access Epic services through another party, such as a gaming console or mobile device operator, or (4) you link a third party account to your Epic account.\nIn some cases, we are not able to control the amount or type of information that other parties, like social networks, make available to us.\nIn those cases, we use only the data that we need to provide the types of services we think our users want and expect.\nAlthough we cannot control your privacy settings at those websites or how those other parties protect your privacy, once we receive information about you through those websites, we will treat it in accordance with this policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>When You Interact with Epic on Third Party Services</em>\n</p>\n<p>When you interact with Epic on a website or app not controlled by Epic, that website or app may allow Epic access to certain information about you.\nFor example, social networks may provide us with information from your profile on their services or other information that you agreed the social network or other party could provide to us.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>When You Use Social Features of the Epic Services</em>\n</p>\n<p>When you choose to use some of the Epic services\u2019 social features, you allow Epic to receive information about you from third parties (like social networks).\nOur social features promote and facilitate interaction among players, such as by allowing you and your friends to work together to meet a shared challenge presented by our game or application.\nYou may be able to use these features to find out if your friends are actively playing the game and using the feature, to find out if they used it in the past, and to invite them to join with you to meet a game challenge.</p>\n<p>If you choose to use one of our social features, you may be asked to log into a social network through our game or application.\nThe social network may then provide Epic with information such as your social network user ID, your profile picture, and the user IDs and profile pictures of your connections.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>When You Access Epic Services through Other Parties or Devices</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may also receive information about you from the organizations that sell our games or applications, or which provided the gaming system you use.\nThose parties may provide us with information regarding your account or registration, but they do not give us your payment information.\nBecause those organizations determine what information they will collect from you, it may vary according to their services, but is likely to include details such as your display name and user ID for those services, as well as device and region information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>When You Link a Third Party Account to Your Epic Account</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to link a third party account, such as a gaming console or social media account, to your Epic account, the third party will provide Epic with information about that account.\nBecause those organizations determine what information they will collect from you, it may vary according to their services, but is likely to include details such as your third party account display name and user ID, as well as associated device information, name, and email address.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> How We Use and Share Information <p>As a general matter, we use and share the information we collect (either individually or in combination with other information collected as described in this policy) to help us provide, improve, customize, analyze, and market the Epic services where we have an appropriate basis to do so.</p> (1) Use <p>We rely on several different legal bases to process personal information for the purposes disclosed in this policy.\nThese often depend on the exact nature of your relationship with Epic, but common examples include:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To support our legitimate interests, such as:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>To communicate with you, respond to your requests, or provide you with updates and information;</li>\n<li>To better understand our users and their preferences;</li>\n<li>To personalize your experience, save your preferences, authenticate our users, and provide similar user-experience features;</li>\n<li>To develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, and other offerings, some of which may be offered in partnership with other parties;</li>\n<li>To manage and customize advertisements or promotional offers;</li>\n<li>For security purposes.\nand</li>\n<li>For internal purposes such as auditing and data analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide services that are subject to terms you have accepted, such as enforcing our licenses, agreements, and terms of service, which may include reasonable monitoring to detect and prevent misuse or fraud, keep our games fair for all users, and otherwise protect and defend the Epic services.</li>\n<li>When you give consent, which you can withdraw at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We store personal information for as long as we reasonably need it to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected.\nFor example, if you create an Epic account, we will store the personal information associated with your Epic account for as long as needed to maintain your account, provide the Epic services you requested, enforce any applicable terms that govern your use of the Epic services, and maintain appropriate records to reflect our delivery of the Epic services to you.\nWe periodically review the personal information we retain to determine whether continued storage is proper.&nbsp;</p> (2) Sharing <p>\n<em>Service Providers.</em> We share personal information with service providers that we\u2019ve engaged to help support the Epic services by performing certain services on our behalf and under our instructions.\nFor example, if you make a purchase on the Epic services, we\u2019ll generally share your billing information with a third-party payment processor to enable your transaction.\nOther common examples include partners that assist with cloud storage, email marketing of products and services offered by Epic, Player Support ticketing, and monitoring and securing the Epic services.\nThese service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose personal information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Affiliates</em>.\nWe may share personal information we collect with Epic Games, Inc.\nsubsidiaries to support the Epic services worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>Marketing Partners.\n</em>We may share certain limited information, such as device identifiers, with marketing partners for purposes of executing and optimizing campaigns, and gauging the effectiveness of advertising and other marketing strategies solely on Epic's behalf.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Epic Games Store Partners</em>.\nIf you purchase a game from the Epic Games Store, we may share certain information associated with your Epic account with the game\u2019s developer or publisher to support your gameplay and permit them to contact you for appropriate purposes.\nFor example, to support gameplay we may share your Epic account ID and entitlement to the game.\nTo support in-game social features we may also share your Epic display name and your Epic friends list.\nYou may also opt-in to share your contact information with a game\u2019s developer or publisher.</p>\n<p>If a store partner removes their game from the Epic Games Store, we also will transfer information necessary to support your continued gameplay on another platform to them.\nWhen Epic provides your information to these independent developers and publishers, their use and disclosure of the information is governed by limitations in our agreements with them.\nHowever, they also provide their end users with privacy notices or policies that govern their use of your information.\nPersonal information you share with them or that is not provided by Epic will be subject to the developers\u2019 and publishers\u2019 privacy notices and policies, and may not be subject to this policy.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Epic Account Services.</em> If you sign in to a third-party developer\u2019s game or application using your Epic account, you may choose to share details about your Epic account such as your Epic account ID, Epic display name, linked account identifiers, online presence, and your Epic friends using the same game or application.\nThese third-party developers\u2019 uses of this Epic account information is governed by limitations in our agreements with them.\nPersonal information you share with them or which is not provided by Epic is subject to the third-party developers\u2019 privacy notices and policies, which may differ from Epic\u2019s practices as described in this policy.\nPlease review third-party developers\u2019 privacy policies carefully, and ensure you understand and are comfortable with how they handle your information, before using your Epic account to access their products or services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Social Features.</em> We may share, or provide you with opportunities to share, information about you with other users of the Epic services as described in this policy.\nWe also provide services that allow our users to communicate with Epic and each other, in which case personal information may be shared and account IDs may be displayed.\nFor example, we may share information about you with your social contacts when you and they use the same social features of our games and applications.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law, legal process, or a reasonable request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, (ii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, or (iii) if necessary to protect the vital interests of another individual (such as to prevent death, bodily harm, or serious damage to property).\nWe reserve the right to transfer information about our users in the event we sell or transfer all or substantially all our business or assets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Your Choices and Controls <p>We seek to provide you with meaningful choices about the personal information you share with Epic, as well as the ways we may use or share that information.We\u2019ll generally only ask you for personal information that is necessary to provide the Epic services you request.\nYou can choose not to give us personal information we request, but if you decide not to, you may not be able to access certain parts of the Epic services and some features may not work as intended.</p>\n<p>We may also seek your prior consent to process your information in certain ways.\nYou aren\u2019t required to provide consent if you do not want your personal information to be processed for the requested purposes, and may withdraw your consent at any time.\nAny withdrawal of consent is only effective on a going-forward basis and will not impact processing we undertook while relying on your consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We provide you with the ability to request access to, and correction or deletion of, your personal information.\nYou can update your account information or request that we delete your Epic account directly through the Epic services at any time.\nIf you would like to request access to personal information associated with your Epic account, please see the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other examples of your choices include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can browse our website without providing any personal information.\nWe may collect some limited information automatically, as described above.</li>\n<li>You may opt out of receiving our marketing messages at any time by using the opt-out mechanism provided in the message.</li>\n<li>You can change your privacy settings on other parties\u2019 websites, such as social networks, which will stop or limit our receipt of information from those other websites.\nYou also may choose not to use social features we make available.\nIf you choose to use these features, you should refrain from posting personal information that will be visible to others, such as including your email address in a forum or during a chat.</li>\n<li>You may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies.\nNot all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser \u201cdo not track\u201d signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies.\nIn some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause our websites, games, and applications not to work as intended and some features may not be available.</li>\n<li>You can limit interest-based advertising by opting out at www.aboutads.info/choices/ or www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.\nIf you are located in Europe, more information is available at www.youronlinechoices.eu/.</li>\n<li>If you are under the age of 18 and have an account for our websites, mobile apps, game engines, games, or other online services, you may request that we remove certain content that you provided, such as deleting or editing comments you have posted.\nYou also may ask us to assist you in removing or anonymizing content you have posted by contacting us as described in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section of this policy.\nPlease be aware that taking these steps may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted on our websites, online services, applications, or games.\nWe also may not be able to remove content you post if applicable law requires us to maintain the posting or if another party has re-posted the content to a website, app, game or other online service that we do not own or control.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also exercise and amend your choices by sending an email to us as detailed in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>\n<em>EEA and UK Residents.\n</em>If you are an EEA or UK resident, you may have the right to access your information, the right to correct your information, the right to request deletion of your personal information, the right to request restricted processing of your personal information, the right to a portable copy of the personal information you have provided, and the right to object to processing of your personal information, such as for direct marketing.\nFor more information about exercising these rights, send an email to the address specified in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>EEA and UK residents may contact Epic\u2019s data protection officer with any questions or concerns about our handling of personal information at dpo@epicgames.com.\nEEA and UK residents also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority if they have concerns about Epic\u2019s handling of personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<em>California Residents.\n</em>If you are a California resident and are not a job applicant, employee or employee of another company interacting with us in your job, you have the right to ask us what personal information we have collected and shared about you, the right to request deletion of your personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of these rights.\nFor more information about exercising these rights, send an email to the address specified in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sales of Information.\n</em>Epic only uses the personal information we collect to help provide, support, and improve the Epic services as described in this policy, and we do not sell this information to third parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> How We Protect Information <p>We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use and other unlawful forms of processing.\nIn some cases, your information is accessible when you log into a feature we offer, and in those cases you need to keep your user credentials and password confidential and secure so that your information is protected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Children\u2019s Privacy <p>The Epic services are intended to be appropriate for general audiences and are not directed to children (usually considered to be under 13, depending on where you reside).\nEpic does not intentionally collect personal information from children without seeking any required parental approval in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, such as the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d).</p>\n<p>We may ask you to provide age-related information in order to help us comply with laws like COPPA.\nFor example, we may request your date of birth to determine whether COPPA requires us to obtain verifiable parental consent from your parent or guardian before allowing you to access the Epic services.</p>\n<p>If a user indicates they are a COPPA minor, we\u2019ll require that user to complete a parental approval process before continuing to access the relevant Epic services.\nThis process is designed to notify parents that their child has requested access to the Epic services, inform them about Epic\u2019s privacy practices, offer them the opportunity to approve Epic\u2019s collection and use of their child\u2019s information as described in this policy, and describe the controls that we make available to them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once a parent provides their consent, we\u2019ll give them an opportunity to review and change important account settings that control how their child can interact with the Epic services.\nTo learn more, see https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/parental-controls.\nParents are also generally free to change or revoke the choices they\u2019ve previously made, and can review the personal information associated with their child\u2019s account or request that we delete it from our systems.\nTo submit these requests or ask us any other questions you may have about how we handle your child\u2019s personal information, please see \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d below.</p>\n<p>Authorized child accounts are otherwise treated much like other Epic accounts.\nThey can generally play approved games (such as Fortnite), access communications and social features (like chat and friends lists), and freely interact with most of the Epic services (including downloading other games from the Epic Games Store).\nFor additional details, please see the \u201cInformation We Collect\u201d and \u201cHow We Use and Share Information\u201d sections of the policy above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Transfers of Information <p>Epic Games is a company with operations around the world.\nBy using the Epic services, you acknowledge and agree that your information may be processed outside your country of residence, including in other jurisdictions (like the United States) that may have different data protection frameworks than your region.\nTo learn more about the Epic entity responsible for operating the Epic services in your region, see \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d below.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve implemented and maintain a framework consistent with applicable law and this policy for transfers of information outside the country of collection.\nFor example, when we transfer personal data collected in the European Union to locations outside the European Economic Area, we rely on transfer mechanisms adopted by the European Commission to help establish adequate safeguards, like Standard Contractual Clauses.\nWe may also need to transfer your information to provide the Epic services to you in accordance with our existing agreements with you, such as the Terms of Service.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Updates to Our Privacy Policy <p>This policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our personal information practices or relevant laws.\nWe will indicate at the top of this policy when this policy was last updated.\nPlease review this policy every time you access or use the Epic services to make sure that you have reviewed the most recent version.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> How to Contact Us <p>If you have general questions or concerns about the Epic services (such as game-related issues, trouble accessing your Epic account, bugs or other technical problems, payment matters, or content and entitlement issues), please contact our Player Support team.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Epic\u2019s privacy practices or this policy, please email your questions to privacy@epicgames.com or send them to us via postal mail (marked \u201cAttn: Legal Department\u201d) at the appropriate address listed below.\nYou can also contact our Data Protection Officer directly at dpo@epicgames.com.\nThe
