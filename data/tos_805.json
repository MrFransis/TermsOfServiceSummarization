via the Services may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of our Services.\nWe also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services.\nWe also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form and content that you share publicly when using the services (e.g., user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising.\nWe neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that

make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers.\nDNT is a way for users to inform online services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide links to the&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance&nbsp;opt-out pages, as well as choices provided by Google Ads, Google Analytics, and TrustArc.\nHowever, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT

authority.</p>\n<p>Many of the rights described here are subject to significant limitations and exceptions under applicable law (e.g., objections to the processing of personal data, and withdrawals of

about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data.\nTo the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds for processing your personal data are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To Honor Our Contractual Commitments to You.</strong>&nbsp;Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our customers, or to take steps at customers\u2019 request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong>&nbsp;In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in commercial activities such as the following in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer service</li>\n<li>Marketing</li>\n<li>Protecting our customers, personnel and property</li>\n<li>Analyzing and improving our business</li>\n<li>Managing
