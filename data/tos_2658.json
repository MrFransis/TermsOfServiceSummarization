Since the full form of the Internet Protocol address is personal, you have the following rights in particular: View rights </li>\n<li> Entered search query Entered search terms are mandatory for a web search.\nAs a rule, personal data cannot be obtained from them.\npartly because they have no fixed structure.\nBeispiele Water consumption when showering<br> Lyrics from the song There was a bird on a

results for display on the results page.\nThe results, including the search term, are kept for display for a few hours.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> User Agent Name When a website is opened, your browser automatically sends an identifier, usually with data about the browser and operating system used.\nThis browser identifier (the so-called user agent) can be used by web pages, for example, to recognize mobile devices and present them with a customized output.\nExample Mozilla/5.0 (X11.\nUbuntu.\nLinux x86_64.\nrv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0 What does MetaGer/SUMA-EV do with it?

agent in connection with the first two blocks of the so-called IP-Adresse to our advertising partners.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> User preferences In addition to form data and user agent, the browser often transmits additional data.\nThese include language selection, search settings, accept header, do-not-track header and more.\nExamples interface=de sprachfilter=all fokus=web<br> interface=de

transparent <p>MetaGer is transparent.\nOur source code is Quellcodefreely licensed and publicly available for all to see.\nWe do not store user data and value data protection and privacy.\nTherefore we grant anonymous access to the search results.\nThis is possible through an anonymous proxy and TOR-hidden access.\nIn addition, MetaGer has a transparent organizational structure, since it is supported by the non-profit association SUMA-EV, of which anyone can become a member.</p> What is a metasearch engine? <p>To explain what metasearch engines are, it makes sense to first briefly explain roughly how the indexing of regular search engines works.\nRegular search engines obtain their search results from a database of web pages, which is also called an index.\nThe search engines use so-called \"crawlers\", which collect web pages and add them to the index (database).\nThe crawler starts with a set of web pages and opens all the web pages linked there.\nThese are indexed, i.e.\nadded to the index.\nThen the crawler opens the web pages linked on these web pages and continues in this way.</p>\n<p>A metasearch engine combines the results of several search engines and evaluates them again according to its own criteria.This means that the metasearch engine does not have its own index.\nTherefore, metasearch engines do not use crawlers.\nThey use the index of other search engines.</p> What is the advantage of a metasearch engine? <p>A clear advantage of metasearch engines is that the user only needs a single search query to access the results of several search engines.\nThe metasearch engine outputs the relevant results in a once again sorted list of results.\nMetaGer is not a pure metasearch engine, as we also use small indexes of our own.</p> How is our ranking made up? <p>We take the rankings from our source search engines and weigh them.\nThese rankings are then converted into scores.\nAdditional points are awarded or deducted for the occurrence of the search terms in the URL and in the snippet, as well as the excessive occurrence of special characters (e.g.\nother character sets such as Cyrillic).\nWe also use a blocking list to remove individual pages from the results list.\nWe block web pages in the display if we are legally obliged to do so.\nWe also reserve the right to block web pages with demonstrably incorrect information, web pages of extremely poor quality and other particularly dubious web pages.</p>\n<p>If there are any further questions or uncertainties, please feel free to use our contact form and ask us your
