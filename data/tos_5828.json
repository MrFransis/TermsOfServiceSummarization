Illinois, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>\n<p>Exceptions to Binding Arbitration.\nAs an exception to binding arbitration, you and Company both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any claim that is within that court\u2019s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis.\nCompany will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is pending only in that court.\nBinding arbitration also does not apply to disputes concerning trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, copyright infringement or misuse, or trademark infringement or dilution.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Mandatory Pre-Dispute Procedures</u>.You acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim (subject to the exceptions above) against Company, you will first give us an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute.\nThis includes sending a written description of your

you and Company agree.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Sponsoring Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator</u>.\nYou agree that any Claims shall be resolved by submitting the dispute to final and binding confidential

Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the arbitration rules of the selected tribunal shall apply, which can be obtained by calling the selected tribunal.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms and Conditions and this arbitration provision.\nThe

either party.\nThe parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Arbitration Award</u>.\nThe arbitrator shall follow substantive law and may order any relief if permitted by law.\nThe arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and punitive damages, so long as they are in accordance with applicable law.\nThe arbitrator may award costs or fees to a prevailing party, but only if the law expressly allows it.\nAlthough Company may have a right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses under some laws if it prevails, Company agrees that it will not seek such an award, unless your Claims are determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous.\nNothing herein shall be construed to limit the arbitrator\u2019s ability to award remedies provided by applicable law.\nAny award rendered shall include a written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Enforceability</u>.\nThis provision survives your relationship with Company, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer.\nIf the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply.\nIf a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Miscellaneous</u>.\nFailure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims.\nThis provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Company and shall not be modified except in writing by Company.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Amendments</u>.\nCompany reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time.\nYour continued use of any Company Website, or
