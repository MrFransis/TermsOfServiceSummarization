(1) month term (a \"Negotiation Period\").\nprovided that Company may in its sole discretion notify Publisher that such Negotiation Period will not occur, in which case these Terms of Service will expire as provided herein.\nPublisher will for the Negotiation Period be invoiced, and will pay in accordance with the payment terms herein, one-twelfth of the annual Fees provided on the applicable Order Form, and the License Scope for Content Plays, Hosting and Streaming will be one-twelfth of the annual limits provided on such Order Form.\nThe Negotiation Period will not renew without the

Section B, we describe the information that is collected from Users who view videos and ads on a Customer Property.\nThe JW Player Technology collects <b>Usage Data</b> and <b>Tracking Data</b> from

DATA</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Usage Data and Tracking Data Collected by the JW Player Technology.\nThe JW Player Technology collects Usage Data and Tracking Data from a User when he or she views video on a Customer Property.\nAs used in our discussion about the JW Player Technology in this Section B:\n\u201c<b>Usage Data</b>\u201d is the information that a User\u2019s browser automatically sends to JW Player\u2019s servers when a User accesses video or sees an ad on a Customer Property.\nThis information includes a User\u2019s device type, screen resolution, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version.\n<p>\u201c<b>Tracking Data</b>\u201d is the information collected by the JW Player Technology from Users who access videos on a Customer Property, and consists primarily of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Proprietary tracking technologies</b> used by the JW Player Technology for video delivery and performance reporting.\nThese tracking technologies include the following:\n<ul>\n<li>Local ID, which is stored on a User\u2019s computer to identify a User\u2019s player on a given Customer Property.</li>\n<li>Global ID, which is stored on a User\u2019s browser and JW Player\u2019s servers and identifies a User across different players and Customer Properties.\n<b>The JW Player Technology does not assign a Global ID to Users whose Internet Protocol (IP) addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland and the UK.</b>\n</li>\n<li>Viewer ID, which is stored on JW Player\u2019s servers to identify a User.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Other tracking technologies include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used for ad delivery and reporting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAs with other Internet services, our web servers gather information automatically each time a User\u2019s browser or device interacts with the JW Player Technology, and store that information in \u201c<b>log files.</b>\u201d The information stored in our web servers\u2019 log files includes Usage Data and Tracking Data.\nThe Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information collected through tracking technologies.</li>\n<li>Browser type and version.</li>\n<li>User\u2019s Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li>\n<li>Unique identifiers set by our tracking technologies to identify video players, Users, and video sessions.</li>\n<li>If

IP address, device operating system, and diagnostic data.</li>\n<li>Information about how a User interacts with the JW Player Technology, such as the date and time of a User\u2019s visit, the videos watched, and the time spent watching those videos.</li>\n<li>Other aggregated information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Note for visitors who access the JW Player Technology from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK:</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Personal Data.</b> As previously noted, some elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data \u2013 for example, a visitor\u2019s full Internet Protocol (IP) address, and the information that we associate with a unique identifier (like a cookie or other tracking technology) \u2013 are Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and we treat those elements as Personal Data when collected by the JW Player Technology from Users whose IP addresses are based in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK.\nNote that the JW Player Technology does not assign a Global ID to a User accessing the JW Player Technology from an EEA, Swiss or UK IP address.\nWe will retain those elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are Personal Data under the GDPR for the

or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our legal agreements or policies.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Legal grounds for processing Personal Data on Customer Properties.</b> For Users who access the JW Player Technology from IP addresses in the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK, we process the elements of Usage Data and Tracking Data that are considered Personal Data under the GDPR.\nThe GDPR makes a distinction between organizations that process Personal Data for their own purposes (known as \u201c<b>data controllers</b>\u201d) and organizations that process Personal Data on behalf of other organizations (known as \u201c<b>data processors</b>\u201d).\nWhen we handle Personal Data strictly on behalf of our customers in order to provide our services to them, as is the case with the JW Player Technology, we are a data processor and our customers, as the data controllers, have primary responsibility for your Personal Data and are responsible for obtaining a legal basis to collect such data.\nIf you have questions about Personal Data that is used primarily by a Customer Property on which the JW Player Technology is embedded or utilized, you should contact those companies with your questions about how they handle your Personal Data.\n<p>With that in mind, if you have concerns about JW Player, you may contact our privacy officer, at privacy@jwplayer.com.</p>

and Tracking Data.\nWe may disclose Usage Data and Tracking Data collected by the JW Player Technology for the following purposes:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Service Providers.</b> To third-party service

web browser.\nWe make reasonable efforts to maintain compatibility between our technology and Do Not Track functionality across different web browsers.\nHowever, you should be aware that, despite our reasonable efforts, there may be circumstances in which a particular Do Not Track setting is not recognized and honored.\n<p>Note that even if a User enables and JW Player recognizes Do Not Track, the

will not be associated with a unique identifier, and the JW Player Technology will not be able to associate such User Data collected with User.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Check Our Customers\u2019 Privacy Policy.\nUsers interact with the JW Player Technology, because our Customers have implemented the JW Player Technology in their Customer Properties.\nWe recommend that Users check the privacy policy
