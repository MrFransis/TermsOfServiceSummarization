applies to the use of any product, service or website provided by us (HubSpot), whether we provide it directly or use another party to provide it to you (each, a \"HubSpot Service\").\nThis AUP is designed to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to the HubSpot Service.\nThis AUP also protects the interests of all of our clients and their customers, as well as our goodwill and reputation.\nThese terms are so important that we cannot provide the HubSpot Service unless you agree to them.\nBy using the HubSpot Service, you are agreeing to these terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.\nReporting Suspected Violations</p>\n<p>2.\nProhibited Email Actions</p>\n<p>3.\nEmail Opt-Out Requirements</p>\n<p>4.\nTelephone Marketing</p>\n<p>5.\nNo Disruption</p>\n<p>6.\nProper Usage of the HubSpot Service</p>\n<p>7.\nRestricted Industries</p>\n<p>8.\nHubSpot Trademark Use</p>\n<p>9.\nDeveloper Terms</p>\n<p>10.\nGeneral Terms</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are using any HubSpot Service, this AUP applies to you.\nEvery client of ours agrees to abide by this AUP and is responsible for any violations.\nYou are not allowed to assist or engage others in a way that would violate this AUP.\nWe will enforce and ensure compliance with this AUP by using methods we consider to be appropriate, such as complaint and email failure monitoring.&nbsp.\nWe may also suspend or terminate your use of HubSpot Services pursuant to our Customer Terms of Service for violations of this AUP.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We periodically update these terms and we will let you know when we do through the Notification app in the HubSpot portal used to access your HubSpot subscription (if you have one), or by posting a revised copy on our website.\nYou agree to review the AUP on a regular basis and always remain in compliance.</p> 1.<strong>&nbsp;Reporting Suspected Violations</strong>\n<p>We encourage recipients of email messages sent using the HubSpot Service to report suspected&nbsp;violations&nbsp;of this AUP to us by forwarding a copy of the received email with FULL headers to&nbsp;abuse@hubspot.com.\nWe have a policy to&nbsp;investigate all of these reports and to respond in the way we consider appropriate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you know of or suspect a violation of this AUP, you will promptly notify&nbsp;us&nbsp;in writing of the known or suspected violation of this AUP.</p> 2.<strong>&nbsp;Prohibited Email Actions&nbsp;</strong>\n<p>a.&nbsp;You may not use HubSpot to send spam.\nSpam can be in the form of bulk email or one to one commercial emails.</p>\n<p>Bulk email is spam when it is unsolicited.\nUnsolicited means the recipient has not granted verifiable permission for the message to be sent.\nBulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages that have substantively similar content.\n<br>One-to-one commercial emails are spam when they violate CAN-SPAM.\nOne-to-one commercial emails are also considered Spam if the data processed for purposes of sending that email is in scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u2018GDPR\u2019) and you fail to provide notice to individuals and establish a lawful basis of processing.</p>\n<p>You may not use the HubSpot Service in any way (directly or indirectly) to send, transmit, handle, distribute or deliver: (a)&nbsp;spam in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act (referenced below) or any other law.\n(b) email to an address obtained via Internet harvesting methods or any surreptitious methods (e.g., scraping or harvesting).\n(c) email to an address that is incomplete, inaccurate and/or not updated for all applicable opt-out notifications, using best efforts and best practices in the industry, (d) commercial electronic messages in violation of Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Legislation (referenced below), or&nbsp;(e) in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>b.\nYou may not use any misleading or false names, addresses, email address, or subject line.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Email sent, or caused to be sent to or through the HubSpot Service may not: (a) use or contain invalid or forged headers.\n(b) use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names.\n(c) employ any technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path.\n(d) use other means of deceptive addressing.\n(e) use a third party's internet domain name&nbsp;without their consent, or be relayed from or through a third party's equipment without the third party\u2019s permission.\n(f) contain false or misleading information in the subject line or otherwise contain false or misleading content.\nor (g) use&nbsp;our&nbsp;trademark(s), tagline(s), or logo(s) without our prior written consent and only then pursuant to&nbsp;our&nbsp;trademark usage guidelines.</p>\n<p>If you use email, we recommend&nbsp;that you adopt the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group (M<sup>3</sup>AAWG) Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP), which were created and agreed upon with collaborative input from both volume email senders and Internet Service Providers.\nThe Sender Best Communications Practices document is available here.\nYou will use commercially reasonable efforts to follow these practices.</p>\n<p>c.\nYou may not email purchased lists.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You are prohibited from using the HubSpot Service to email: (a) purchased, rented, or borrowed lists, and&nbsp;(b) lists that are likely to result in an excessive number of unsubscribe requests or Spam complaints or notices, as determined by acceptable industry practices.</p> 3.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Email Opt-out Requirements</strong>&nbsp.\n<p>You warrant that each email you send or is sent for you using the HubSpot Service will contain: (a) header information that is not false or misleading.\nand (b) an advisement that the recipient may unsubscribe, opt-out or otherwise demand that use of its information for unsolicited, impermissible and/or inappropriate communication(s) as described in this AUP be stopped (and how the recipient can notify you that it wants to unsubscribe, opt-out, or stop this use of its information).&nbsp;These requirements may not apply if the email sent is a transactional email and these requirements are not otherwise required by law.&nbsp;You warrant that you will promptly comply with all opt-out, unsubscribe, \"do not call\" and \"do not send\" requests.</p> 4.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Telephone Marketing</strong>\n<p>You must comply with all laws relating to telephone marketing, including without limitation those specifically referenced in the \u2018Proper Usage of HubSpot Service\u2019 section below.\nYou must comply with all laws related to the recording of phone calls and ensure all proper consent to record is obtained prior to making any such recording.\nIf you use the HubSpot Service to place telephone calls, you must also comply with all applicable industry standards, including those applicable guidelines published by the CTIA and the Mobile Marketing Association.\nYou are prohibited from using or permitting access to use the HubSpot Service to make emergency calls or to provide or seek emergency services.</p> 5.<strong>&nbsp;No Disruption</strong>\n<p>You agree not to:</p>\n<p>(a) use the HubSpot Service in a way that impacts the normal operation, privacy, integrity or security of another's property.&nbsp.\nAnother\u2019s property includes another\u2019s

use the HubSpot Service to gain unauthorized access to, use, monitor, make an unauthorized reference to, another\u2019s property, unless you have the appropriate express prior consent to do so.\nor</p>\n<p>(g) use the HubSpot Service in a way that causes or may cause any HubSpot IP addresses, HubSpot domains, or HubSpot customer domains to be blacklisted.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Examples of prohibited actions include (without limitation) include hacking, spoofing, denial of service, mailbombing and/or sending any email that contains or transmits any virus or propagating worm(s), or any malware, whether spyware, adware or other such file or program.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These restrictions apply regardless of your intent and whether or not you act intentionally or unintentionally.</p> 6.<strong>&nbsp;Proper Usage of the HubSpot Service</strong>\n<p>You will respect the limits that apply to your use the HubSpot Service as specified in the Product and Services Catalog available

Ireland Limited, and our affiliated entities listed on this page use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our Websites (www.hubspot.com, www.hubspot.de, www.hubspot.fr, www.hubspot.es, www.hubspot.jp, br.hubspot.com, and www.inbound.com).\nIt explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What are cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.\nWhen you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser.\nCookies may store user preferences and other information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cookies provide a convenience feature to save you time, or tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, HubSpot) are called \"first party cookies\".\nCookies set by parties other than the website owner are called \"third party cookies\".&nbsp.\nThird party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g.\nlike advertising, interactive content and analytics).\nThe parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons.\nSome cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as \"essential\" or \"strictly necessary\" cookies.\nOther cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites and Subscription Service.&nbsp.\nFor example, HubSpot keeps track of the Websites and pages you visit within HubSpot, in order to determine what portion of the HubSpot Website or Subscription Service is the most popular or most used.\nThis data is used to deliver customized content and promotions within the HubSpot Website and Subscription Service to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.\nThird parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.&nbsp.\nThis is described in more detail below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What types of cookies do we use and how do we use them?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform.\nFor a list of the cookies used by HubSpot, see this page.\nThese cookies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essential website cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Websites.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Performance and functionality cookies: These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites but are non-essential to their use.\nHowever, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</li>\n<li>Analytics and customisation cookies: These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Websites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customise our Websites for you.</li>\n<li>Advertising cookies: These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.\nThey perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.</li>\n<li>Social networking cookies: These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Websites through third party social networking and other websites.\nThese cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>How can I control cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\nYou can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided below.</p>\n<p>You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.\nIf you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted.\nAs the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p>\n<p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising.&nbsp.\nIf you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com.\nYou may opt out by clicking here: http://optout.aboutads.info/&nbsp;or&nbsp;http://optout.networkadvertising.org/&nbsp;&nbsp;(or if located in the European Union, by clicking here: http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/).\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic advertisements.</p>\n<p>Essential website cookies: Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Websites to you, you cannot refuse them.\nYou can block or delete them by changing your browser settings however, as described above.</p>\n<p>Click here to remove HubSpot's tracking cookies from your browser.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website.&nbsp.\nWe employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.\nWeb Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage the Website and Subscription Service by informing us what content is effective.\nClear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.&nbsp.\nIn contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.\nWe use clear gifs or pixels in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nWe tie the information gathered by clear gifs in emails to our customers' Personal Information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) use technology to remember settings, preferences and usage similar to browser cookies but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser.\nThis technology creates locally stored objects that are often referred to as \"Flash cookies.\" HubSpot does not use Flash cookies.\nHowever, our customers of our software platform may create pages on the HubSpot platform that employ Adobe Flash cookies.&nbsp.\nHubSpot does not have access or control over our customers' Flash cookies, but you may access your Flash management tools from Adobe's web site directly here.</p>\n<p>Similarly, our customers may create pages using the HubSpot Subscription Service that use technology from tracking utility companies, such as cookies and web beacons.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThe use of these technologies by our customers is not covered by our Cookie Policy or Privacy Notice.&nbsp.\nWe do not have control over third party cookies or trackers our customers use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do you serve targeted advertising?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites.\nThese companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in.\nThey may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements.\nThis can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you.\nThe information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.\nWe will notify you of any material changes to this Cookie Policy prior to the changes becoming effective by posting the changes on this page and providing a more prominent notice with on-site or email notifications.\nPlease therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Where can I get further information?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at privacy@hubspot.com.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-02-04 19:00:04.636846",

obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;</p>\n<p>(c) that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred;</p>\n<p>(d) that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:</p>\n<p>(i) any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation;</p>\n<p>(ii) any accidental or unauthorised access.\nand</p>\n<p>(iii) any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so;</p>\n<p>(e) to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred;</p>\n<p>(f) at the request of the data exporter to submit its data-processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority;</p>\n<p>(g) to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;</p>\n<p>(h) that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent;</p>\n<p>(i) that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11;</p>\n<p>(j) to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<i>Clause 6</i>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Liability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1.\nThe parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.</p>\n<p>2.\nIf a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.\nThe data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.</p>\n<p>3.\nIf a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.\nThe liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<i>Clause 7</i>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mediation and jurisdiction</strong>\n</p>\n1.\nThe data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:<br>\n<p>(a)&nbsp.\nto refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;<br>(b)&nbsp.\nto refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.</p>\n<p>2.\nThe parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<i>Clause 8</i>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cooperation with supervisory authorities</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1.\nThe data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.</p>\n<p>2.\nThe parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.</p>\n<p>3.\nThe data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2.\nIn such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5(b).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<i>Clause 9</i>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Governing law</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<i>Clause 10</i>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Variation of the contract</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses.\nThis does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<i>Clause 11</i>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Subprocessing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1.\nThe data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter.\nWhere the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses.\nWhere the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor\u2019s obligations under such agreement.</p>\n<p>2.\nThe prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law.\nSuch third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.</p>\n<p>3.\nThe provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.</p>\n<p>4.\nThe data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at least once a year.\nThe list shall be available to the data exporter\u2019s data protection supervisory authority.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<i>Clause 12</i>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Obligation after the termination of personal data-processing services</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1.\nThe parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data-processing services, the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred.\nIn that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.</p>\n<p>2.\nThe data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data-processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Appendix 1 to the Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Appendix forms part of the

exporter agrees that these Clauses constitute data importer's Confidential Information as that term is defined in the Agreement and may not be disclosed by data exporter to any third party without data importer's prior written consent unless permitted pursuant to Agreement.&nbsp.\nThis shall not prevent disclosure of these Clauses to a data subject pursuant to Clause 4(h) or a supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 8.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clauses 5(a) and 5(b): Suspension of data transfers and termination</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\nThe parties acknowledge that data importer may process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions as provided by the data exporter and the Clauses.</p>\n<p>b.\nThe parties acknowledge that if data importer cannot provide such compliance in accordance with Clause 5(a) and Clause 5(b) for whatever reason, the data importer agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract the affected parts of the Services in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>c.\nIf the

accordance with the provisions of the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by the data exporter prior to suspension or termination).\nThe data exporter shall not be required to provide such notice in instance where it considers there is a material risk of harm to data subjects or their personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 5(f): Audit</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\nData exporter acknowledges and agrees that it exercises its audit right under Clause 5(f) by instructing data importer to comply with the audit measures described in the

of the data importer to send promptly a copy of any onward subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.</p>\n<p>b.\nThe parties further acknowledge that, pursuant to subprocessor confidentiality restrictions, data importer may be restricted from disclosing onward subprocessor agreements to data exporter.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding this, data importer shall use reasonable efforts to require any subprocessor it appoints to permit it to disclose the subprocessor agreement to data exporter.</p>\n<p>c.\nEven where data importer cannot disclose a subprocessor agreement to data exporter, the parties agree that, upon the request of data exporter, data importer shall (on a confidential basis) provide all information it reasonably requires in connection with such subprocessing agreement to data exporter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clause 6: Liability&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\na.\nAny claims brought under the Clauses shall be subject to the terms and conditions,

versions of select features in our paid products, is one of our free services.\nAs such, there are no Subscription Fees associated with your use of the HubSpot CRM.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While there\u2019s no charge for contacts in the CRM, if you subscribe to Marketing Hub, you will be charged for contacts as part of your fee for that product, even if they are added through the HubSpot CRM.\nIf you use

date of your paid subscription.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.2 Email Send Limit</p>\n<p>For the HubSpot CRM, if you only use our Free Services, the CRM Email Send Limit is equal to a maximum of two-thousand

access to Customer Data after termination or expiration of your subscription.\nIf you want to retain any Customer Data after your Subscription Term ends, we recommend you export that data from your HubSpot account in advance.</p>\n<p>1.7 Unified Database.</p>\n<p>By using HubSpot CRM with other parts of the Subscription Service, you understand that all Contact Information will be stored in a unified database of Contacts associated with your subscription, and that all workflows you use will pull from this unified list of Contacts.\nWhile there\u2019s no charge for Contacts in HubSpot CRM, if you subscribe to our Marketing Hub Professional or Marketing Hub Enterprise products, you will be charged for Contacts as part of your fee for those products, even if they are added through HubSpot CRM and whether or not there is an email address associated with a Contact.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>2.&nbsp.\nMARKETING HUB</strong>\n<br>\n<p>In October 2020, HubSpot introduced a new

which they want to send marketing emails and target ads, and they can store up to one million Non-Marketing Contacts for free.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Marketing Contacts pricing model will be available to all new Marketing Hub customers on October 21, 2020.\nIf you purchase any of our Marketing Contacts Products, the Marketing Hub terms in Section 2.1 below will apply to your

twenty (20) times the Maximum Contacts number per month.\nFor Marketing Hub Professional - Marketing Contacts, the Email Send Limit is equal to ten (10) times the Maximum Contacts number per month.\nFor Marketing Hub Starter - Marketing Contacts, this limit is equal to five (5) times the Maximum Contacts number per calendar month.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you reach your Email Send Limit, you may

Adjustments</p>\n<p>2.1.4.1 Contact Tiers.\nYour Subscription Fee will increase immediately during the course of a Billing Period if you exceed your Maximum Contacts limit in a Billing Period.\nIn this case, the Subscription Fee will increase up to the tier price which corresponds with the number of Marketing Contacts and your invoice will increase by the corresponding prorated amount for the remainder of Subscription Term.\nTier prices for Marketing Contacts Products are as set out in the Product and Services Catalog.\nYou will receive an electronic notification (as described in the Notices section of our Master Terms) if you\u2019re approaching your Marketing Contact tier limit.</p>\n<p>You may manage your Marketing Contacts to avoid an increase in your Subscription Fee as set out in the \u2018Managing Your Marketing Contacts\u2019 section below.</p>\n<p>2.1.4.2&nbsp.\nOther Fee Adjustments.&nbsp.\nFor detail on renewal pricing, see the \u2018Fees\u2019 section of the Master Terms.&nbsp.\nWe may choose to decrease your fees upon written notice to you.</p>\n<p>2.1.5&nbsp.\nManaging Your Marketing Contacts</p>\n<p>When you purchase a Marketing Contacts Product, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to select which contacts you\u2019d like to designate as Marketing Contacts, and which you want to designate as Non-Marketing Contacts.\nWe also recommend reviewing the designation of your Contacts regularly to avoid an unintended Contact tier upgrade fee.\nAll Users have permission to make Contact designations in the portal unless their right to do so is limited by you in the \u2018Users and Teams\u2019 settings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re switching from one of our Marketing Hub Products with legacy contacts pricing to one of our Marketing Contacts Products, all Contacts will be designated Marketing Contacts by default.\nWe strongly recommend you complete the Eligibility Flow tool to designate your Non-Marketing Contacts before you switch to avoid an unintended Contact tier upgrade fee which will apply immediately and cannot be refunded.</p>\n<p>We will monitor or audit remotely the number of Marketing Contacts in the Subscription Service and the number of emails that you send on the Subscription Service.\nThis information is also made available to you in your HubSpot account.</p>\n<p>You can change your Contacts from Non-Marketing to Marketing Contacts at any time.\nWe allow you to designate Marketing Contacts as Non-Marketing\u2019 Contacts at any time, but changes in designations to Non-Marketing will not take effect until the first day of the next month or on your subscription renewal date, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>2.1.6&nbsp.\nLimits</p>\n<p>For all Marketing Contacts Products and paid Add-Ons to those products, we may change the limits that apply to you at any time in our sole discretion by updating the Product and Services Catalog.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please refer to the Product and Service Catalog and your Order

your contacts as Non-Marketing at any time (as described in the \u2018Managing your Marketing Contacts\u2019 section above), but you can only downgrade your contact tier at your next renewal date upon signature of a new Order.\nIn order to avoid additional charges, you should purchase the appropriate tier of Subscription Service for your anticipated needs.</p>\n<p>2.1.8&nbsp.\nModifications</p>\n<p>We will not make changes to the Marketing Hub Professional - Marketing Contacts, Marketing Hub Enterprise - Marketing Contacts and paid Add-Ons to these products that materially reduce the functionality provided to you during the Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>We may make changes to our Marketing Hub Starter - Marketing Contacts product and Add-Ons to that product that materially reduce the functionality provided to you during the Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>2.1.9&nbsp.\nNotice of Non-Renewal</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified in your Order, to prevent renewal of your Marketing Hub with Marketing Contacts subscription or paid Add-Ons to Marketing Hub with Marketing Contacts, you or we must give written notice of non-renewal and this written notice must be received before the next renewal period begins.</p>\n<p>2.1.10&nbsp.\nRetrieval of Customer Data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For Marketing Hub Professional - Marketing Contacts and for Marketing Hub Enterprise - Marketing Contacts, if you make a written request within thirty (30) days after termination or expiration of your subscription, we will provide you with temporary access to the Subscription Service to retrieve, or we will provide you with copies of, all Customer Data then in our possession or control.\nIf we provide you with temporary access to the account, we may charge a re-activation fee.\nThirty (30) days after termination or expiration of your Subscription, we will have no obligation to maintain or provide you the Customer Data.\nWe will delete all Customer Data in our systems or otherwise in our control unless (i) we are legally prohibited or (ii) save as set out in the \u2018Deletion or Return of Personal Data\u2019 section of the DPA, then such Personal Data shall be Processed in accordance with our DPA.</p>\n<p>For Marketing Hub Starter - Marketing Contacts, we will not provide you with any access to Customer Data after termination or expiration of your subscription.\nIf you want to retain any Customer Data after your Subscription Term ends, we recommend you export that data from your HubSpot account in advance.</p>\n<p>2.1.11&nbsp.\nLegacy Marketing Hub Products</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the \u2018Legacy\u2019 section of the HubSpot Master Terms, once you've purchased a Marketing Contacts Product, you cannot choose to re-purchase the Marketing Hub product with legacy contacts pricing, which bills differently for Contacts, even if it's still listed in our Product &amp.\nServices Catalog.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you use one of our other legacy Marketing Hub products that is not listed in the Product Specific Terms, then the terms that apply to Marketing Hub Enterprise with legacy contacts pricing apply to your subscription.</p>\n<p>2.1.12&nbsp.\nBrand Domains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to host multiple root domains associated with your company in a single HubSpot account, you must purchase a subscription to the Marketing Hub Enterprise - Marketing Contacts product with the Brand Domain add-on product.&nbsp.\nA root domain is considered to be a different domain name that immediately precedes the top-level

root domains.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2.\nMarketing Hub (legacy contacts pricing)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The terms in this section 2.2 apply to any purchase of the Marketing Hub Products with legacy contacts

Adjustments' section below.</p>\n<p>2.2.4&nbsp.\nFee Adjustments</p>\n<p>2.2.4.1 Contact Tier</p>\n<p>We determine the Contact tier for the next Billing Period by reviewing the number of Contacts in your account.\nFor Marketing Hub Professional or Marketing Hub Enterprise, we complete this review between forty (40) and twenty-five (25) days before the start of your next Billing Period.&nbsp.\nFor Marketing Hub Starter, we complete this review on the last day of your Billing Period.\nYou may manage your Contacts to avoid an increase in your Subscription Fee as set out in the \u2018Manage Contacts\u2019 section below.</p>\n<p>If the number of Contacts in your account exceed your Maximum Contacts when we complete this review, then your Subscription Fee will increase at the beginning of the next Billing Period up to the tier price which corresponds with the reviewed number of Contacts.\nTier prices are as set out in our Product and Services Catalog.</p>\n<p>For Marketing Hub Starter, upon renewal, your subscription will be adjusted to match the Contact tier that corresponds with the number of Contacts in your portal on the last day of your then-current Subscription

account.</p>\n<p>We allow you to reasonably manage the number of Contacts during the course of a Billing Period and will not count Contacts removed before our review, unless these Contacts are temporarily removed to avoid a fee increase.\nIf Contacts are temporarily removed to avoid a fee increase, we may consider the maximum number of Contacts from the reviewed Billing Period for the
