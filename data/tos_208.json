held in English.\nThis Arbitration Agreement applies to you\nand the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors\nin interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized\nusers or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration\nRules.</strong> Arbitration shall\nbe initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative\ndispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.\nIf AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative\nADR Provider.\nThe rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration\nexcept to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.\nThe AAA Consumer\nArbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by\ncalling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by a single,\nneutral arbitrator.\nAny claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought\nis less than Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding\nnon-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.\nFor\nclaims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the\nArbitration Rules.\nAny hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your\nresidence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the
