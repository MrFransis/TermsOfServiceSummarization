Software Foundation including: fsf.org, gnu.org, ftp.gnu.org, audio-video.gnu.org, libreplanet.org, defectivebydesign.org, playfreedom.org, directory.fsf.org, savannah.gnu.org, and savannah.nongnu.org (collectively \"FSF's sites\").\nIf you believe there is a work or multiple works on one of the FSF's sites that violates copyright law, let us know.\nSpecifically, send us an email or letter that includes substantially the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the holder of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>\n<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.</li>\n<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.</li>\n<li>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>\n<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>The notice should be sent to our designated agent, Donald Robertson, via email (donald@fsf.org) or fax (617-542-2652 x56).</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may display a copy of your DMCA notice in place of the removed work.</p>\n<p>Note: Under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages.\nOne company that sent an infringement notification seeking removal of online materials that were protected by the fair use doctrine was ordered to pay such costs and attorneys fees under this provision.\nSee <em>Online Policy Group v.\nDiebold</em>, http://www.eff.org/cases/online-policy-group-v-diebold for more information.\nIn addition, \u201cin order for a copyright owner to proceed under the DMCA with \u201ca good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law,\u201d the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright.\u201d <em>Lenz v.\nUniversal</em>, 572 F.\nSupp.\n2d 1150, 1155 (2008).</p>\n<p>The Free Software Foundation reserves the right to review the allegedly infringing material and independently determine whether it is infringing.</p>\n<p>Please also note that the information provided in this legal notice will be forwarded to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.\nA copy of this legal notice may also be sent (with your personal information removed) to a third-party that may publish and/or annotate it for noncommercial research and educational purposes.</p> Counter-Notification: What You Can Do If Your Work Was Removed <p>If you believe material you posted to one of the FSF\u2019s sites was not infringing, you can submit a counter-notice.\nIf you need assistance in determining whether the material was not infringing, please contact the Electronic Frontier Foundation (via email at info@eff.org), who may be able to help you find an independent attorney to evaluate your situation.</p>\n<p>A counter-notification must include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identification of the specific URLs of material that FSF has removed or to which FSF has disabled access.</li>\n<li>Your full name, address, telephone number, and email address.</li>\n<li>The statement: \"I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of the United States, the judicial district in which FSF is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant.\" FSF is located in the District of Massachusetts.</li>\n<li>The statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\"</li>\n<li>A scanned physical signature or an electronic signature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Please send your counter-notice to Donald Robertson, via email (donald@fsf.org) or fax (617-542-2652 x56).</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.</p>\n<p>After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement.\nPlease note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes your personal information.\nIf you are concerned about protecting your anonymity, please consult with an attorney about other options.</p>\n<p>After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within 10 business days that the claimant has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on one of FSF\u2019s site.\nIf we receive such notification we will be unable to restore the material.\nIf we do not receive such notification, generally we will reinstate the material.</p>\n<p>Please also be advised that we may terminate the accounts of repeat infringers.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Updated August 25th, 2016</em>\n</p>\n<p>Copyright \u00a9 2012 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>Copyright \u00a9 2012

Published on May 24, 2018 07:22 PM Your trust is important to the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and we take privacy and security very seriously.\nIf you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policy or our use of data, please get in touch with us at privacy@fsf.org, +1-617-542-5942, or by our mailing address: Free Software Foundation, 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335, USA.\n<p>FSF staff, management, and volunteers uphold strict internal policies against unauthorized disclosure or use of personal information.</p>\n<p>\nWe will never share your information with parties outside the\nFSF, unless we have explicitly made you aware that we will before you\ngive it to us.\nWe use services for payment processing, which requires sharing the transaction information with them over a secure connection, under legal agreement that appropriately controls its use and retention.\nWe may establish similar arrangements with other formally contracted service providers, but always use privacy and security as key criteria when selecting them, and only share the data required for the service to function.\nAs an organization with an ideological commitment to self-hosting nearly everything, the number of such providers is and will be very small.\n</p> Analytics\n<p>The FSF uses Piwik, a free software Web analytics system, to monitor traffic on our Web sites.\nPiwik records the general geographical vicinity of visitors as well as their browser and operating system, and records their navigation within the sites.\nThis helps us gauge the impact of our materials and improve our work.</p>\n<p>Piwik preserves privacy by anonymizing visitors' IP addresses.\nThis means that it will not store any personally identifiable information about you, even though your visit produces a record that our site was visited by someone.</p>\n<p>Piwik also respects the \"Do Not Track\" preference offered by some browsers, so if you have this option set, Piwik will ignore your visit.</p>\n<p>If you're not using \"Do Not Track\" and/or you would rather that we don't record your visits with Piwik, you can opt out of tracking on www.fsf.org (but not other domains) by unchecking the box below.\nIf you choose to opt out, the system will set a \"piwik_ignore\" cookie for this domain, which indicates to Piwik that it should completely ignore your computer.</p>\n<br> Information You Make Public <p>The FSF maintains services such as wikis, email discussion lists,\nforums, and software distribution Web sites where users may submit\ninformation to be published publicly.\nYou are creating a permanent,\npublic record of information added, removed, and/or altered by you,\nincluding information which may identify you.\nFor example, emails to\npublic discussion lists are publicly available in their entirety,\nincluding your email address.\nPlease think carefully about your desired\nlevel of anonymity before you disclose personal information.</p> Customer Information <p>All information related to financial transactions and member logins is handled through a secure connection.</p>\n<p>The FSF does not store complete credit card numbers on our servers.\nWe retain only the last 4 digits of the card.</p> Sales <p>Contact information is requested at the time of a sale in order to\ncomplete the sale and deliver the products.&nbsp.\nIt is also used to\nverify the credit card transaction when a credit card is used.\nCustomer\nlists are not sold or distributed to third parties.&nbsp.\nThe Free\nSoftware Foundation uses these customer lists to send occasional\nsolicitations and its biannual newsletter.\nCustomers can opt out of all\ncontact or specify only print or email contact by emailing privacy@fsf.org</p> Donations <p>Contact information is requested at the time of a donation.\nThis\ninformation is used to verify the initial credit card transaction.\nDonor lists are not sold or distributed to third parties.\nThe Free\nSoftware Foundation uses these donor lists to send occasional\nsolicitations and its biannual newsletter.\nDonors can opt out of all\ncontact or specify only print or email contact by emailing privacy@fsf.org.\nDonor names are\nposted on our Thank Gnus\npage as a recognition of their support.\nAt the\ntime of the donation, the donor can ask to be anonymous, so that their\nname will not be publicly recognized.</p> Membership <p>Contact information is requested at the time of a membership sign-up.\nThis information is used to verify the initial credit card transaction\nand future transactions if the member signs up for monthly deductions.\nMember lists are not sold or distributed to third parties.\nThe Free\nSoftware Foundation uses this member list to send a membership packet,\noccasional solicitations, and its biannual newsletter.\nMembers can opt out of receiving the newsletter when they sign up.\nMembers can opt out of all\ncontact or specify only print or email contact by emailing privacy@fsf.org</p> User Registration <p>The Free Software Foundation uses registration lists to send news updates, occasional solicitations and its biannual newsletter.\nYou can be removed by writing to privacy@fsf.org.</p> General Data Protection Regulation <p>The FSF has the right to process personal data of EU residents (i)\ndue to their provided consent to FSF.\nor (ii) in order to conclude an\nagreement with them and to fulfill it.\nThe legal basis for the processing\nof personal data is Article 6 (1) (a)-(b) of the General Data Protection\nRegulation.\nEU residents under the age of 16 should not submit their\npersonal data for subscribing to our email solicitations and we will\ndelete any such data if we become aware of it.\nThe personal data recipients may be data processors who\nprovide ancillary services to the FSF.\nThe FSF will store personal\ndata during the term of the agreement and during the limitation period\nas defined by applicable law or until
