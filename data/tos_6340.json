Services' Sharing Choices6.1.\nFor GuestsTo decline to share Personal Data that is mandatory with our Services, you can choose not to become a Member, and browse our Services as a Guest.\nOur Services do not collect any&nbsp;Personal Data about Guests.\nHowever, our Third Party Services will still collect Personal Data.\nGenerally, Guests have a similar browsing experience to Members, however, Members accrue loyalty benefits over time, such as, for example, the ability to disable Advertisements.<br>\n<br>6.2.\nFor MembersAs a Member, you can decline to share Personal Data that is optional.\nThis will not limit your experience of our Services.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>If you wish to no longer share mandatory Personal Data with our Services (Username and Email), you must end your Membership, at which point you will return to Guest status.<br>\n<br>6.2.1.\nDeleting your Personal DataThis involves several steps:<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the Personal Data you have voluntarily provided across your posts and submissions.</li>\n<li>Erase this Personal Data you have identified that you provided voluntarily, by Editing affected posts and submissions.</li>\n<li>Use the Scrubber tool in your Settings area.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>7.\nOur Services' Storage SystemYour Personal Data is stored centrally and securely in our Services' private, dedicated server cluster, located in the New York Metro Area of the United States.\nYour Personal Data is not transferred and stored outside this environment, nor is it stored with a distributed cloud-based hosting platform.\nBecause we maintain our own private server infrastructure, we have full control over the security and replication of your Personal Data.<br>\n<br>7.1.\nData ReplicationWe replicate your Personal Data for backup purposes, in the event that our servers or hard disks fail, or in the event that through human error your Personal Data is deleted.\nTypically, we maintain 3 copies of your Personal Data on our Backup Server.\nOur Backup Server is located within our private server infrastructure as mentioned above, and is never transferred outside to a separate hosting environment.<br>\n<br>7.2.\nData RetentionWe

is physically guarded 24/7.</li>\n<li>Firewalls - our servers only communicate to one another in specific ways, between specific origins and destinations.</li>\n<li>Network monitoring - we monitor for attacks on Our Services, and protect our Members' accounts by notifying them of suspicious activity.</li>\n<li>TLS encryption - most of Our Services are only accessible via an encrypted

used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>7.4.\nPersonal Data AnonymizationIf you choose to remove your Personal Data from public display, Our Services will still retain some of your Personal Data, <u>accessible by Administrators only</u>.\nYour Personal Data&nbsp;will become anonymized and used to inform our Security Platform.\nThis anonymized Personal Data includes:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Your IP Address</li>\n<li>Your User agent</li>\n</ul>\n<br>Personal Data Anonymization involves severing or scrambling the link between your Personal Data and you as a natural person.\nFor example, when your Username (the primary form of Personal Data that identifies you on Our Services), is scrambled using the Scrubber, no person or system will be able to attribute your existing posts and submissions to you as a natural person.<br>\n<br>7.5.\nStorage MaintenanceFrom time to time, our private servers require maintenance.\nSometimes, they need to be re-purposed, turned off or migrated to other private servers within our private infrastructure.\nWhen this occurs, every effort is made to ensure your Personal Data is not exposed, lost, tampered with or abandoned.<br>\n<br>8.\nThird Party Services &amp.\nYour Personal DataIn order to maintain our Services, we must rely on Third Party Services.\nThese include:<br>\n<br>8.1.\nAdvertising NetworksAdvertising Networks may track you across the Internet in order to better target ads to you.\nWhen you search on Google for example, you
