the\nSharing of Them with Other Members\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nCare.com offers to individuals who have registered as Care Providers and Care Seekers one or more\nbackground check services from third-party consumer reporting agencies (\"Background Checks\").\nCertain\nbackground checks may\nbe made available for purchase by both Care Seekers and Care Providers, while others may only be made\nonly be available for purchase by Care Seekers or Care Providers.\nAll background checks require\npayment of a separate fee by the Member who is initiating the background check request and are subject\nto the consent of the Care Provider on whom the check is being performed.\n</p>\n<p>\nEach of these Background Checks is regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"), and the\nbackground reports resulting from these services are considered \"consumer reports\" under FCRA.\nConsumer reports may contain information on your character, general reputation, personal\ncharacteristics, and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history,\nworkers' compensation, driving, employment, military, civil, and educational data and reports.\n</p>\n<p>\nCare.com will receive a copy of each Background Check you order or authorize through Care.com.\nSee\nSection 4.4 below for information regarding Care.com's use of these Background Checks.\nYou are\nresponsible for making sure that the email address you provide to Care.com is correct, knowing that\nsensitive information will be sent to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIf you are a Care Provider and you authorize a third-party background check ordered by a Care\nSeeker, the results of that background check will be made available to the Care Seeker who ordered\nit, regardless of its contents.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are a Care Provider and you have ordered a Background Check on yourself from a third-party\nconsumer reporting agency through Care.com, we may indicate in your profile that you have completed\nthat check.\nHowever, we will not share the results with any other site visitor or Registered User\nwithout your specific authorization.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2.\nBackground Check Offerings Available to Individuals Who May Not Have Registered As Care\nProviders or Care Seekers </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThrough certain pages of the Site, we may from time to time offer to individuals who may or may not be\nregistered as Care Seekers the opportunity to purchase certain background checks on caregivers who are\nnot necessarily registered on Care.com.\nThese background checks are performed by a third-party\nconsumer reporting agency and are subject to the terms of Section 4.1, 4.3, and 4.7 except that (i)\nreferences to Care Seekers shall refer to individuals who order the checks regardless of whether they\nare registered as Care Seekers, (ii) references to Care Providers shall refer to individuals who\nauthorize the check to be performed on themselves regardless of whether they are registered as Care\nProviders, and (iii) Care.com does not view the results of these checks regardless of whether the\ncaregiver on whom the check is performed is registered as a Care Provider.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>4.3.\nSpecial Responsibilities of Users of Background Check under FCRA </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe use of any background check reports obtained through the Site is governed by the federal Fair\nCredit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\") and certain state laws.\nIf you order or request access to background\ncheck on a Care Seeker, you are considered an end user of the check, and must agree to a required End\nUser Certification before the check will be processed.\nThis End User Certification requires you to\ncertify that you will comply with the FCRA and any applicable state laws, and summarizes key legal\nobligations.\nA summary of your responsibilities in using the information contained the background\ncheck can be found http://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know.\nIf there is negative data in a check you receive, and you choose to take \"adverse action\" (i.e.\nif you\nchoose to pass on that individual's candidacy) on the basis of this negative data, you must agree to\ntake certain procedural steps, which can be found at http://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know.\nThese include notifying the individual who is the subject of the report of your decision to take\nadverse action based on information contained in the report and the subject's right to contest the\naccuracy or completeness of the report.\nDepending on the specific background check you order, Care.com\nmay provide a mechanism for you to request that the consumer reporting agency who performed the check\ncomplete these steps on your behalf.\nWhere such a mechanism is not available, you are responsible for\nmaking any required notifications yourself.\nIf the subject contests the report with the consumer\nreporting agency, you are required to suspend the hiring process while the agency researches the\naccuracy and completeness of the report.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>4.4 Care.com May Review and Use Background Checks You Order or Authorize

Verification Checks </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>SPECIAL NOTICE FOR MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW HAMPSHIRE:</b> Criminal County Searches conducted in\nMassachusetts and New Hampshire as part of the Criminal Records Check and the Criminal+MVR Records\nCheck (for individuals who are believed to have lived in one or both of these states during the seven\nyears preceding the background check request) search only the Superior Court and a single District\nCourt in the county seat or its equivalent for each county listed below.\nCriminal records (including\nmisdemeanors and felonies) from other courts in these states will not be searched.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is an illustrative, non-comprehensive, list of certain state and county limitations of the\nbackground checks offered through Care.com.\nadditional limitations may apply in certain jurisdictions,\nincluding on the federal level.\nFor example, for many states only certain registered sex offender\ninformation is reported, and for many states, only a subset of felony convictions are reported (and\nnot any misdemeanors, charges or arrest records).\n</p>\n<p>\nIn addition to legal and reporting system limitations of background checks, each check is performed\nwith the authorization of the person being checked, using information he or she provides, such as home\naddress, social security number, date of birth, and name.\nIf a candidate provides incorrect\ninformation, the check might be run with inaccurate identifying data, which can impact the validity of\nthe criminal check.\nFinally, criminal records are not always reported accurately or promptly, and\nhuman and electronic error can result in inaccurate or incomplete reporting.\nConsequently, even the\nmost comprehensive background check offered may not disclose the existence of all criminal records in\nall jurisdictions.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you decide to access, use, or share information provided by a Background Check, you agree to do so\nin accordance with applicable law.\nYou also agree to release, indemnify and hold harmless Care.com\nfrom any loss, liability, injury, death, damage, or costs that may result from your use of, reliance\non, or sharing of the information contained in a Background Check regardless of the cause, including,\nwithout limitation, due to the inaccuracy or incompleteness of any such information.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou expressly acknowledge that Care.com has no obligation to perform Background Checks, Internal\nBackground Checks, or Verification Checks on any Registered Users.\nTo the extent Care.com performs\nsuch checks on certain

Arbitrate\n<p>\nThis Section 13 is referred to in these Terms as the \"Arbitration Agreement\".\nUnless you opt-out in\naccordance with the opt-out procedures set forth in Section 13.8 below, you agree that all claims\nrelating to or arising out of these Terms or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort,\nor otherwise that have arisen or may arise between you and Care.com or a Care.com Affiliate, whether\nrelating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, the Site, or otherwise,\nshall be resolved exclusively through <strong>final and binding arbitration, rather than a\ncourt,</strong> in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except you may assert\nindividual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.\nYour rights will be determined by a\n<strong>neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury</strong>.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the\ninterpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n13.2 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\n<p>\n<strong>\nYOU AND CARE.COM AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL\nBASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION,\nACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND CARE.COM EXPRESSLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT\nCONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS AGAINST CARE.COM AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE\nPRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR\nMAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE\nINDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY\nTHAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).\nANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER CARE.COM USERS.\n</strong>\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void\nor unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the\narbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties\nshall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n13.3 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution\n<p>\nCare.com is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently.\nSo before you commence\narbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your complaint, as we may be able to resolve it\nwithout the need for arbitration.\nYou may contact us at Care.com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department,\n1501 S Mopac Expwy, Barton Skyway One, Suite 340, Austin, TX 78746.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n13.4 Arbitration Procedures\n<p>\nIf we cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim either of us asserts will be resolved <strong>only\nby binding arbitration and not in courts of general jurisdiction</strong>.\nArbitration will be\nconducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time\nthe arbitration is initiated (collectively referred to as the \"JAMS Rules\"), as modified by this\nArbitration Agreement, and excluding the JAMS Class Action Procedures.\nFor information on JAMS, please\nvisit its website, https://www.jamsadr.com/.\nInformation about JAMS's Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the JAMS consumer\narbitration page, https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.\nIf there is any inconsistency between the JAMS Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this\nArbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the\ninconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.\nThe\narbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would, including without\nlimitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 11.\nAlthough arbitration proceedings are\nusually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can\naward the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under\nthe Terms and applicable law.\nDecisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be\noverturned by a court only for very limited reasons.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo commence an arbitration against Care.com, you must write a demand for arbitration that includes a\ndescription of the dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.\nYou can find a copy of a\nDemand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com.\nYou\nshould send three copies of the Demand, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS at 500 North State\nCollege Blvd., Suite 600, Orange, CA 92868, and send one copy to Care.com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department,\n1501 S Mopac Expwy, Barton Skyway One, Suite 340, Austin, TX 78746.\nFor more information, see\nthe JAMS arbitration rules and forms, https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-download/.\nYou may\nrepresent yourself in the arbitration or be represented by an attorney or another representative.\nOnce\nwe receive your arbitration claim, we may assert any counterclaims we may have against you.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed\nlocation.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less you or Care.com may elect to have the\narbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be\nbinding on you and Care.com subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if\nthe circumstances warrant.\nAttendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or\nCare.com, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to\nresolve all claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether\nsounding in contract, tort, or otherwise and all disputes arising out of or relating to the\ninterpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited\nto any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject\nto arbitration.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a\ncourt under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator's award shall be written, and binding on the parties and\nmay be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of\nDelaware, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized\nby law.\nThe arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different\nCare.com users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Care.com user to the\nextent required by applicable law.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n13.5 Costs of Arbitration\n<p>\nPayment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the \"Arbitration Fees\") will\nbe governed by the JAMS Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf you\ndemonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration\nFees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay\nyour portion of the Arbitration Fees, Care.com will pay your portion of such fees.\nIn addition, if you\ndemonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the\ncosts of litigation, Care.com will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems\nnecessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.\nEach party will be responsible for\nall other fees it incurs in connection with the arbitration, including without limitation, all\nattorney fees.\nIn the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be\nfrivolous, you agree to reimburse Care.com for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by\nCare.com on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the JAMS rules.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n13.6 Confidentiality <p>\nAll aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will\nbe strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n13.7 Opt-Out Procedure <p>\nYou can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice (\"Opt-Out\nNotice\") in accordance with the terms of this Section.\nFor new Care.com users, the Opt-Out Notice must\nbe postmarked no later than 30 Days after the date you use our Site or Services for the first time.\nIf\nyou are already a current Care.com user and previously accepted the Care.com Terms prior to the\nintroduction of this Arbitration Agreement, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than\nJanuary 17, 2017.\nYou must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Care.com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department,\n1501 S Mopac Expwy, Barton Skyway One, Suite 340, Austin, TX 78746.\nThe Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to\nthe Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es)\nused to log in to the Care.com account(s) to which the opt-out applies.\nYou must sign the Opt-Out\nNotice for it to be effective.\nThis procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Arbitration\nAgreement.\nIf you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Care.com will likewise not be bound by these\narbitration provisions.\nAll other terms of these Terms will continue to apply.\nOpting out of the\nArbitration Agreement has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you\nmay have with us.\nCare.com users who accepted a previous version of these Terms that included an\narbitration agreement, and who did not timely opt out of that arbitration agreement, remain bound by\nthe last arbitration agreement that they accepted.\nUpon receipt of a valid Opt-Out Notice, Care.com\nwill provide the opting out user with a copy of the arbitration agreement from the last version of the\nTerms that the user accepted, if any exists.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n13.8 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement <p>\nNotwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any\nchange to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to any notice address or website link\nprovided herein) in the future, such change shall not be effective until at least 60 days from the\ndate of posting, and shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against\nCare.com prior to the effective date of the change.\nMoreover, if we seek to terminate this Arbitration\nAgreement from these Terms, such termination shall not be effective until 30 days after the version of\nthese Terms not containing the Arbitration Agreement is posted to the Site, and shall not be effective\nas to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Care.com prior to the effective date of\nremoval.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Governing Law and Jurisdiction <p>\nThese Terms, and all claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether\nsounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,\nincluding Delaware's statutes of limitations governing your claim, without giving effect to its principles\nof conflicts of law, provided that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the
