else in addition to MuseScore), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that MuseScore is not required to pay you or anyone else deriving rights from you for the use on the Service of the User Generated Content that you post), sublicensable (so that MuseScore is able to use its affiliates, subcontractors and other partners such as Internet content delivery networks and wireless carriers to provide
