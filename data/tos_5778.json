through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.\nSome cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service.\nThere are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\n<i>Session Cookies</i>\n</b>.\nSession cookies exist only during an online session.\nThey disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.\nWe use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site.\nThis allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</p>\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>\n<i>Persistent Cookies</i>\n</b>.\nPersistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or

you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.\nThe Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.\nVisitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Storage Objects<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (\u201cFlash
