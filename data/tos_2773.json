party resulting from the closing down.</p>\n<p>5.8 If the user does not act in accordance with the provisions above, GOOSE will be entitled to impose instructions on the user.\nThe user will be obliged to follow these.\nAny financial consequences will be at the user\u2019s expense.\nIf this situation occurs the user cannot make claim to any refund.</p>\n<p>5.9 GOOSE has the right to take all measures that are necessary to protect its network, its users and third parties, against impermissible conduct \u2013 in whatsoever form \u2013 on the part of specific users.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Article 6 Availability and fair use policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>6.1 GOOSE arranges the service as it deems most suitable.\nGOOSE will be entitled to change procedures and the technical aspects of the service.</p>\n<p>6.2 GOOSE makes endeavours to be of service to its users in the best possible manner in the field of speed, availability, security and usability.\nHowever, GOOSE cannot guarantee this due to inter alia breakdowns, necessary maintenance and adjustments of the system for improvement.</p>\n<p>6.3 GOOSE does not apply a strict bandwidth limitation in its most extensive subscription.\nHowever, a fair use policy does apply.\nUsers, who use more than 1% of the entire bandwidth of the GOOSE network, will be approached by GOOSE to reduce the use, or to make a higher payment.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Article 7 Rates and payment</strong>\n</p>\n<p>7.1 Goose charges a payment for the use of the service in accordance with the rates published in GOOSE\u2019s website.</p>\n<p>7.2 All rates referred to on the website are including VAT and any other duties or taxes imposed by authorities.</p>\n<p>7.3 If the agreement is converted into an agreement for an indefinite period the collection of the payment will take place by means of direct debit collection.</p>\n<p>7.4 The collection will take place prior to the provision of the service.</p>\n<p>7.5 It is assumed for the recording of the amount of the collection that the user continues with his/her choice of package, unless the user has notified otherwise.</p>\n<p>7.6 GOOSE will in advance notify the date on which the direct debit collection will take place by means of an electronic message or an invoice.</p>\n<p>7.7 The user will be in default without further notice of default if the direct debit collection cannot take place.\nGOOSE will forward a payment reminder to the user whereby the user will be provided with the opportunity to pay within 14 days.</p>\n<p>7.8 The user will owe default interest from the date of the default at the statutory interest rate applicable at that time.\nThe user will be obliged to pay any judicial and extrajudicial costs to GOOSE.</p>\n<p>7.9 If GOOSE at any time has doubts regarding the user\u2019s creditworthiness, GOOSE will have the right to demand specific security, such as a security deposit or bank guarantee.</p>\n<p>7.10 The user must make objections against the amount of the collection apparent within 30 days.\nThe user will be deemed to agree to the amount of the collection after this period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Article 8 Force Majeure</strong>\n</p>\n<p>8.1 If GOOSE, due to a non-attributable failure (force majeure) cannot fulfil its obligations, the fulfilment of these obligations will be suspended for the duration of the force majeure.</p>\n<p>8.2 A failure in the provision of service cannot be attributed to GOOSE if this cannot be blamed on fault on its part, or a cause for which GOOSE is not accountable by law, by legal act or according to generally accepted standards.\nThese circumstances also include, but are not limited to: power failures, war, environmental disasters, breakdowns of the internet connection, breakdowns in the telecommunication infrastructure, breakdowns of networks, failures on the part of engaged third parties, or suppliers, strike actions and business closures.</p>\n<p>8.3 In the event of force majeure the obligation on the part of GOOSE of fulfilment of the agreement will lapse.\nIn that event GOOSE will not owe any compensation.\nGOOSE will be exclusively obliged for a consumer-user to provide refund of the subscription fee pro rata the duration of the breakdown, unless this cannot be required of it in all reasonableness, with due regard to the duration and the circumstances.</p>\n<p>8.4 If the force majeure lasts for more than four weeks, both parties will have the right to terminate the agreement wholly or in part, insofar as this is justified by the force majeure.\nThe user will not have the right to any compensation in the event of force majeure on the part of GOOSE.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Article 9 Default and termination</strong>\n</p>\n<p>9.1 In the event of default on the part of the user, or in one of the cases below under article 9.4 all GOOSE\u2019s claims against the user, on whatsoever basis, will be immediately due and payable in full, and GOOSE will be entitled to suspend the provision of the service.\nThe above will not affect any of GOOSE\u2019s other rights on the basis of the law or the agreement.</p>\n<p>9.2 If the user is in default GOOSE will provide the service again if the user still fulfils the obligations within the period set out by GOOSE.\nThe user will owe the costs for this recommencing of the service.</p>\n<p>9.3 GOOSE as well as the user can terminate the agreement if the other party does not properly fulfil one or more of the other party\u2019s obligations on the basis of the agreement, insofar as this failure justifies the termination.\nIf fulfilment is still possible the agreement can only be terminated after the other party has been given demand in writing and the failure is not eliminated within the period stated thereby.</p>\n<p>9.4 In the event of (provisional) moratorium, bankruptcy, cessation, or liquidation of (the business of) the user, or if the user is or has become legally incompetent, is placed under a regime of administration, or in any other manner whatsoever loses the free disposition over his/her assets, the agreement will be terminated by operation of law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Article 10 Complaints</strong>\n</p>\n<p>10.1 Complaints regarding defects/breakdowns in the service must be reported to GOOSE electronically or by telephone as soon as possible after the discovery thereof.\nThe user will be obliged, after noticing any breakdown, to do, and to refrain from, anything that is reasonably possible for the prevention of damage.\nThe user will provide all cooperation necessary for the inspection and the solution of the compliant, inter alia by providing GOOSE with the opportunity to conduct an inspection of the circumstances of the use of the service and the factors related thereto.</p>\n<p>10.2 If the user makes a complaint regarding defects in the service correctly, justifiably and in a timely manner, GOOSE will make endeavours to resolve the defect as soon as possible.\nGOOSE will state, if possible, when the defect has presumably been solved.\nIf the user does not make a compliant in a timely manner the user will loss his/her rights.</p>\n<p>10.3 The costs of the breakdown inspection and the costs for eliminating the breakdown will be at GOOSE\u2019s expense.\nIf the breakdown is the result of an attributable failure on the part of the user, GOOSE can charge on these costs to the user.</p>\n<p>10.4 GOOSE will not be obliged to any payment (of compensation) if GOOSE has fulfilled the obligation included in this article.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Article 11 Liability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>11.1 GOOSE will not be liable for any consequential loss, which the user or a third party might suffer due to the use of the service.\nThis also includes, but is not limited to: trading loss, lost profits, loss or theft of data, intangible loss, unauthorised access to confidential information.\nConsequential loss is also loss or damage related to, or resulting from, interruptions or blocking of the access to GOOSE\u2019s network, the internet of GOOSE or third parties, a defect in the security of the information stored by the user, acts on the part of other users, or other internet users, and lastly, changes in login procedures and account data.</p>\n<p>11.2 In any event the contractual and legal liability on the part of GOOSE towards the user, non-consumer, will be at all times limited to the payments excluding VAT actually made by the user to GOOSE during the ongoing contract year, which will be with a maximum of EURO 100 per incident, whereby a related series of incidents will apply as one single incident.</p>\n<p>11.3 GOOSE will only be liable towards the user per incident to a maximum of the (annual) subscription owed by the user to GOOSE.\nGOOSE will only be liable towards one and the same user per year to a maximum of twice the (annual) subscription owed by the user to GOOSE.</p>\n<p>11.4 If several users are affected at the same time by damage caused by GOOSE, GOOSE will be liable in that case towards all users jointly up to a maximum amount of EURO 500.</p>\n<p>11.5 Damage must be reported as soon as possible to GOOSE in writing or electronically, but no later than within four weeks after the arising thereof.\nDamage that has not been brought to the attention of GOOSE within this period will not be eligible for compensation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Article 12 Indemnification by the user</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The user indemnifies GOOSE against claims by third parties for compensation of damage, which these third parties could (attempt to) recover from GOOSE in any manner whatsoever, due to the fact that use has been made of GOOSE\u2019s service, or as the case may be due to the user not having fulfilled the user\u2019s obligations towards GOOSE.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Article 13 Intellectual property</strong>\n</p>\n<p>13.1 The user exclusively acquires a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to use GOOSE\u2019s service together with the documentation and software forming part thereof.\nAll intellectual property rights thereto are vested in GOOSE and/or its suppliers.</p>\n<p>13.2 Copying the documentation for normal personal use and backup purposes is permitted.\nWhen making copies all references determining the ownership and origin must remain unaltered.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Artikel 14 Contract takeover</strong>\n</p>\n<p>14.1 The user will not be entitled to transfer rights and obligations under the agreement to a third party without permission in writing from GOOSE.\nConditions can be attached to this permission.</p>\n<p>14.2 GOOSE will be entitled to transfer its rights and obligations under the agreement to a third party, if this takes place in the context of the transfer of (a part of) the enterprise run by GOOSE.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Article 15 Time limit</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All causes of action ensuing for the user, who is not a consumer, on the basis of this agreement will lapse by means of the expiry of two years, to be calculated from the day following the day on which the claim has become due and payable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Article 16 Applicable law and disputes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>16.1 The law of the Netherlands applies to these Terms and Conditions as well as to the agreement.</p>\n<p>16.2 The applicability of the Vienna Sales Convention 1980 is expressly excluded.</p>\n<p>16.3 If the user and GOOSE are in a dispute in the course of which it is not feasible to reach a mutually satisfactory solution the dispute will be made pending before the court with competent jurisdiction in Rotterdam.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contact</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Business name:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>GOOSE VPN<br>\nPart of GOOSE B.V.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Business address :</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Zirkoon
