Digital, Data and Technology </li>\n</ul> IT Acceptable Use Policy <p>What you may and may not do when you use the University's IT systems, and the consequences of breaking the rules.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Policy</li>\n<li> View more corporate information in Digital, Data and Technology </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This policy has been approved by the Executive Committee and any amendments to it require the Committee's approval.</p> Introduction <p>It is the responsibility of all users of the University of Bath\u2019s I.T.\nservices to read and understand this policy.\nThis policy may be updated from time to time, in order to comply with legal and policy requirements.</p> 1.1 Purpose <p>This Acceptable Use Policy is intended to provide a framework for such use of the University's I.T.\nresources.\nIt should be interpreted such that it has the widest application and so as to include new and developing technologies and uses, which may not be explicitly referred to.</p> 1.2 Policy <p>This Acceptable Use Policy is taken to include the JANET Acceptable Use Policy and the JANET Security Policy published by JANET (UK), the Combined Higher Education Software Team (CHEST) User Obligations, together with its associated Copyright Acknowledgement, and the Eduserv General Terms of Service.\nThe University also has a statutory duty, under Section 26 of the Counter Terrorism and Security Act 2015, termed \u201cPREVENT\u201d.\nThe purpose of this duty is to aid the process of preventing people from being drawn into terrorism.</p> 1.3 Scope <p>Members of the University and all other users (staff, students, visitors, contractors and others) of the University's facilities are bound by the provisions of its policies in addition to this Acceptable Use Policy.\nThe University of Bath seeks to promote and facilitate the positive and extensive use of Information Technology in the interests of supporting the delivery of learning, teaching, innovation and research to the highest possible standards.\nThis also requires appropriate and legal use of the technologies and facilities made available to students, staff and partners of the University.</p> 2 Unacceptable Use <p>a) Subject to exemptions defined in 2f), the University Network may not be used directly or indirectly by a User for the download, creation, manipulation, transmission or storage of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>any offensive, obscene or indecent images, data or other material, or any data capable of being resolved into obscene or indecent images or material;</li>\n<li>unlawful material or material that is defamatory, threatening, discriminatory, extremist or which has the potential to radicalise themselves or others;</li>\n<li>unsolicited \u201cnuisance\u201d emails;</li>\n<li>material which is subsequently used to facilitate harassment, bullying and/or victimisation of a member of the University or a third party;</li>\n<li>material which promotes discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation;</li>\n<li>material with the intent to defraud or which is likely to deceive a third party;</li>\n<li>material which advocates or promotes any unlawful act;</li>\n<li>material that infringes the intellectual property rights or privacy rights of a third party, or that is in breach of a legal duty owed to another party.\nor</li>\n<li>material that brings the University into disrepute.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>b) The University Network must not be deliberately used by a User for activities having, or likely to have, any of the following characteristics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>intentionally wasting staff effort or other University resources;</li>\n<li>corrupting, altering or destroying another User\u2019s data without their consent;</li>\n<li>disrupting the work of other Users or the correct functioning of the University Network.\nor</li>\n<li>denying access to the University Network and its services to other users.</li>\n<li>pursuance of commercial activities (even if in support of university business), subject to a range of exceptions.\nContact DDaT to discuss your commercial need.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>c) Any breach of industry good practice that is likely to damage the reputation of the JANET network will also be regarded prima facie as unacceptable use of the University Network.</p>\n<p>d) Where the University Network is being used to access another network, any abuse of the acceptable use policy of that network will be regarded as unacceptable use of the University Network.</p>\n<p>e) Users shall not:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>introduce data-interception, password-detecting or similar software or devices to the University\u2019s Network;</li>\n<li>seek to gain unauthorised access to restricted areas of the University\u2019s Network;</li>\n<li>access or try to access data where the user knows or ought to know that they should have no access;</li>\n<li>carry out any hacking activities.\nor</li>\n<li>intentionally or recklessly introduce any form of spyware, computer virus or other potentially malicious software.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>f) Exemptions from Unacceptable Use:\nThere are a number of legitimate academic activities that may be carried out using University information systems that could be considered unacceptable use, as defined at 2a-e.\nFor example, research involving defamatory, discriminatory or threatening material, the use of images which may depict violence, the study of hate crime, terrorism-related material or research into computer intrusion techniques.\nIn such circumstances, advice should be sought from the University\u2019s Legal Office (if potentially illegal material is involved) and/or notification made to the University Secretary via the procedure outlined in the University\u2019s Prevent Policy if the material relates to the promotion of extremism/terrorism prior to the introduction of said material onto the University network.</p>\n<p>Any potential research involving obscene or indecent material must always be discussed in advance with the University\u2019s Legal Office.\nIf a member of the University community believes they may have encountered breaches of any of the above, they should make this known to an appropriate University authority (such as the University Secretary, Director of HR, Director of DDaT or Head of Security Services).</p> 3 Consequences of Breach <p>In the event of a breach of this Acceptable Use Policy by a User the University may in its sole discretion:</p>\n<p>a) restrict or terminate a User\u2019s right to use the University Network;</p>\n<p>b) withdraw or remove any material uploaded by that User in contravention of this Policy.\nor</p>\n<p>c) where appropriate, disclose information to law enforcement agencies and take any legal action against a User for breach of this Policy, including but not limited to claiming all costs, fees and disbursements (including but not limited to legal fees) connected therewith.</p>\n<p>In addition, where the User is also a member of the University community, the University may take such action, disciplinary or otherwise as it deems appropriate and which is in accordance with its Charter, Statute, Ordinances and Regulations.</p> 4 Other notes <p>Students are additionally reminded of Regulations for Students, particularly

notification</li>\n</ul> Enquiries <p> dataprotection-queries@lists.bath.ac.uk </p> Data Protection Act <p>These pages outline the General Data Protection Regime that applies in the UK.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been tailored and incorporated into UK legislation by the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>\n<p>The Data Protection Act 2018 (\"the Act\") applies to 'personal data', which is information which relates to individuals.\nIt gives individuals the right to access their own personal data through subject access requests and contains rules which must be followed when personal data is processed.</p>\n<p>The Act works in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it provides individuals with rights, including the right to know what information is held about them and the right to access that information.\n</li>\n<li>it states that anyone who processes personal information must comply with the principles in the Act.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You should assume that any personal data relating to an identifiable living individual, held by the University, in any form, are covered by the Data Protection Act.</p>\n<p>If you have access to personal data you must familiarise yourself with, and comply with, the following University resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Protection Policy</li>\n<li>Data Protection guidance</li>\n<li>Data Security information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are going to be working remotely or using a mobile device please also see data security off-campus.</p> Data covered by the Act <p>The Data Protection Act covers the processing of all 'Personal Data'.\nThis is data which constitutes information relating to a living individual, (a 'Data Subject') and from which (either on its own or together with other information held) the individual is identifiable, so data held purely in an anonymised form is not covered.</p>\n<p>The Data Protection Act covers data held electronically and in hard copy, regardless of where data is held.\nIt covers data held on and off campus, and on employees' or students' mobile devices, so long as it is held for University purposes, regardless of the ownership of the device on which it is stored.</p> Data processing <p>'Processing' is widely defined and includes every possible form of action that can be taken in relation to data including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>obtaining data</li>\n<li>recording data</li>\n<li>keeping data</li>\n<li>using data in any way</li>\n<li>sharing or disclosing data</li>\n<li>erasing and/or destroying data.</li>\n</ul> Lawful basis for processing personal data <p>The University must have a valid lawful basis in order to process personal data and, in most cases, will also need to be satisfied that it is \u2018necessary\u2019 to process personal data to achieve the relevant purpose.</p>\n<p>There are only six potential lawful bases for processing personal data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Public task \u2013 this applies when the processing is necessary for the University to perform a task in the public interest or as part of its official functions.</li>\n<li>Legitimate interests - this applies when the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of the University or a third party, (unless there is a good reason to protect the individual\u2019s personal data which overrides those legitimate interests).</li>\n<li>Contract \u2013 this applies when the processing is necessary for a contract the University has with the individual, (any processing of personal data under this category must be targeted and proportionate).</li>\n<li>Legal obligation \u2013 this applies when the processing is necessary for the University to comply with the law.\nThis can relate to legal, regulatory and other compliance obligations, as well as matters such as the prevention or detection of crime.</li>\n<li>Vital interests \u2013 the processing is necessary to protect the vital interest of someone, normally this means to protect their life.\n</li>\n<li>Consent \u2013 the individual has freely given clear, informed consent for the University to process their personal data (this will always be for a specific purpose).</li>\n</ol> Additional conditions for special category data <p>Special Category Data (which used to be called 'Sensitive Personal Data') are personal data that is more sensitive and needs more protection.\nIn order to lawfully process any such special category data, in addition to having a lawful basis for its processing, the University will need an additional condition for processing.</p>\n<p>There are ten such potential additional conditions which permit Special Category Data to be processed.\nThe most relevant in the context of the University are set out below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The individual has given explicit consent to processing for one or more specified purposes.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Processing is necessary in relation to employment, social security and social protection law;<br>\n</li>\n<li>Processing is necessary to - - protect the vital interests of a person, where they are physically or legally incapable of giving consent.\n</li>\n<li>Processing relates to personal data which is already in the public domain.\n</li>\n<li>Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity.\n</li>\n<li>Processing is necessary for preventive or occupational medicine, for example, assessment the working capacity of an employee and providing health or social case.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further information about the legal basis for processing personal data and the conditions for processing special categories of data can be found on the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office\u2019s website.</p> Six legal principles of Data Protection <p>The Data Protection Act sets out the six legal principles with which the University must comply whenever it processes personal data.\nThese stipulate that the data must:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1 'Be processed fairly, lawfully and transparently'</strong>\nIn order for us to process data 'fairly', we should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ensure that we have a lawful reason to obtain or process the data</li>\n<li>the Data Subject must never be deceived or misled - they must normally have a clear understanding of the reasons for which it is proposed that their data be used</li>\n<li>care needs to be taken to ensure that personal data is only ever obtained from a person who is legally authorised to supply it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>2 'Be processed only for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes'</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The main issues raised by the principle are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all personal data which is processed by the University must be covered by our registration with the Information Commissioner.\nMost routine uses of personal data by staff will be covered by our registration.\nHowever, if you are processing any data (for example, maintaining a database or running a research project involving the use of personal data) and think it may involve us handling new personal data for the first time or using personal data for a new purpose, please email the Data Protection team at dataprotection-queries@lists.bath.ac.uk for advice.</li>\n<li>personal data held for one purpose should not be used for another</li>\n<li>personal data must not be disclosed to any third person (other than those described in the University's registration in certain circumstances), so take great care when you receive a request for data from a third party (see guidance on disclosing data).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>3 ' Be adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are held'</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To ensure compliance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you should not collect any personal data not strictly necessary for the specified purpose.\nIf you are obtaining or holding any special category data take special care to properly consider its necessity</li>\n<li>records should also be unambiguous, accurate and professionally worded.\nAbbreviations should be widely agreed.\nOpinions should be clearly distinguishable from facts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>4 'Be accurate and, where necessary, be kept up to date'</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Personal data must not be inaccurate or misleading to any matter of fact.\nThis applies to information from a third party.\nThe source of information should always be included on records.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5 'Be kept for no longer than is necessary for the specified purpose'</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As the University needs to hold and process personal data for a variety of different legitimate reasons, it is not always possible to stipulate how long particular data should be retained.</p>\n<p>The university has a set of policies on the retention and disposal of different types of records.\nFor other types of data, it is often necessary to decide on a case-by-case basis when they should be destroyed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6 'Be processed in a secure manner, taking appropriate security measures with regard to rights of accidental or unauthorised access to personal data, or accidental or unauthorised destruction, lose, use modification or disclosure of personal data'</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Access to personal data will only be granted to staff insofar as is necessary for legitimate operational purposes.\nThe personal or private use of personal data held by the university is strictly forbidden.</p>\n<p>All staff with access to personal data must be mindful that they play a role in ensuring that it is always kept securely.\nThey must familiarize themselves with the University's Data Protection Policy and follow our guidance on data security.</p> Data Protection Policy <p>The University is committed to protecting the rights and freedoms of all individuals in relation to the processing of their personal data and provides the Data Protection Policy for everyone to follow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Scope of this policy</li>\n<li>Definitions <ul>\n<li>Personal data</li>\n<li>Special category data</li>\n<li>Confidential data</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Legal Framework</li>\n<li>Responsibilities of staff and students <ul>\n<li>Personal Data in the public domain</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lawful basis for processing personal data</li>\n<li>Addition conditions for Special Category Data</li>\n<li>Data Protection Act Principles</li>\n<li>Data Security <ul>\n<li>Keeping personal data secure</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Prohibited activities</li>\n<li>Right to access information</li>\n<li>Research - special considerations</li>\n<li>Implications of breaching this policy</li>\n<li>Conclusion</li>\n</ul> The Scope of this Policy <p>We need to comply with the Data Protection Act (as amended from time to time) in relation to all personal data that is processed by the University.\nTo ensure this happens, it has developed this policy which sets out the obligations of staff in this respect.</p>\n<p>This policy and the Data Protection Act apply to all personal data handled by the University, both that held in paper files and data held electronically.\nSo long as the processing of the data is carried out for University purposes, it also applies regardless of where data is held, (for example, it covers data held on campus and on mobile devices such as electronic notebooks or laptops) and regardless of who owns the PC/device on which it is stored.</p>\n<p>'Processing' data is widely defined and includes every plausible form of action that could be taken in relation to the data such as obtaining, recording and keeping, or using it in any way.\nsharing or disclosing it.\nerasing and destroying it.</p> Definitions Personal data <p>Data which relates to a living individual who can be identified from that data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller.\nThe University is the data controller.</p>\n<p>Examples of personal data are the name and address of an individual or a student ID number which when put with other information held by the university could identify a student, staff member or participant in a researcher's survey.\nThe majority of staff (including all line managers) will, therefore, handle personal data at least occasionally.</p> Special Category Data (previously called Sensitive Personal Data) <p>Some personal data are more sensitive in nature and therefore requires a higher level of protection.\nThe legislation refers to the processing of certain data as \u2018special categories of personal data\u2019.\nThis means personal data about an individual\u2019s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>race or ethnic origin of the data subject</li>\n<li>their political opinions</li>\n<li>their religious beliefs or philosophical beliefs</li>\n<li>whether they are a member of a trade union</li>\n<li>their physical or mental health or condition</li>\n<li>their sexual life</li>\n<li>sexual orientation</li>\n<li>biometric data (where this is used for identification purposes)</li>\n<li>any commission or alleged commission by them of any offence</li>\n<li>any proceedings for any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by them, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Staff working in certain research areas (e.g.\nPsychology/Health), or in certain roles (e.g.\nStudent Disability Advice Service, HR, SREO) will have regular access to special category data, others are likely to do so only rarely if at all.</p> Confidential data <p>Data given in confidence or data agreed to be kept confidential (in other words, a secret between two parties) and that is not in the public domain.</p>\n<p>Some confidential data will also be personal data and/or sensitive personal data and therefore come within the terms of this policy.\nStaff working in certain functions and in senior management roles will handle confidential data regularly.</p>\n<p>The University also handles research data which comprises materials collected or created for the purposes of analysis to generate original research results.\nSome research data will contain personal data and/or sensitive personal data and in all such cases, the provisions of this policy apply.\nFor information on how to deal with other aspects of research data see Research Data Management.</p> Legal Framework <p>The University needs to collect and keep certain types of information about the people with whom it deals.\nThis includes information relating to its staff, students and other individuals.\nIt needs to process 'personal data' for a variety of reasons, such as to recruit and pay its staff, to record the academic progress of its students and to comply with statutory obligations (for example, health and safety requirements).</p>\n<p>The Data Protection Act applies to all 'personal data' processed by the University and to comply with the law all personal data must be collected and used fairly, stored safely and not disclosed to anyone else unlawfully.</p> Responsibilities of staff and students <p>All staff and students must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be mindful of the fact that individuals have the right to see their 'personal data' (and this may include for example information received from prospective students or staff written in connection with an application to the University or any comments written about them in emails).\nThey should not, therefore, record comments or other data about individuals which they would not be comfortable with the individual seeing, either in emails or elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Immediately report the matter to their line manager and bring it to the Data Protection team's attention, if they find any lost or discarded data which they believe contains personal data, (for example, may include a memory stick).</li>\n<li>Immediately report the matter to their line manager and bring it to the Data Protection team's attention, if they become aware that personal data has been accidentally lost or stolen or inadvertently disclosed (for example, if their laptop is stolen or their phone is lost and it has personal data stored on it),</li>\n<li>Hold the contents of any personal data which comes into their possession securely.</li>\n<li>Ensure that any personal data they provide to the University (for example, their contact details) is accurate.</li>\n<li>Notify the University promptly of any changes to their personal data (for example, change of address or emergency contact details).</li>\n<li>Only ever obtain or use personal data relating to third parties for approved work or study-related purposes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Staff and students who process 'personal data' must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure that they only ever process personal data in accordance with requirements of the Data Protection Act and in particular:</li>\n<li>ensure that they have a valid lawful basis in order to process the data before commencing the processing.\nand</li>\n<li>only process \u2018special category data\u2019, if the processing meets one of the additional conditions for special category data.\nand <ul>\n<li> follow the 6 Data Protection principles.\nThe best way to ensure compliance is through familiarisation with this policy and the guidance we provide.\nKey points insofar as compliance is concerned include:</li>\n<li>Fair processing - for example, ensure that the individual consents to their data being used and knows what it will be used for, and ensure that it is not subsequently used for something else</li>\n<li>Data Security - ensure any personal data which is held is always kept and disposed of securely, (taking into account any cybersecurity considerations).</li>\n<li>Non-disclosure - ensure personal data is not disclosed to any unauthorised third party.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Familiarise themselves with the guidance and other information published on our Data Protection site and follow it at all times.</li>\n<li>If they are going to be working remotely or using a mobile device to store data (for example, a laptop, tablet or mobile phone), it is vital that they are familiar with our Remote Working &amp.\nUse of Mobile Device Guidance, and comply with it and the University's IT Security Policy as special considerations apply.</li>\n<li>Be mindful of the scope of Data Protection regulations.\nThis includes that fact that 'personal data' is widely defined, (and so will cover for example comments made about an individual in an email to someone else), and the fact that it covers data held on remote devices (such as tablets and on mobile phones) regardless of who owns the actual device and where the device is stored.</li>\n<li>Seek advice whenever a new or novel form of processing personal data is contemplated or if any data protection related concerns ever arise.</li>\n</ol> Personal data in the public domain <p>We hold certain information about staff and students in the public domain.\nPersonal data classified as being in the 'public domain' refers to information which will be publicly available worldwide and may be disclosed to third parties without recourse to the data subject.</p>\n<p>Our practice is to make the following items of data freely available unless individuals have objected:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>names of members of Council and Senate</li>\n<li>staff workplace email addresses and telephone numbers</li>\n<li>student university email addresses</li>\n<li>academic staff biographies and curricula vitae where supplied</li>\n<li>names and academic qualifications of academic and support staff where appropriate</li>\n<li>any additional information relating to data subjects which they have agreed to be placed in the public domain and which may be in automated and/or manual form.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Similarly, as part of its regular business activities, the University may process personal information about third parties which is already in the public domain where such processing is carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Act principles set out below and is unlikely to cause any damage or distress to the data subject.</p> Data Protection Act principles <p>Anyone using personal data must comply with the 6 Data Protection Principles contained in the Data Protection Act 2018 as they define how personal data can be legally processed: In summary these state that personal data shall:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Be obtained and processed fairly, lawfully and transparently.</li>\n<li>Be processed for specified explicit and lawful purposes and shall not be processed in any manner incompatible with these purposes.</li>\n<li>Be adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes.</li>\n<li>Be accurate and kept up to date.</li>\n<li>Not be kept for any longer than is necessary.</li>\n<li>Be processed in a secure manner.</li>\n</ol> Data security <p>Keeping personal data properly secure is key in complying with the Data Protection Act.\nAll staff are therefore responsible for ensuring that if they keep personal data, it is kept securely and is not disclosed (either orally or in writing or accidentally) to any unauthorised party.</p>\n<p>Please see the guidance on Disclosing Data for further information on this point.</p> Keeping personal data secure <p>This includes, as a minimum:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensuring that any personal data recorded in paper form or hard copy documents are kept in locked filing cabinets or locked drawers or in locked offices.</li>\n<li>Ensuring that the same measures are taken in regards to any discs or memory sticks or similar devices on which personal data is held, for example, they must also be kept in a secure and locked location.</li>\n<li>Ensure that if any personal data is held on a Mobile Device that it is properly password protected and where appropriate encrypted.</li>\n<li>Ensuring special care is taken whenever data is transferred from one place to another to ensure the security of the data is paramount, (for example, to avoid losing memory sticks in transit or to avoid sensitive personal data being transferred to a PC which is not password protected and encrypted).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please see the section on data security and the University's IT Security Policy for further information and rules on security.</p> Prohibited activities <p>The following activities are strictly prohibited:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>using data obtained for one purpose for another supplemental purpose (for example, using contact details provided for HR-related purposes for marketing purposes)</li>\n<li>disclosing personal data to a third person outside the University without the consent of the data subject.</li>\n</ul> Right to access information <p>Individuals have the right to access any personal data that relates to them which the University holds.\nAny person who wishes to exercise this right should see the Subject Access Rights Page for details on how to do so.</p> Research - special consideration <p>Before commencing any research which will involve obtaining or using personal data, the researcher (whether a student or member of staff) and their academic supervisor or Head of Group must give proper consideration to this policy and the guidance contained on our Data Protection webpages and our Research Data Policy and how these will be properly complied with.</p>\n<p>In particular, they will need to consider the type of personal data which may be collected, the applicable lawful basis for the processing, whether any special category data is to be processed and if so what additional condition for special category data will be relied on and what additional safeguards required, how ethical consent is to be recorded, the extent to which such data may legitimately be required for the academic objective, how the data will be securely stored, and the duration for which it will be retained.</p>\n<p>Personal data obtained or used for research should be limited to the minimum amount of data which is reasonably required to achieve the desired academic objectives and wherever possible any such personal data should be made anonymous so that the data subjects cannot be identified.</p>\n<p>For more information refer to the Research Data Policy.</p> Implications of breaching this policy <p>It is a condition of employment in the case of staff and enrolment in the case of students that staff and students will abide by the policies and rules of the University.\nAny breach of this policy will be considered to be a disciplinary offence and may lead to disciplinary action.\nA serious breach of the Data Protection Act may also result in the University and/or the individual being held liable in law.</p> Conclusion <p>Compliance with the Data Protection Act is the responsibility of all members of the University.\nAny questions about this policy or any queries concerning data protection matters should be raised with the Data Protection team</p> Data protection notification <p>The Information Commissioner maintains a public register of organisations that use personal data.\nThe University has an entry on this register which specifies the main types of data we hold (for example, personal details, education and training info), the main purposes for which we use the data (for example, HR administration, student and staff support services, education and research, and so on) and those to whom it may be disclosed (for example, funding councils, central government).</p>\n<p>The University's Registration Number is Z6290890.\nOur registration is renewable annually, although we can make additions or changes to it at any time, (for example, if we start to process a new type of data).</p>\n<p>In practice, most routine uses of personal data by staff will be covered by our Registration.\nHowever, if you are processing any data (for example, maintaining a database or running a research project involving the use of personal data) and think it may involve us handling new personal data for the first time or using personal data for a new purpose, please email the Data Protection team for advice, and so that our Registration can be amended if necessary.</p>\n<p>The University's current Registration can be viewed via the search facility on the Information Commissioner's website.</p> Data Protection team dataprotection-queries@lists.bath.ac.uk \u00a9 University of Bath 2020 <ul>\n<li>Disclaimer</li>\n<li>Freedom of

are a student apprentice you should additionally refer to the supplementary statement at the bottom of this page.</em>\n</p> Understanding Data Protection <p>While you are a student at the University of Bath and after you cease to be a student, the University needs to collect, store, use and disclose certain data about you for purposes connected with your studies, including providing services to applicants, current students and alumni.</p>\n<p>By registering at the University of Bath as a student, you consent to the University collecting, storing, using and disclosing data about you for any purposes connected with your studies, your health and safety and for other legitimate reasons while you are a student, and also for certain purposes after you cease to be student, and as detailed in this document.</p>\n<p>When we process data about you, we have to observe the requirements of the Data Protection Act.\nThe Act establishes a framework within which information about individuals can be legally collected, stored, used and disclosed.\nThis statement is designed to highlight the areas of Data Protection which are particularly relevant to you, and to help you understand how information about you will be collected, stored, used and disclosed.\nIt applies to all students regardless of age, so if you are under 18, you will be treated in the same way as students who are over 18 for Data Protection purposes.</p> Understanding what student information the University will store <p>The University of Bath will collect data about you in the course of our dealings with you as a future, current or former student: for example, when you apply, when you register and as you progress through your course.\nWe may also receive data about you from outside the University, such as information from UCAS relating to applications, and information supplied by referees.\nIf you are a current or former student, examples of the data which the University may hold about you include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your name </li>\n<li>Your contact details </li>\n<li>Details of your emergency contacts - by providing this information, you confirm you have their consent for us to hold their information and use it in case of emergency<br>\n</li>\n<li>Your date of birth </li>\n<li>Your nationality </li>\n<li>Your ethnic origin </li>\n<li>Your academic background and qualifications </li>\n<li>Your academic record while at the University, including details of any degrees which you are awarded </li>\n<li>Any disabilities which you have disclosed to us </li>\n<li>Medical

</li>\n<li>Any disciplinary action taken against you </li>\n<li>A digital photograph of you, which is used to produce your library card</li>\n</ul> How the data will be used <p>The University will only use your data fairly and lawfully in accordance with our obligations under the Data Protection Act.\nThis means that we will process your data in a way which respects the Data Protection Principles set down in the Act and your rights under the Act.</p>\n<p>The Data Protection Act requires us to keep your data secure.\nThis means that your confidentiality will be respected, and all appropriate measures will be taken to prevent unauthorised disclosure.</p>\n<p>Although it is not possible to state every purpose for which your information will be used, the following are examples of how it is likely to be used while you are a student:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To administer your studies and record academic achievements (e.g.\nyour unit choices, examinations and assessments, and the publication of pass lists) </li>\n<li>To assist in pastoral and welfare needs (e.g.\nthe counselling service and services to students with disabilities)<br>\n</li>\n<li>In the event of medical needs or emergencies, for example where we have reason to believe that you or another person may suffer harm</li>\n<li>To administer financial aspects of your registration as a student (e.g.\npayment of fees, debt collection) </li>\n<li>To manage course facilities, such as computing facilities, sports facilities and clubs, and the Library </li>\n<li>To produce management statistics and to conduct research into the effectiveness of our courses and services </li>\n<li>To monitor our equality and diversity policies (e.g.\ncompliance with the Equality Act) </li>\n<li>To contact you with tailored placement and careers opportunities </li>\n<li>To communicate relevant support or other group-specific information direct to applicable students </li>\n<li>Text messaging for relevant activities or

and external audits, and quality assurance exercises </li>\n<li>For marketing and alumni relations purposes </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Much of this data will be held in written (paper or electronic) form.\nHowever, the University also takes photographs on campus and during events and may record lectures, seminars, tutorials, presentations and other events.\nThe student data captured or held may therefore include visual images of students and audio recordings of their voices.\nAs the University may record lectures and other events, such as presentations delivered by its staff or students, such recordings will include words spoken by students or performances given by them.\nYou are also giving us permission to record any words that you may speak or performances that you may give in lectures, presentations or other events which are recorded and also consent to us making any such recordings available to other students in accordance with our Intellectual Property Policy.</p>\n<p>The University also records its graduation ceremonies and makes these recordings available via its website.\nBy taking part in the graduation ceremony you are giving us your permission to do so.</p> Sharing the data <p>The University of Bath will only disclose information about you in accordance with your consent as detailed in this document, or where disclosure without your consent is required or permitted by law.\nThis section outlines the major organisations and the most common circumstances in which we disclose data about students.\n</p> Students' Union <p>We will share relevant data with the Students' Union to enable them to, for example: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Assist in pastoral and welfare support </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Monitor their compliance with the Equality Act and in support of their equality and diversity policies </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Communicate relevant support or other group-specific information direct to applicable students </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Data

&amp.\nAlumni Relations please read their \u202fPrivacy Notice</p> Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) <p>The University is required to send some of the information which we collect about students to HESA, where it forms part of the student's HESA record.\nIf your data is supplied to HESA, HESA may then pass all or some of the data to various government departments and agencies to enable them to carry out their statutory functions.\nThese bodies and HESA will mainly use your data to produce anonymised statistics.\nHESA and the recipients of HESA data are also bound by the Data Protection Act to process your data fairly and lawfully.</p> National Students Survey (NSS) <p>The NSS is an annual survey of undergraduate students who are in the final stages of their programmes of study.\nIt is designed to gather students' views on the quality of the teaching, assessment and support which they have experienced.\nThis information is used to produce statistics and provide summary feedback to individual institutions and student unions.\nThe survey is commissioned by the Office for Students (OfS) on behalf of a range of funding bodies and Higher Education providers https://www.thestudentsurvey.com/about.php.</p>\n<p>If you are eligible for the NSS, the University will pass your contact details to the OfS or the organisation which has been contracted by OfS to carry out the survey, who may contact you to invite you to participate in the survey.</p> Other Student Surveys <p>Both during your time at the University and after you graduate, we also pass your details to respected third parties where applicable (e.g.\nthe Financial Times Rankings for MBAs) in order for those parties to contact you directly in order for you to provide details, should you choose to do so, about your time at the University and subsequently.</p> Sponsors and funding bodies <p>The University may disclose student information to the Student Loans Company, Student Finance England and any other financial sponsor (including your Embassy if relevant) to enable financial matters including the clarification of fee status to be determined.\nDisclosure to such organisations and/or sponsors will only be made where there is a legitimate reason for so doing.</p>\n<p>In other cases, the University will not release data about you to bodies or individuals who have funded your education (such as your parents or employer), unless you tell us that we can do so.\nHowever, if you are under 18 years of age you consent to the University advising your parents as to the amount and nature of any debts you owe to the University from time to time.</p> Study abroad <p>If your course involves spending a period of time at an institution outside the University, or if you have come to the University as a visiting, exchange or junior year abroad student, we may need to share information about you with the other institutions involved in the exchange (within or outside the European Economic Area).\nThis will be done for the administration of the visit, exchange or study abroad, and so that the other institution can carry out its duties in regard to your studies.\nIf you are involved in a visit, exchange or study abroad, you consent to the University transferring data about you as necessary for purposes connected with your studies.</p> References and confirmation of qualifications <p>The University may release data about you in response to a request for a reference or for confirmation of your qualifications.\nThe details of your award (e.g., degree subject and classification) are regarded as public information and will be published on open pass lists and accessible by third parties such as newspapers and prospective employers.</p> Graduation services <p>The University may share information about you and the award you are aiming for with third parties for the purpose of ensuring the appropriate provision of services such as gown hire.</p> UK Visas and Immigration <p>This section applies to students who require a visa to enter the UK to study at the University.</p>\n<p>To assist in preventing immigration fraud, the University is required to report to UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) details of students subject to immigration control who fail to register, who discontinue their studies or who fail to maintain contact with the University.\nWe may also be required to provide UKVI with other information about students.\nFrom time to time, the University also receives enquiries from UK immigration officials regarding the status of applicants or students, e.g.\nto check whether an offer of a place has been made or whether a student has enrolled.</p>\n<p>The University will normally provide information about applicants and students when requested to do so by UK immigration officials.\nFailure to do so, in some cases, could lead to the University's removal from the list of institutions approved to receive overseas students.\nWe will maintain the records about students (e.g.\nattendance) which we are required to maintain to meet UKVI's requirements.</p> Other disclosures <p>Examples of some of the other situations in which we may disclose information about you include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disclosure to law enforcement agencies, where necessary for crime prevention or detection </li>\n<li>Disclosure to local authorities, for purposes connected with electoral registration, council tax or the investigation of benefit fraud </li>\n<li>Disclosure to the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), during institutional audits and other

information for the purpose of verifying the data about you held by the University, by another higher education institution or by government agencies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where the University uses a third party to process your personal data on its behalf a contract will be in place to ensure that any personal data is processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act.</p> Understanding your responsibilities <p>The University will make every reasonable effort to keep your details up to date.\nHowever, it is your responsibility to provide us with accurate information about yourself when you apply and when you register, and to let us know of any subsequent changes to your details, such as changes to your name or address.</p> Understanding your rights <p>You have a number of rights

from using your data for direct marketing purposes </li>\n<li>The right to prevent us from processing your data in a way which causes or is likely to cause you substantial damage or distress.\nYou can

from processing data which is necessary for our contract with you as a student </li>\n<li>The right to require us to correct, erase or destroy inaccurate data </li>\n<li>The right to get access to the
