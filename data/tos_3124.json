ADVERTISING<p>\n<em>\n<br>Effective Date: January 1, 2020&nbsp;</em>\n</p>Changing Privacy Standards and CCPA<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), effective as of January 1, 2020, was enacted to provide California consumers with greater transparency and control over their personal information.\nThis law is shaping US-based privacy guidelines for digital advertising \u2013 in particular, interest-based advertising \u2013 and your rights as a consumer.</p>\n<p>TRUSTX is a signatory of the IAB\u2019s CCPA Compliance Framework for Publishers &amp.\nTechnology Companies.\nUnder this framework, TRUSTX operates as a limited service provider for publishers, and follows the Supply-Side Platform (\u201cSSP\u201d) requirements for real-time bidding and consumer opt-out, as specified in the IAB technical specifications for interest-based advertising.</p>What is Interest-Based Advertising?<p>As discussed in our Privacy Policy, the TRUSTX Digital Advertising Marketplace uses cookies, Web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies to give Publishers and Advertisers the ability to transact and show targeted ads.\nSome of the ads may be customized based on interests generated from a consumer\u2019s visits to different websites in a browser or on other devices they may use.\nThis type of customization is sometimes called \u201conline behavioral advertising\u201d or \u201cinterest-based advertising\u201d.</p>\n<p>Interest-based advertising is beneficial because it helps to support the free content you get on the digital properties of Web publishers.\nAs part of the programmatic ad delivery process, Web publishers may collect personal information such as IP address, location or browsing habits that they pass or \u201csell\u201d to supply-side partners like TRUSTX in order for their tailored advertising buys to be executed through real-time bidding mechanisms.\nUnder California law, consumers have the right to opt out of the \u201csale\u201d of their information by contacting publishers directly, or through the opt-out processes outlined below.</p>Opt-Out Choices<p>TRUSTX offers all consumers the right to opt-out of interest-based advertising and the sale of their personal information.\nYou may exercise these choices in a variety of manners, including directly with TRUSTX via the links on this page.</p>Opt-out of Interest-based Advertising<p>You may opt-out directly with TRUSTX by clicking this Do Not Deliver Interest-Based Advertising link, which will set a TRUSTX opt-out cookie on your browser.\nThe opt-out cookie is unique to the device through which you have opted-out, and there are cases where the cookie may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.\nFurther, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again</p>\n<p>You may opt-out with the Digital Advertising Alliance to opt-out of interest-based advertising from companies participating in the AdChoices self-regulatory program.\nThe DAA provides more information about interest-based advertising across sites and the opt-out choices they provide on this AdChoices page.</p>\n<p>You may utilize the Network Advertising Alliance\u2019s opt-out page to learn more about NAI members who deliver tailored online ads and your choices to opt-out of receiving them.</p>\n<p>Although TRUSTX does not currently operate outside of North America, European Union residents may opt-out of interest-based advertising with companies participating in the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Online Ad Choices page.</p>Opt-out of Sale of Personal Information<p>In the traditional sense of the word \u201csell,\u201d TRUSTX does not sell personal information.\nHowever, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) defines the word \u201csell\u201d as any exchange of personal information for something of value, such as the delivery of an interest-based ad.</p>\n<p>Our publishers may use our technology to sell personal information as defined by California law.\nIf you wish to opt out of the use or \u201csale\u201d of your personal information for interest-based advertising purposes, you may opt-out by clicking Do Not Sell My Personal Information.\nWhen you select this option, TRUSTX will set an opt-out cookie on your browser.\nThe opt-out cookie is unique to the device through which you have opted-out, and there are cases where the cookie may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.\nFurther, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again.</p>Results of Opting Out<p>If you opt-out, you still may receive advertising from the TRUSTX Ad Marketplace when you visit websites of a publisher who uses our Services \u2013 but such advertising will not be targeted to you.</p>\n<p>Note that we have retained the services of select third-party vendors for measurement, fraud and malware prevention and ad verification purposes.\nWe have agreements with these third-party vendors that compel them to treat information we share with them as confidential, and to process such information solely to provide us with the services we have contracted.\nFor a list of the third-party service providers we use in connection with the Services, please contact us at privacy@trustx.org</p>\n<p>These vendors, and ad buyers that participate in the TRUSTX Ad Marketplace, may also use their own cookies and other ad technologies to display and track ads.\nWe do not control and are not responsible for such third-party partners\u2019 information practices or their use of cookies and other ad service technologies.\nTo learn more about the practices of these companies, please read their privacy policies.</p>\n<p>In the event that you opt-out of the sale of data for purposes related to CCPA, but you do not opt-out of interest-based advertising more generally, you may continue to receive ads tailored to your interests through other companies.\nThese ads may be based upon personal information (a) not sold by TRUSTX-related publishers.\n(b) sold to third parties at least ninety (90) days before you opted out.\nor (c) sold by other sources from which you have not opted out.</p>Right to Know and Delete<p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to know certain information about our data practices in the preceding twelve months.\nIn particular, you have the right to request the following from us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The categories of personal information we have collected about you;</li>\n<li>The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;</li>\n<li>The categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold;</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business purpose or sold.\nand</li>\n<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also have the right to request the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, and have the right to delete the personal information we have collected from you.</p>\n<p>To exercise any of these rights, please submit a request to privacy@trustx.org.\nYour requests must include \u201cCalifornia Privacy Rights Request\u201d in the subject line, and you must include your name, street address, city, state and ZIP code.\nPlease note that TRUSTX is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided e-mail address or mailing address provided below.\nIn the request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request.\nWe will confirm receipt of your request within 10 business days.\nWe may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and process your request.\nIf we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your request to know or delete.</p>Contact Us<p>For additional privacy-related questions, please

2020</em>&nbsp;<br>\u200d<br>TRUSTX is committed to the highest standards for personal privacy and user choice.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve created this simple privacy FAQ that addresses common user questions and explains the choices you have when TRUSTX handles your personal information in our Digital Advertising Marketplace.</p>\n<p>In addition, we\u2019ve included a detailed Privacy Policy and some direct links to a few important privacy-related resources.\nIf you have any questions about privacy and TRUSTX, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to privacy@trustx.org.\nWe\u2019ll do our best to get back to you right away.</p>FAQ: THE TRUSTX AD MARKETPLACE AND YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION&nbsp;<p>TRUSTX is a Digital Advertising Marketplace.\nWe provide supply-side programmatic advertising technology and services to a select group of digital content publishers, which enables them to sell advertising in an automated, programmatic fashion to advertisers.\nOne of the benefits we provide for publishers is the facilitation of ad targeting, or what is often referred to as \u201cinterest-based advertising.\u201d</p>\n<p>The most common question we hear from consumers when it comes to interest-based advertising is, \u201cWhat type of personal information do you collect and use to deliver this type of targeted advertising?\u201d</p>\n<p>When you browse one of our publisher\u2019s websites, the publisher collects certain information about you and your device, which the publisher sends us each time they want us to attempt to sell an advertisement on their behalf.\nThis information does not directly identify you \u2013 that is, publishers don\u2019t send us your name, email address or any other contact details.\nThey do send us technical identifiers, such as your browser\u2019s cookie, a mobile device ID and an IP addresses.\nThese technical identifiers are considered \u201cpersonal information\u201d under certain privacy and data protection laws.</p>\n<p>When a publisher provides us this type of personal information about its users, we act as their service provider or processor of this information on their behalf, by passing the information to advertisers so they can respond with an ad they believe will be relevant to you.</p>How does TRUSTX facilitate interest-based advertising?<p>The TRUSTX Advertising Marketplace passes technical identifiers \u2013 cookies, device identifiers and similar technologies \u2013 to buy-side technology providers or buyers, who use this information to transact in an automated fashion.\nBecause some of these identifiers are persistent across the Internet, ads may be customized based on interests generated from a user\u2019s visits to different websites via the same browser or device.\nThis type of customization \u2013 or targeting \u2013 is often referred to as \u201conline behavioral advertising\u201d or \u201cinterest-based advertising.\u201d</p>\n<p>Interest-based advertising means that publishers and advertisers share some level of personal information about users, which helps companies like TRUSTX better match a relevant advertisement with the user.\n<br>\n</p>What kinds of personal information does TRUSTX collect from publishers?<br>\n<p>Broadly speaking, the term \u201cpersonal information\u201d can mean directly identifiable data, such as a person\u2019s name, email address or physical address, or it can mean technical information that identifies a user\u2019s device or browser (e.g., mobile device ID or browser cookie) and an IP address.</p>\n<p>As we explained in the introduction to this section, TRUSTX accepts technical information from publishers, although in some cases, publishers may send us generalized user-level attributes, such as a broad demographic segment (e.g., \u201cfemale, 18 to 39 years old\u201d), which we\u2019ll include when we offer the ad inventory for sale on publishers\u2019 behalf as part of the programmatic ad delivery process.\nWe have contracts with our publishers that bind them to send us only these categories of personal information, and only in accordance with laws and their own privacy policies.</p>What kinds of personal information does TRUSTX collect directly from users?<p>TRUSTX also collects technical information that identifies a user\u2019s device or browser, and we can independently identify each user\u2019s IP address.</p>Do we sell your personal information? <p>No, we do not \u201csell\u201d personal information in the traditional sense of the word.\nHowever, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) defines the word \u201csell\u201d as any exchange of personal information for something of value, such as the delivery of an interest-based ad.</p>\n<p>For TRUSTX to facilitate programmatic real-time bidding, TRUSTX (a supply-side platform) must pass technical information (and in some cases, user-specific attributes) from our publishers to demand-side platforms (who provide technology and services to advertisers) in order to execute an ad sale.\nThus, under the CCPA definition, TRUSTX facilitates the \u201csale\u201d of personal information from publishers so that advertisers may purchase interest-based advertising from our publisher members.</p>Can you opt-out of the sale of your personal information?<p>Yes.\nYou may instruct any of our publishers to not sell your personal information, as defined by the CCPA.\nWe encourage you to opt-out directly with those specific publishers for whom you\u2019d like to exercise your \u201cdo not sell\u201d choice.\nYou may find a list of our publishers here, and can find opt-out links within their privacy policies.\nTRUSTX will honor the \u201cdo not sell\u201d choices you have made with any and all of our publishers.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to opt-out of the sale of your personal information through TRUSTX directly, which will affect how we handle your personal information received from all of our publishers, you may opt-out by clicking this Do Not Sell My Personal Information link.\nPlease note that by using this opt-out method, TRUSTX will treat your choice not only as a \u201cdo not sell\u201d choice, but also as if you have opted-out of all interest-based advertising across all of our publishers.\nIn other words, an opt-out with TRUSTX eliminates all ad targeting based on any type of personal information.</p>\n<p>Importantly, please understand that if you choose to opt-out with TRUSTX, your choice will apply only to programmatic advertising processed by TRUSTX.\nwe cannot affect how our publishers or other supply-side providers handle your personal information.</p>Can you opt-out of interest-based advertising?<p>Yes.\nYou may opt-out of receiving interest-based advertising that we facilitate on behalf of our publisher members.\nThese methods, however, may require that you opt-out separately from each browser and each device you use, since different browsers and devices use different identifiers.\nIf you opt-out of interest-based advertising, we will no longer collect the personal information described above from the opted-out device.</p>\n<p>There are two ways in which you can directly opt-out of TRUSTX facilitating interest-based advertising.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We honor the Do Not Track (DNT) signal, which can be turned on or off in your browser.\nWhen the DNT signal is on, we will treat your browser as if you have opted out of interest-based advertising.</li>\n<li>You may opt-out by clicking this Do Not Deliver Interest-Based Advertising link, which will set a TRUSTX opt-out cookie on your browser.\nThe opt-out cookie is unique to the device through which you have opted-out, and there are cases where the cookie may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.\nFurther, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising with TRUSTX, you may still receive interest-based advertising when browsing our publishers\u2019 websites unless you use the other choice mechanisms we outline in our detailed Privacy Policy and in our publisher members\u2019 privacy policies.</p>Want to understand more about your privacy choices?<p>We encourage you to read

members to offer, and our advertising partners to buy, interest-based advertising.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use Publisher Data and the information we directly collect for our legitimate business interests, some of which are \u201cbusiness purposes\u201d under California law, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To operate and improve the Services;</li>\n<li>To use aggregated information to compile

the Services in the following two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>With select third-party service providers </strong>for measurement, fraud and malware prevention and ad verification purposes.\nWe have agreements with these third-party service providers that compel them to treat information we share as confidential, and to process such information solely to provide us with the services for which we have contracted.\nFor a list of the third-party service providers we use in connection with the Services, please contact us at privacy@trustx.org.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With demand-side platform providers</strong>, to enable our publisher members to offer, and our advertising partners to buy, interest-based advertising.\nThese demand-side platform providers may make certain information available to their media buying clients (e.g., advertisers) who may use it to make decisions regarding buying advertising inventory, and to analyze the effectiveness and performance of their advertising campaigns.</li>\n</ul>Your Rights and Choices<p>You have the right to opt-out of having your personal information used for the delivery of interest-based advertising.\nThere are a number of ways in which you can exercise this right.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Directly with any of our publishers:</strong> TRUSTX requires that our publishers post a clear and conspicuous privacy policy that includes explicit instructions on how to opt-out of interest-based advertising.\nThese policies are generally available on all content pages where personal information is collected or used.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>By enabling the Do Not Track setting in your browser:</strong> Most web browsers offer users the opportunity to set a Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) flag, which sends a signal to online adverting technology companies, like TRUSTX, not to collect or use information associated with the browser for interest-based advertising purposes.\nTRUSTX respects this signal.\nWhen the DNT signal is on, we will treat your device as if you have opted-out of the collection or use of any personal information for interest-based advertising.Please note that while TRUSTX will observe your DNT settings, each of our publisher members may or may not elect to comply with DNT, as may be described in each publisher\u2019s privacy policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>By declining or deleting cookies:</strong> You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies.\nMost browsers accept cookies by default.\nIf you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately.\nYour ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>By resetting your mobile device\u2019s advertising ID:</strong> You can do this at any time through your device settings, which allows you to limit the use of information collected about you.\nFor information on how to this on Apple or Android devices, please visit your device manufacturer\u2019s websites.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>By opting-out through the DAA AdChoices or NAI Opt-Out Programs:</strong> We require our publishers and advertisers to comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance AdChoices program, an industry self-regulatory program that allows consumers to opt-out of the use of cookie and non-cookie-based information for the purpose of delivering interest-based advertising.&nbsp;You can read more about the DAA AdChoices program and how to opt-out of interest-based advertising&nbsp;here.\nYou may read more about the Network Advertising Alliance\u2019s opt-out choices here.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>By opting-out with TRUSTX directly:</strong> Clicking this Do Not Deliver Interest-Based Advertising link sets a TRUSTX opt-out cookie on your browser.\nThe opt-out cookie is unique to the device through which you have opted-out, and there are cases where the cookie may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.\nFurther, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>California residents and data subjects in Europe have additional rights as set forth in the section below entitled \u201cAdditional Disclosures for California Residents.\u201d</p>TRUSTX as a Limited Service Provider, Third Party and Data Processor<p>When TRUSTX provides Ad Marketplace services to publishers, we may use personal information provided by publishers to facilitate the delivery of interest-based advertising.\nOur role, with respect to personal information, is defined under various laws in different parts of the world.</p>\n<p>In the United States, in accordance with the CCPA, TRUSTX acts as a <strong>limited service provider</strong>, or a <strong>third party</strong>, with respect to your personal information, depending on the circumstances.\nWe operate on behalf of publishers, each of whom are separate legal entities.</p>\n<p>You have the right to opt-out of having your personal information used for the delivery of interest-based advertising.\nThere are a number of ways in which you can exercise this right.</p>\n<p>The European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) data protection law (the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR) makes a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as \u201ccontrollers\u201d) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as \u201cprocessors\u201d).\nTRUSTX currently does not provide the Services to our publishers in jurisdictions covered by the GDPR, however, at such time that the Services are made available in these jurisdictions, the TRUSTX will act as a <strong>processor</strong> with respect to your personal data.\nWe will continue to operate on behalf of a publisher, a separate legal entity, which is the data controller.</p>\n<p>California law defines personal information a little differently than EU law defines personal data, but both are subject to this policy.\nWhen we refer to personal data or personal information throughout our policies, we mean to include anything covered by either term under applicable law.</p>\n<p>Outside of our Ad Marketplace, there are circumstances where TRUSTX may act as a <strong>first party </strong>or data <strong>controller</strong> with respect to personal information collected on our website or for our own marketing purposes.\nFor more details, please see the section entitled, \u201cWhen TRUSTX is a Marketer,\u201d further below.</p>Additional Disclosures for California Residents<p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to know certain information about our data practices in the preceding twelve months, the right to request more details about the personal information we have collected about you, and the right to delete the personal information we have collected from you.\nIf you would like to exercise any of these rights, please see our California Consumer Rights policy for instructions on how to do so.</p>Additional Disclosures for European Residents<p>Please note that if you live in certain jurisdictions, such as the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d) or Switzerland, you also have certain rights and protections under the law regarding the collection, processing, and use of information about you.\nHowever, at this time, TRUSTX does not operate in any of these jurisdictions and thus does not collect or process any information subject to privacy and data protection laws in these jurisdictions.\nWhen TRUSTX expands our geographic Services footprint to include jurisdictions subject to laws, such as the GDPR, we will update our Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>Do Not Sell My Personal Information<p>To the extent TRUSTX sells your personal information as the term \u201csell\u201d is defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information by us to third parties at any time.\nTRUSTX provides this right to all users, irrespective of the jurisdiction in which you live.</p>\n<p>You may opt-out by clicking Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</p>\n<p>If you select to opt-out, TRUSTX will set an opt-out cookie on your browser.\nThis cookie is unique to the device through which you have opted-out, and there are cases where the cookie may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.\nFurther, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again.</p>\n<p>Even if you opt-out of the sale of your personal information by TRUSTX, you may still receive interest-based advertising from our publishers unless you use the other choice mechanisms identified in this privacy policy and in our publisher members\u2019 privacy policies.</p>\n<p>You will continue to receive contextual and other advertising even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising.</p>Do Not Deliver Interest-Based Advertising<p>You have the right to opt-out of the use of your personal information for the delivery of interest-based advertising by clicking Do Not Deliver Interest-Based Advertising.</p>\n<p>If you select to opt-out, TRUSTX will set an opt-out cookie on your browser.\nThis cookie is unique to the device through which you have opted-out, and there are cases where the cookie may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies.\nFurther, if you change browsers or your device, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt-out again.</p>\n<p>Even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising with TRUSTX, you may still receive interest-based advertising from our publishers who use other digital advertising marketplaces.\nYou may need to use other choice mechanisms identified in this Privacy Policy and in our publisher members\u2019 privacy policies to more completely opt-out of interest-based advertising.</p>\n<p>You will continue to receive contextual and other advertising even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising.</p>Authorized Agent <p>You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your
