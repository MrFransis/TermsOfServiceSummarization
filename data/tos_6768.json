appropriate, or refrain from processing your information in the new way.</li>\n</ul> 4.\nSocial logins <p>Some C40 Services (for example, our Knowledge Hub) enable you to register or log-in to your account through a third-party platform such as Google or LinkedIn.\nWhen you do so, the third-party platform will share some of your (basic account) personal information with us, such as the name and email address you use for your third-party account.\nWe use this personal information to identify you when you log-in and allow you to access C40 Services.</p>\n<p>We do not require you to use social log-ins \u2013 if you prefer, you can always register or log-in using your email address and creating a C40 account.\nYou can also un-link your Google or LinkedIn account from your C40 account by updating your settings/ preferences with Google or LinkedIn respectively:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to un-link your account from Google</li>\n<li>How to un-link your account from Linkedin</li>\n</ul> 5.\nWhat is our lawful basis <br>for using your personal information? <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires us to rely on one or more lawful basis to process your personal information.\nThe following are relevant to us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where you give&nbsp;<strong>consent</strong>&nbsp;(for example, to receive our newsletter).</li>\n<li>We have entered into a&nbsp;<strong>contractual arrangement</strong>&nbsp;or taken steps at your request prior to entering into one (with you).</li>\n<li>Where necessary to comply with a&nbsp;<strong>legal obligation</strong>&nbsp;to which we are subject.</li>\n<li>Where there is a&nbsp;<strong>legitimate interest</strong>&nbsp;in us doing so provided our use is fair, balanced and does not unduly impact your rights and freedoms \u2013 in general,&nbsp;<strong>C40\u2019s legitimate interests are aimed at furthering</strong>&nbsp;our charitable and educational mission (for example, company governance and reporting, delivering services and programs, and networking and campaigning).</li>\n</ul> 6.\nDo we share your personal information with anyone else? <p>We provide your information to our contractors, suppliers and partners who provide services on our behalf, or with whom we collaborate, to the extent necessary to enable us to provide you C40 Services \u2013 provided we are satisfied that they provide sufficient guarantees in respect of safeguarding your personal information and privacy rights, and that we have in place an appropriate agreement with them.</p>\n<p>We may also share your information between our Affiliates (described in the introduction to this Notice), in accordance with applicable data protection law and where appropriate to deliver our charitable mission and C40 Services.</p>\n<p>We may also need to disclose your information to local authorities or law enforcement agencies, if required to do so by law, or as expressly permitted under relevant data protection regulations.\nIf we merge or undergo a reorganisation, in doing so we may acquire or transfer personal information as part of that transaction, but your personal information would continue to be used for the same purposes.</p> 7.\nInternational Transfers <p>As an international organization, we will occasionally need to transfer data outside the European Economic Area \u2013 including between C40\u2019s Affiliates and branch offices but also when we use suppliers and engage with other third parties based outside the European Economic Area.\nPlease note that some countries outside of the EEA may have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security requirements and fewer rights for individuals.\nIn these instances, adequate safeguards, such as European Commission-approved contractual clauses and technical measures, have been put in place to adequately protect personal information.</p> 8.\nSecurity <p>C40 is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure.\nWe take appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure that your personal information is kept secure and to prevent its loss, destruction and misuse.\nWe use strict procedure and security features, such as encryption, permission controls, and audit logging, to ensure your data is handled securely.\nHowever, you should be aware that the transfer of information over the Internet is not entirely secure and although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal information which is transferred online from or to you.</p> 9.\nCookies <p>Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website.\nThis helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site.</p> 10.\nYour privacy rights <br>and choices <p>If we rely on your consent to use your personal information (for example if you sign up for one of our newsletters and consent to us providing you with marketing information), you can withdraw that consent (including the right to \u2018opt\u2013out\u2019 of our using your information for marketing purposes generally) at any time by emailing&nbsp;privacy@c40.org&nbsp;or by clicking \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d at the bottom of any marketing email.</p>\n<p>You also have the following rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To request from us access to (including a copy of) your personal information.</li>\n<li>To ask us to update your personal information if it is inaccurate (and you can ask us to check if you are unsure)</li>\n<li>To ask us to delete your personal information in some cases.</li>\n<li>To ask us to restrict processing, if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage.</li>\n<li>To object to processing where we are (i) relying on the basis of legitimate interests, or (ii) using your personal information for direct marketing or (iii) using your personal information for statistical purposes.</li>\n<li>To data portability in certain circumstances \u2013 where we are processing your personal information (i) on the basis of your consent, (ii) because the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and the processing is carried out by automated means, you may ask us to provide it to you or another service provider in a machine-readable format.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To exercise your rights, email privacy@c40.org.\nPlease note that these rights are subject to exemptions and may only apply in limited circumstances.\nWe may also ask for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes before we are able to comply.</p>\n<p>If your data is subject to the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint to the Supervisory Authority in your country, if you believe that we have not complied with the requirements of the GDPR with regards to your personal information (in the UK, for example, this would be the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, or ICO \u2013&nbsp;www.ico.org.uk/global/contact-us&nbsp;).</p> 11.\nHow long will we keep <br>your personal information? <p>In general terms, we will retain your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected and/ or it is used.\nHowever, if before that date (i) your personal information is no longer required in connection with such purpose(s), (ii) we are no longer lawfully entitled to process it or (iii) you validly exercise your right of deletion (please see section 10 above), we will remove it from our records at the relevant time.</p>\n<p>Where required, in some cases we will keep personal information at least as long as necessary to comply with relevant regulatory or statutory requirements.\nWe will also retain information, when and as long as necessary, to resolve legal disputes.</p> 12.\nChanges to this notice <p>Any changes we may make to this Privacy Notice in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail.\nPlease check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Notice.</p> 13.\nContact Us <p>Any questions about this Privacy Notice or the ways in which your information is being used should be addressed to privacy@c40.org or ATTN: C40
