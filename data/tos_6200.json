any other member of the public involved (all such persons being referred to as \u2018entrant\u2019) hereby agree to be bound by these rules as amended from time to time, and by any competition

think fit.\nJudges shall have the right, at their discretion, to change the rules of a competition while it is running if it appears to them that it would be equitable or appropriate to do so,

promotions unless expressly excluded.</p>\n<p>4.4 All questions must be answered and all other entry requirements fulfilled, including in any \u2018pay to enter\u2019 competition each entry must be accompanied by the appropriate entry fee or proof of purchase as appropriate.</p>\n<p>4.5 Proof of submission or of posting of a form will not constitute proof of delivery and no responsibility will be accepted for lost, corrupted, delayed or mislaid entries.</p>\n<p>4.6 The winner will be chosen in accordance with the competition instructions and the exercise of their residual discretion by the Judges, and either will be the first correct entry drawn from the total entries or all entries will be examined and the prize awarded to the entry that the Judges consider to be the best.</p>\n<p>4.7

health advice.\nDates, destinations and other specific details of a prize are subject to availability.</p>\n<p>9.1 KidRated Ltd will not be liable for any circumstances beyond its reasonable control that prevent the competition being fulfilled, a winner or winners being chosen, or any prize being taken up or fully enjoyed by a winner.\nKidRated excludes liability to the extent permitted by law for any cost, claims or losses howsoever caused that arise by reason of any person\u2019s entry into a competition or the award, or non award, to them of a prize.\nIn the event of any error, whether printing, technological or otherwise, which affects the competition in any way, the Judges reserve the right to administer the competition as though the error had not occurred.</p>\n<p>9.2 If any winner of a competition is unable to take up a prize for any reason, or if KidRated Ltd has not been able, after making reasonable efforts, to make contact with the winner, KidRated Ltd reserve the right to award that prize (without notice to the first winner chosen) to an alternative winner, who shall be chosen at the Judge\u2019s discretion in which case the first winner chosen shall not be eligible for any share of the prize whatsoever.\nKidRated Ltd shall not have any liability in such eventuality.</p>\n<p>10.\nWhere necessary in order to determine an outright winner or winners in a competition, the Judges reserve the right to require that entrants take part in an eliminating contest (or \u2018tie breaker\u2019).\nIf for any reason there are more winners than prizes, whether or not that has arisen as an unforeseen eventuality or is part of the competition structure, the Judges reserve the right to conduct a draw to determine the winner or winners of the prizes.</p>\n<p>11.\nIn any competition where there are only a limited number of prizes, unless it is otherwise stated no entry purchase is necessary for entry, except in competitions of skill or where competition instructions clearly specify otherwise.</p>\n<p>12.\nNames of major prize winners will be available on receipt of a request enclosing a stamped addressed envelope to: KidRated
