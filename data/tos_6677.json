Conditions[/font]\n2\n3[font=\"sans-bold-14\"]Document Date:[/font] 2018-10-16\n4\n5The 0 A.D.\nUserReporter is a tool that allows you, the 0 A.D.\nplayer, to automatically upload hardware- and software-system details in order to help Wildfire Games and community developers to improve the performance and compatibility of 0 A.D.\n6\n7[font=\"sans-bold-14\"]Purpose of the UserReport:[/font]\n8The UserReports indicate which system features (for example CPU instruction sets and OpenGL capabilities) are widely supported by the computer systems of 0 A.D.\nplayers.\n9This allows developers to decide which 0 A.D.\nprogram code is safe to use and which optimizations are most feasible to implement next.\n10If the UserReporter is enabled, the UserReport containing that information is uploaded to Wildfire Games once per program launch (GDPR 13.1.c, GDPR 15.1.a).\n11\n12[font=\"sans-bold-14\"]UserReport data:[/font]\n13 1.\nHardware Details, for example the screen size, CPU clock rate, memory capacity and the sound card manufacturer.\n14 2.\nSystem Software Details, for example the operating system version, graphics driver version, OpenGL capabilities.\n15 3.\nApplication Details, for example the 0 A.D.\nversion and build number.\n16 4.\nThe UserID.\nThis is a pseudonym generated by the UserReporter the first time it is used (GDPR 4.5, GDPR 25.1, GDPR 32.1.a).\n17 The UserID enables developers to count how many 0 A.D.\nplayers use a specific set of hardware or system software without allowing them to attribute the data to any person.\n18 5.\nThe date of the upload of the UserReport.\nThis allows focus on recent UserReports and disregard old reports.\n19\n20The UserReport does not include any specially protected categories of personal data (GDPR 9, GDPR 10).\n21The transmission is secured with SSL.\nData is protected against unintentional loss in encrypted backups for additional time (GDPR 30.1.g, GDPR 32).\n22\n23[font=\"sans-bold-14\"]Wildfire Games reserves the right to:[/font]\n24 1.\nPublish UserReport data, excluding the UserID pseudonym, so that community developers may help contribute to 0 A.D.\ndevelopment using this data (GDPR 4.5).\n25 At the time of the document, Wildfire Games published the most recent UserReport analysis at http://feedback.wildfiregames.com/ (GDPR 13.1.e, GDPR 15.1.c).\n26 2.\nErase any UserReports for any reason, except where a user has objected to the erasure of his or her data for one of the reasons specified by the GDPR (GDPR 18, GDPR 21).\n27 3.\nStore the users IP address to protect against cyberattacks, for no longer than 4 months (EU Court of Justice Press Release No 112/16).\n28 4.\nChange this document.\nThe document date indicates the version of the Terms and Conditions.\n29 The UserReport is disabled with each version update and only enabled if the user agreed to the new document (GDPR 13.3).\n30\n31[font=\"sans-bold-14\"]You agree to:[/font]\n32 1.\nUse the service at your own risk.\nWildfire Games does not take responsibility for damages resulting from this service.\n33 2.\nNot use the service with third-party software or mods that change the UserReport data or prevent the user from being informed of updated Terms and Conditions.\n34\n35[font=\"sans-bold-14\"]User rights (GDPR 13):[/font]\n36 1.\nContact Wildfire Games, by sending an email to webmaster at wildfiregames dot com (GDPR 13.1.a, GDPR 13.1.b).\n37 To exercise any user right, please refer to this contact.\n38 2.\nRight of access to UserReport data concerning him or her (GDPR 15).\n39 The UserID pseudonym can be found in the user.cfg file of the configuration folder of 0 A.D.\n40 The current configuration folder is %(configPath)s.\n41 The user obtains a machine-readable and human-readable copy of the UserReport data in the logs folder of 0 A.D.\n(GDPR 20).\n42 The data can be reviewed before the UserReporter is enabled.\n43 The current logfolder is %(logPath)s.\n44 If you wish to access further UserReport data, contact Wildfire Games and provide your UserID pseudonym (GDPR 11).\nOnly with that we may identify your data and process requests (GDPR 13.2.e).\n45 Data may be obtained in a portable, machine-readable format (GDPR 20).\n46 3.\nRight to rectification of inaccurate UserReport data (GDPR 16).\n47 4.\nRight to erasure of your UserReports if they are not relevant to the development of 0 A.D., if the data was processed unlawfully or if the user objects to the processing and has overriding legitimate grounds (GDPR 17).\n48 5.\nRight to restriction of processing of UserReports if the accuracy of the data is contested by the user, if the data was processed unlawfully or if the user requires the data for a legal claim (GDPR 18).\n49 6.\nRight to object to the processing of UserReports concerning him or her on grounds relating to their particular situation (GDPR 21).\n50 7.\nRight to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (GDPR 13.2.d, GDPR 77).\n51Requests that are manifestly unfounded or excessive are not responded to or may be charged (GDPR 12.4, GDPR 12.5).\n52\n53[font=\"sans-bold-14\"]Legal grounds of processing
