intellectual property rights of others.\nIt is our policy to respond appropriately to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement, as set forth more fully below.\nIn 4\u2011H\u2019s sole discretion, 4\u2011H may remove content that may be infringing on another person\u2019s intellectual property rights with or without notice to the potential infringer.\nIn accordance with the U.S.\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201c<strong>DMCA</strong>\u201d) and other applicable law, 4\u2011H has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.</p>\n<p>If we remove or disable access in response to a <strong>DMCA Notice</strong> (as defined below), we will make a good faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter-notification.\nIf you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner\u2019s) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Site, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following:</p>\n<p>(i) a legend or subject line that says: \u201cDMCA Copyright Infringement Notice\u201d;</p>\n<p>(ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;</p>\n<p>(iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Site on which the material appears);</p>\n<p>(iv) your full name, address, telephone number, and email address;</p>\n<p>(v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</p>\n<p>(vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed).\nand</p>\n<p>(vii) your electronic or physical signature.</p>\n<p>4\u2011H will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail, email, or facsimile at the addresses below:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>By Mail:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>National 4\u2011H Council<br>\n7100 Connecticut Ave.<br>\nChevy Chase, MD 20815</p>\n<p>\n<strong>By Email:</strong> http://4\u2011H.org/contact/</p>\n<p>\n<strong>By Facsimile:</strong> 1-301-961-2894</p>\n<p>It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed.\n4\u2011H may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and 4\u2011H may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.</p>\n<p>Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.</p>\n<p>We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.\nThat person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.</p>\n<p>Without limiting 4\u2011H\u2019s other rights, 4\u2011H may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer\u2019s access to the Site and any other website owned or operated by 4\u2011H.</p>\n<p>If access on the Site to a work that you submitted to 4\u2011H is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.\nYour DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:</p>\n<p>(i) a legend or subject line that says: \u201cDMCA Counter-Notification\u201d;</p>\n<p>(ii) a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the URL of the Site from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);</p>\n<p>(iii) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;</p>\n<p>(iv) your full name, address, telephone number, email address, and the username of your account;</p>\n<p>(v) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central District of California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person.\nand</p>\n<p>(vi) your electronic or physical signature.</p>\n<p>Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.</p>\n<p>If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.\nHowever, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Site.\nYou should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.</p>\nThird Party Sites/Links\n<p>As a convenience to you, links to Web sites operated by others may be provided to you.\nThe Site may also contain or may interact with or otherwise be associated with third party platforms, services, plug-ins, applications, ads, tools and/or other content, and/or links to

Services.\nSome Third Party Services may impose fees for access to their resources through our Site and/or your Account and you are responsible for all such fees.</p>\n<p>Finally, we will under no circumstances be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental or special loss or other damage, whether arising from negligence, breach of contract, defamation, infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights, caused by the exhibition, distribution or exploitation of any information or content contained within these Third Party Services.\nAny activities you engage in connection with any of the same are subject to the privacy and other policies, terms and conditions of use and/or sale, and rules issued by the operator of the Third Party Services.\n4\u2011H disclaims all liability in connection therewith.</p>\n<p>Any interactions, correspondence, transactions, and other dealings that you have with any third parties found on or through the Site (including on or via Third Party Services or advertisements) are solely between you and the third party (including issues related to the content of third-party advertisements, payments, delivery of goods, warranties (including product warranties), privacy and data security, and the like).\nBy logging into or enabling Third Party Services within or in connection with your Account, you are allowing us to pass your log-in information to these providers for this purpose.\nYou hereby agree to indemnify 4\u2011H against all claims, injury and/or damages including, without limitation, attorneys\u2019 fees, that arise out of your use of any Third Party Service, including without limitation from any material that you post on any forum or social networking site in connection with us and/or any other claim related to your use of social media.</p>\n<p>You hereby grant 4\u2011H an irrevocable perpetual license to use, reproduce, edit, create derivative works from, distribute, display, copy, transmit or otherwise use in any way, commercially or otherwise, any material that you post to any social networking site or other Third Party Service in connection with us or our Service.</p>\nDispute Resolution\n<p>\n<strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>.\nExcept as specifically stated herein, you agree that any disputes, actions, and claims relating to your use of the Service and all matters arising out of or related to the Agreement and any applicable Additional Terms (collectively \u201c<strong>Disputes</strong>\u201d or a \u201c<strong>Dispute</strong>\u201d) shall be resolved exclusively by final binding arbitration, except that you may assert claims in small claims court in the county of your residence or in Chevy Chase, Maryland, if your claims qualify.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d) under its rules, including the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nAll of the AAA\u2019s rules are available at www.adr.org, and the rules governing consumer disputes are available at www.adr.org/consumer.\nThe AAA\u2019s rules, including the rules governing consumer disputes, are also available by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nYou may initiate arbitration by utilizing the forms available on www.adr.org.\nIf you have any difficulty initiating arbitration, you may call the AAA at 800-778-7879.\nYou and 4\u2011H are each giving up the right to have disputes resolved in court before a judge and/or jury (except as stated otherwise in this Dispute Resolution Section).\nThe provisions of this Dispute Resolution Section constitute your and Big Lots\u2019 written agreement for resolving Disputes, including the agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201c<strong>Dispute Agreement</strong>\u201d).\nThe most current version of this Dispute Agreement in effect when any Dispute arises shall govern resolution of any Dispute.</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees (\u201c<strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>\u201d) will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules.\nYou agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in Chevy Chase, Maryland.\nThe arbitration will be conducted based on written submissions unless you request a phone or in-person hearing, or the arbitrator determines that a phone or in-person hearing is necessary.\nThe arbitrator may only award those damages and relief as a court could, and must follow the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this Dispute Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Limited Time To File Claims</strong>.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION SECTION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES \u2013 OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Injunctive Relief</strong>.\nThe foregoing provisions of this Dispute Resolution Section will not apply to any legal action taken by 4\u2011H to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or 4\u2011H\u2019s intellectual property rights (including such 4\u2011H may claim that may be in dispute), 4\u2011H\u2019s operations, and/or 4\u2011H\u2019s products or services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No Class Action Matters</strong>.\nDisputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.\nYOU AND 4\u2011H AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nThere shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought to a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated.\nBut if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in this Dispute Resolution Section to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to this Dispute Resolution Section.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Dispute Resolution Section, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section, including the class action waiver provisions contained herein, are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Federal and State Courts in Chevy Chase, Montgomery County, Maryland</strong>.\nExcept to the extent that arbitration is required in this Dispute Resolution Section, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Chevy Chase, Montgomery County, Maryland.\nAccordingly, you and 4\u2011H consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Small Claims Matters Are Excluded From Arbitration Requirement</strong>.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court, subject to this Dispute Resolution Section.</p>\nDisclaimer\n<p>\n<strong>THE INFORMATION MAY CONTAIN INACCURACIES AND TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS.\nTHERE IS NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE
