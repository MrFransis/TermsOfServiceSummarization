publications and services to military personnel, students and those in the mission field, without requiring a subscription fee.\nHowever, we do not have \"501-c-3\" tax exemption in order to prevent the IRS from dictating limits on the editorial content of our publications -- which would hinder our mission.\nNor do we accept commercial ads in order to prevent advertisers from influence our editorial content -- which, unfortunately, they do with virtually every other publication.</p>\n<p>We operate like a C-4 or PAC, which is to say we are not able to provide you a tax deduction for your donation to The Patriot Annual Fund, unless your support qualifies as a professional or business expense.\nSupporting The Patriot Post's mission and operation budgets is the most cost effective way to promote Liberty across the nation.</p>\n<p>We also operate Patriot Foundation Trust, which is a 501c-3 tax exempt organization with the primary mission of providing program and academic grants to foster the proper understanding for our Republic's First Principles -- Liberty and Constitutional Rule of Law over the rule of men.</p> 17.\nMiscellaneous.\n<p>These Terms and Conditions, together with the Privacy Policy, represent the entire understanding of the parties regarding the use of the Web sites and the Publications and supersede any previous documents, correspondence, conversations, or other oral or written understanding related to these Terms and Conditions.\nprovided, however, that there may be additional written terms and conditions that govern User's purchase of products, services, Content, Publications, and other materials through certain portions of the Web site.\nSuch additional terms and conditions, if any, will be specified in the Web sites or by a separate agreement.\nThese Terms and Conditions will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Tennessee, without regard to its choice of law rules, and, where applicable, the laws of the United States.\nTo the extent permissible by law, any disputes under these Terms and Conditions or relating to the Web sites, the Content, the Publications or other products or services accessible or sold by or through the Web sites will be litigated in the State or Federal courts located, and User hereby consents to personal jurisdiction and venue, in Hamilton County, Tennessee.\nA modification or waiver of a part of these Terms and Conditions will not constitute a waiver or modification of any other portion of these Terms and Conditions.\nIf for any reason any provision of these Terms and Conditions is found unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remainder of these Terms and Conditions will continue in full force and effect.\nUser agrees that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between User and the Company as a result of these Terms and Conditions or access and/or use of the Web sites.\nThe Company may provide notice to User relating to the Web sites and/or these Terms and Conditions by sending an e-mail to User's last known e-mail address, and any such notice shall be deemed given and received on the day it is sent.\nThe Company shall not be liable for any delays or interruptions in its obligations regarding the sale of any products, subscriptions, or services through the Web sites which are due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, acts of any government, war or other hostility, civil disorder, the elements, fire, explosion, power failure, equipment failure, industrial or labor dispute, inability to obtain necessary supplies and the like.</p>\n<p>The opinions expressed in <cite>The Patriot Post</cite> are not necessarily those
