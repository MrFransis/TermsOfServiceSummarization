the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.\nSection 512 (\"DMCA\").\nFileFactory.com respects the legitimate rights of copyright owners, and has adopted an efficient notice and takedown procedure as required by the DMCA and described herein.\nThis policy is intended to guide copyright owners in utilizing that procedure, and also to guide webmasters in restoring access to websites that are disabled due to mistake.</p> Notice to Owners of Copyrighted Works <p>The DMCA provides a legal procedure by which you can request any Online Service Provider to disable access to a website where your copyrighted work(s) are appearing without your permission.\nThere are two parts to the legal procedure: (1) Writing a Proper DMCA Notice, and (2) Sending the Proper DMCA Notice to FileFactory.com's Designated Agent.</p> How to Write a Proper DMCA Notice <p>A Proper DMCA Notice will notify FileFactory.com of particular facts in a document signed under penalty of perjury.\nWe refer to this as a \"Proper DMCA Notice.\" To Write a Proper DMCA notice, please provide the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify yourself as either: <ul>\n<li>The owner of a copyrighted work(s), or</li>\n<li>A person \"authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>State your contact information, including your TRUE NAME, street address, telephone number, and email address.</li>\n<li>Identify the copyrighted work that you believe is being infringed, or if a large number of works are appearing at a single website, a representative list of the works.</li>\n<li>Identify the material that you claim is infringing your copyrighted work, to which you are requesting that FileFactory.com disable access over the World Wide Web.</li>\n<li>Identify the location of the material on the World Wide Web by providing \"information reasonably sufficient to permit FileFactory.com to locate the material.\"</li>\n<li>State that you have \"a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agents, or the law.\"</li>\n<li>State that the information in the notice is accurate, under penalty of perjury.</li>\n<li>Sign the notice with either a physical or electronic signature.</li>\n</ul> Registered Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement <p>To exercise your DMCA rights, you must send your Proper DMCA Notice to the following agent designated by FileFactory.com (the \"Designated Agent\".) The contact information for FileFactory.com's Designated Agent is:</p>\n<blockquote> Email: dmca@filefactory.com<br>\n<br> FILEFACTORY CLOUD STORAGE LLC<br> New Horizon, Ground Floor, 3 \u00bd Miles Philip S.W.\n<br> Belize City, Belize<br>\n</blockquote> What We Do When We Receive A Proper DMCA Notice <p>FileFactory.com will follow the procedures provided in the DCMA, which prescribed a notice and takedown procedure, subject to the webmaster's right to submit a Counter-notification claiming lawful use of the disabled works.</p> Notice and Takedown Procedure <p>It is expected that all users of any part of the FileFactory.com system will comply with applicable copyright laws.\nHowever, if FileFactory.com is notified of claimed copyright infringement, or otherwise becomes aware of facts and circumstances from which infringement is apparent, it will respond expeditiously by removing, or disabling access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.\nFileFactory.com will comply with the appropriate provisions of the DMCA in the event a counter notification is received by its Designated Agent.</p> Notice to Users of FileFactory.com Systems <p>Pursuant to the Terms of Service Agreement you agreed to when you were permitted to become a System User, you are required to use only lawfully-acquired creative works as website content, and your website may be disabled upon receipt of notice that infringing material is appearing there.\nFileFactory.com also respects the legitimate interests of webmasters in utilizing media content lawfully, being permitted to present a response to claims of infringement, and obtaining timely restoration of access to a website that has been disabled due to a copyright complaint.</p>\n<p>Your System Use privileges will also be suspended.\nYou may protest a DMCA notice by submitting a Counter-notification as described below.</p> Writing and Submitting a Counter-notification <p>If access to your website is disabled due to operation of the FileFactory.com notice and takedown procedure described above, and you believe the takedown was improper, you must submit a Counter-notification.</p> Writing a Counter-notification <p>To Write a Proper Counter-notification, please provide the following information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>State that access to your website was disabled due to operation of the notice and takedown procedure.</li>\n<li>Identify the material that has been removed and designate its URL prior to removal.</li>\n<li>State, under penalty of perjury: <ul>\n<li>Your name, address, and telephone number,</li>\n<li>That you \"have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as result of mistake or misidentification of the material,\"</li>\n<li>That you \"consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol> Sending the Counter-notification <p>To exercise your DMCA rights, you must send your Counter-notification to the \"Designated Agent\" for FileFactory.com, whose contact information is:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>Email: dmca@filefactory.com</blockquote>\n<p>\n</p> Repeat Infringers <p>If a customer is violating the Company's DMCA Policy or any of the Terms &amp.\nConditions, they will be subject to immediate termination.\nFurthermore, repeat infringers will not be tolerated.</p> Accommodation of Standard Technical Measures <p>It is FileFactory.com's policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures it determines are reasonable under the circumstances, i.e., technical measures that are used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works.</p> Policy With Regard To Non-Compliant Communications <p>FileFactory.com has discretion to handle non-compliant notices in whatever manner appears to be reasonable given the circumstances presented.</p> Submission of Misleading Information <p>The submission of misleading information of any sort in a notification or counter-notification submitted to FileFactory.com voids any claim of right made by the submitting party.</p> Terms of Service - Acceptable Use Policy - Privacy Policy - Fair Use Policy - Copyright Policy - Child Exploitation Policy - Support - Resellers - Premium -

which may include session or other types of cookies, to track a person's activities while on FileFactory.\n(To learn more about cookies, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie.) Such methods and practices are designed to determine when an Action occurs.\nUnless otherwise expressly provided in the Program Rules for the Program Type, in order for a Commission to be earned, a person referred from the Affiliate Site to FileFactory must be tracked by FileFactory from the time the Special Link to FileFactory is activated (i.e., \"clicked\") until the person completes the member registration process and creates an account with FileFactory.\nWe will not be liable to you or any other person for any Commissions or other amounts if we are unable to determine that an Action has occurred, whether due to a visitor's or member's browser settings, lack of AID, App bugs, antivirus software or otherwise.\nFor purposes of illustration only, when cookies are used, the cookies are generally set to expire when a person using FileFactory terminates his or her browser session.\nIf the cookie session expires before the creation of an account on FileFactory, you will not earn and will not be entitled to receive a Commission based upon any subsequent Actions taken by such person.\nFor purposes of illustration only, if (a) a visitor is directed and comes to FileFactory from a Special Link on Site A, but does not complete the member registration process and create an account and then later returns to FileFactory from a Special Link from Site B and creates an account, no Commission is earned by or payable to Site A.\nor (b) if a visitor is directed and comes to FileFactory from Site A, but does not complete the membership registration process and create an account and later returns to FileFactory and creates an account, no Commission is earned by or payable to Site A.</p>\n<p>FileFactory takes commercially reasonable steps to provide you with online access to track and review (a) Actions resulting in Commissions taken by members directed to FileFactory by the Affiliate Site, (b) Commissions accrued, and (c) certain other information using FileFactory's online reporting tools on a password-protected webpage (the \"Reports Page\").\nThe Reports Page is usually updated on a daily basis but is not in \"real-time\" and is subject to final reconciliation, taking into consideration non-completed transactions, Chargebacks, Credits and other potential charges.\nThe form, content and frequency of the Reports Page remain subject to change.</p> 7.\nNO COMMISSION PAID.\n<p>Not all paid products or services appearing on FileFactory entitle you to a Commission.\nFileFactory may refuse to permit any person to establish an Account for any reason and may reject any Action that does not meet FileFactory's requirements or policies and procedures in effect from time to time.\nFor purposes of illustration only, FileFactory may reject an order for goods or services based upon a credit card with insufficient funds.\nYou shall not earn or be entitled to receive any Commission (a) attributable to any revenue collected by us arising out of any tax, royalty and/or duty that we, or those acting on our behalf, collect from any person using FileFactory, (b) paid by us for any SMS, merchant processing or similar fees or (c) results in Chargebacks or Credits.</p> 8.\nPAYMENT.\nCOMMISSION PAYMENT FLOOR AND SETOFF.\n<p>FileFactory's current policy is to issue any Commission payments earned and owing in accordance with the Program Rules for the Program Type within approximately thirty (30) days following the end of the calendar month when the Commission was earned.\nAll Commissions are payable in USD.\nTo the extent we receive non-USD currency for Actions, such currency will be converted into USD in accordance with FileFactory's exchange rate policies and procedures.</p>\n<p>If the amount accrued to you for any payment of Commissions is less than the minimum amount established by us (the \"Commission Payment Floor\"), we will hold such payment until the payment period after the total amount accrued is at least equal to the Commission Payment Floor.\nThe Commission Payment Floor is currently 100.00USD and subject to change at any time or from time to time in our sole discretion.\nWe will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of any such change in the Commission Payment Floor via email, posting a revised version of this Agreement, posting on FileFactory, or via other methods.\nIf you have not earned or accrued referral fees in at least the amount of the Commission Payment Floor in the six (6) months prior to any given monthly payment period, or if your Account is suspended as provided herein, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion without notice to you, and without waiver by us, to charge you an Account maintenance fee in an amount up to 50.00USD per six (6) month period.\nThe account maintenance fee charged may be deducted and offset against any unpaid Commissions.</p>\n<p>If a Commission is paid or owed and a subsequent Chargeback or Credit occurs, FileFactory may, in addition to any other remedies, terminate this Agreement for cause and/or setoff the amount of the Chargeback or Credit and any related fees from any subsequent payments owing to you.\nIf there is no subsequent payment due, FileFactory will send you an invoice for the amount of the setoff amount, and you agree to pay such invoice no later than thirty (30) days following receipt.</p> 9.\nORDER PROCESSING.\nOWNERSHIP OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION.\n<p>FileFactory and its service providers are solely responsible for processing and fulfilling all orders for FileFactory customers, including but not limited to, order entry, payment processing, shipping, cancellations, creditbacks, returns and related customer service.</p> 10.\nNON-EXCLUSIVE LIMITED LICENSE TO USE FILEFACTORY MARKS.\n<p>FileFactory grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable and limited license to use the logos, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and similar identifying material specified by such FileFactory solely for the purpose of advertising the FileFactory Services through the use of Advertising Assets in accordance with Section 3, subject to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, you hereby agree:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>to refrain from purchasing, bidding on, or otherwise obtaining or using keywords incorporating or otherwise based upon the FileFactory Marks on search

Marks on or with any items or web pages or Apps that are injurious to end-users or their property, including but not limited to, items that could give rise to a claim for a breach of an express or

otherwise unlawful or tortious;</li>\n<li>to use the FileFactory Marks exactly in the form provided and in conformance with any trademark usage policies, guidelines and quality standards of FileFactory and not to alter, modify or change the FileFactory Marks in any way;</li>\n<li>to furnish, upon request, at no charge to FileFactory, a representative specimen of your use of the FileFactory Marks;(e) if, at any time, your use of the FileFactory Marks fails to conform to FileFactory\u2019s trademark usage policies, guidelines or quality standards, to promptly remove the
