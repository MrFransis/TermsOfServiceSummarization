\u201c<b>we</b>\u201d, \u201c<b>us</b>\u201d) provides cloud storage and communication services with user-controlled encryption.\nUsing Mega, you and other users can encrypt your files and chats using user-controlled encryption (\u201c<b>UCE</b>\u201d), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files, chats and any data (all of which we call \u201c<b>data</b>\u201d in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, \u201c<b>services</b>\u201d and each, a \u201c<b>service</b>\u201d).\nWe provide our services ourselves and via our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers who act on our behalf, at our websites at https://mega.nz and https://mega.io, subdomains and related sites (\u201c<b>websites</b>\u201d), using our mobile apps (\u201c<b>mobile apps</b>\u201d), our desktop apps (\u201c<b>desktop apps</b>\u201d), our command line tools (\u201c<b>cmd tools</b>\u201d), our browser extensions (\u201c<b>browser extensions</b>\u201d) and our application programming interface (\u201c<b>API</b>\u201d).\nIf you have questions about how to use our services or the great things you can do with Mega, check our Help Centre or, if you can't find the answer there, check our contacts page for details of who to contact.\n</p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:</b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that given under, the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201c<b>GDPR</b>\u201d).\nBy agreeing to these terms, you authorise us to grant that access.\n</p>\n<p> 3 These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound by them, you can't use our services.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS - see clauses 40-51.\nNEW ZEALAND LAW AND ARBITRATION OF ANY DISPUTES APPLIES EXCLUSIVELY - see clauses 52 and 53.\n</p>\n<p> 4 We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via email or via a message in any service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.\nFor more information about refunds, recurring paid subscriptions and their termination, see clauses 58-60.\n</p>\n<p> 5 If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide licence to access and use our services, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.\n</p> Your data <p> 6 If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nby giving them a link to, and a key to decrypt, that data), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.\nThis is particularly the case where you are the administrator of a business account (see clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below).\n</p>\n<p> 7 UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\n<b>If you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data</b>.\nEncryption won\u2019t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nMega will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\n</p>\n<p> 8 You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.\n</p>\n<p> 9 Our service may automatically (without us viewing the file content) delete a file you upload, store, access or share where it determines that the file is an exact duplicate of a file already on our service (a process usually referred to as deduplication).\nIn that case, the original file will be accessed by you and any other user and that file will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these terms.\nAny right of deletion that you exercise will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user.\n</p>\n<p> 10 We will store your data subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because after account closure we may, if we wish, delete all your data.\n<br>\n<br> If we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nSee also clauses 33-35 and 54-57 below which set out details of what happens to users within a business account when the business account is suspended or terminated.\n<br>\n<br> In circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.\n</p> Your obligations <p> 11 Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via one of our websites, one of our mobile apps or one of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers), you need to continue to pay the fees (if any) for that plan (and any other taxes or duties).\nNo matter which reseller or related or affiliated entity of Mega you make payment to, your contract for services is with Mega Limited and is governed exclusively by these terms and our policies referenced in these terms.\n</p>\n<p> 12 We can at any time change the fees for our services (other than those you have already paid for) and/or the terms of any services we provide to you (including without limitation the terms of any \u2018achievements\u2019, \u2018referral\u2019 or similar programs we may offer), as long as we give you (subject at all times to clause 34), 30 days\u2019 notice of any such changes.\nWhere we change the fees for our services, in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement </p>\n<p> 13 If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we can (and this doesn't affect any other rights we may have against you): </p>\n<p> 13.1 suspend or terminate your use of the service and/or.\n</p>\n<p> 13.2 require you to pay, on demand, default interest on any amount you owe us at 10% per annum calculated on a daily basis, from the date when payment was due until the date when payment is actually made by you.\nYou will also need to pay all expenses and costs (including our full legal costs) in connection with us trying to recover any unpaid amount from you.\n</p>\n<p> 14 You must: </p>\n<p> 14.1 where you have subscribed for a service, always give us and keep up to date, your correct contact and any billing details and those of any users within a business account.\n</p>\n<p> 14.2 comply fully with any account verification protocols we require you to follow, including account verification via SMS.\n</p>\n<p> 14.3 comply with these terms and any other agreements you have with us and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n</p>\n<p> 14.4 comply with all applicable laws, regulations and rules when using our services and with respect to any data you upload, access or share using our services and ensure that users within a business account, of which you are administrator, do likewise.\n</p> What you can't do <p> 15 You can't, and will ensure that no users within a business account, of which you are administrator: </p>\n<p> 15.1 assign or transfer any rights you have under these terms to any other person (including by sharing your password with someone else) without our prior written consent.\n</p>\n<p> 15.2 do anything that would damage, disrupt or place an unreasonable burden on our service or anyone else's use of our service, including but not limited to denial of service attacks or similar.\n</p>\n<p> 15.3 infringe anyone else's intellectual property (including but not limited to copyright) or other rights in any data.\n</p>\n<p> 15.4 resell or otherwise supply our services to anyone else without our prior written consent.\n</p>\n<p> 15.5 open multiple free accounts.\n</p>\n<p> 15.6 make use of any additional services which are not meant to be available to you on the plan you have subscribed for (including without limitation additional storage or additional functionality) and for the avoidance of doubt, this includes where, for whatever reason, we may have provided you access to such services.\n</p>\n<p> 15.7 use our service: </p>\n<p> 15.7.1 to store, use, download, upload, share, access, transmit, or otherwise make available, data in violation of any law in any country (including to breach copyright or other intellectual property rights held by us or anyone else).\n</p>\n<p> 15.7.2 to send unwelcome communications of any kind (including but not limited to unlawful unsolicited commercial communications) to anyone (e.g.\nspam or chain letters).\n</p>\n<p> 15.7.3 to abuse, defame, threaten, stalk or

interfere with our, or anyone else's, network, device or computer system.\n</p>\n<p> 15.7.7 to use any software or device which may hinder the services (like mail bombs, war dialing, automated multiple pinging etc.).\n</p>\n<p> 15.7.8 to attempt to gain unauthorised access to any services other than those to which you have been given express permission to access.\nor </p>\n<p> 15.7.9 to impersonate anyone or to try to trick or defraud anyone for any reason (e.g.\nby claiming to be someone you are not).\n</p>\n<p> 16 If you register with us, you will need to use a password in conjunction with your specific account email address.\nYou need to make sure your password is secure, not used by you on other sites and confidential.\nMake sure you tell us straight away if you think or know someone else has used your password or there has been any other security breach.\nWe will hold you responsible for anything done using your account and password.\nMAKE YOUR PASSWORD A STRONG ONE AND KEEP IT SECURE.\nWe are not responsible if someone else gains access to your computer or other device and/or your Mega password and/or encryption keys for any files.\n</p> Intellectual

the services to you and them.\n</p> Copyright Infringement Notices <p> 20 We respect the copyright of others and require that users of our services comply with copyright laws.\nYou are strictly prohibited from using our services to infringe copyright.\nYou may not upload, download, store, share, access, display, stream, distribute, e-mail, link to, communicate, transmit, or otherwise make available any files, data, or content that infringes any copyright or other proprietary rights of any person or entity.\n</p>\n<p> 21 We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that

notice of alleged copyright infringement are on our contacts page.\n</p> Copyright Counter-Notices <p> 23 We process all takedown notices based on good faith acceptance of the representations from the party submitting the takedown notice.\nWe do not review the material before processing the takedown notice.\n</p>\n<p> 24 You may file a counter-notice if you believe that access to a file you have uploaded has been wrongly disabled because it was the subject of an incorrect takedown notice.\nYou should only do so if you are confident that no other party owns copyright in the material, or you have rights to store the material and, if you are sharing it, that you have the right to do so.\n</p>\n<p> 25 Please understand that: </p>\n<p> 25.1 when we receive your counter-notice, we pass it, including your address and other contact information, to the party who issued the original takedown notice.\nBy submitting your counter-notice you authorise us to do so.\n</p>\n<p> 25.2 filing a counter-notification may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party.\n</p>\n<p> 25.3 there may be adverse legal consequences in New Zealand and/or your jurisdiction if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process.\n</p>\n<p> 25.4 if, when using this counter-notice process, you make a false or bad faith allegation or otherwise breach these terms or any of our

counter-notice process at any time, provided that any counter-notices in train at that time shall continue to be processed.\n</p>\n<p> 26 By filing a counter-notice, you are deemed to have accepted the above terms.\nIf you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.\n</p>\n<p> 27 To file a counter-notice with us, you must provide a written communication at

counter-notification directly from the user from whose account a folder or file has been disabled.\nCounter-notifications must be submitted from the email address associated with that Mega account.\n</p>\n<p> 29 If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but shall not be obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10-14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright.\n</p>\n<p> 30 Nothing in this counter-notice section prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.\n</p>

in your account details.\n</p>\n<p> 34 Without in any way limiting the other rights available to us pursuant to these terms to take such further action as we deem necessary in any case, we may temporarily suspend your account, where a pattern of access to your account suggests to us that the account may have been compromised.\nYou will subsequently be required to provide such verification of your right to access your account, as we deem appropriate, before we will unsuspend your account.\n</p>\n<p> 35 We may also terminate, suspend or limit our services or any part of our services, for all users or for groups of users, without notice, at any time, and as applicable for any duration of time(s) that we specify, for any reason or no reason, provided that in any such cases, to the

provision of these terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we do not enforce any right or provision of these terms or if we in any instance grant any concession or indulgence, that will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision or obligate us to grant any concession or indulgence to anyone else or to you again.\n</p>

limitation, denial-of-service attacks, strikes, shortages, riots, insurrection, epidemics, pandemics, fires, flood, storm, explosions, acts of God, war, terrorism, governmental action, labour

Arbitrators\u2019 and Mediators\u2019 Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or us.\nThe following terms apply to the arbitration in addition to those implied by New Zealand law: </p>\n<p> 52.1 Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.\n</p>\n<p> 52.2 The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p> 52.3 The arbitration shall be in English.\nThe Arbitrator shall permit the parties and witnesses to appear by videoconference that we will organise and pay for.\nand </p>\n<p> 52.4 We will pay the arbitrator's fees and expenses unless the arbitrator determines that you should meet some or all of those fees and expenses because your dispute is frivolous or vexatious.\n</p>\n<p> 53 The relationship we have with you under these terms and their interpretation and construction together with any dispute, suspension or termination arising out of or in connection with them, is governed exclusively by New Zealand law.\nMega does not submit to any other jurisdiction other than New Zealand and New Zealand law.\nYou and we submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals (and courts for the purposes of the enforcement of any arbitral award or appeal on question of law).\nThe parties agree to enforcement of the arbitral award and orders and any judgement in New Zealand and in any other country.\n</p> Business Accounts <p> 54 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: </p>\n<p> 54.1 If the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n</p>\n<p> 54.2 The administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of data and personal information).\nand </p>\n<p> 54.3 The administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user\u2019s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user\u2019s password and otherwise deny access to the account and all data and personal information and such users will then lose access to all their data and all personal information associated with their account.\n</p>\n<p> 55 In respect of payment for business accounts: </p>\n<p> 55.1 We will charge the credit card associated with the business account with the applicable fees (including for any specified minimum) at the monthly billing date, on a recurring basis.\n</p>\n<p> 55.2 Notwithstanding clause 55.1, acting at our sole discretion we will be entitled to offer such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms to you as we deem appropriate, provided that where such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms have been accepted by you, we may subsequently revoke such alternative payment methods and/or payment terms on 30 days\u2019 notice to you.\nand </p>\n<p> 55.3 In the event that there is any dispute as to the amount of any payment due (for example in respect of the number of active users on your business account in any month) then our decision on such matter shall be final and binding, and in the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.\n</p>\n<p> 56 Where a business account recurring payment fails for any reason, after 7 days we may suspend the account and all users within that account until payment is made.\nIf no payment is made within a reasonable period of time, we will be entitled to terminate the business account and all users within that account, in which case all data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\n</p>\n<p> 57 Business accounts are subject to a fair use policy as follows: </p>\n<p> 57.1 Business accounts are only to be used for business purposes.\n</p>\n<p> 57.2 Business accounts are intended for multiple users and are not to be held or used by one person.\n</p>\n<p> 57.3 Each user must comply with these terms.\nAny breach of these terms by one user will be treated as a breach of these terms in respect of the whole account.\n</p>\n<p> 57.4 Mega will not be liable to any business account user should the actions of another user within the account, including the administrator of the business account, cause any loss or damage to another user within the business account (including by way of deletion, amendment, sharing or any other dealing with data or personal information).\nand </p>\n<p> 57.5 Each user\u2019s use of the business service must be fair, reasonable and not excessive, as reasonably determined by us by reference to average and/or estimated typical per business user usage of the business service.\nWe will consider usage to be excessive and unreasonable where it materially exceeds the average and/or estimated use patterns over any day, week or month (or other period of time as determined by us) (\u201c<b>excessive usage</b>\u201d).\nIf we identify excessive usage or consider that usage patterns on any business account indicate that any of the usage is not for business purposes we may suspend, and after 30 days\u2019 notice, terminate any or all of the users or the whole business account, in which case data and personal information associated with those users and the account will be subject to deletion in accordance with these terms.\nExamples of such unreasonable usage patterns also include: making non-business data publicly available, adding users who do not appear to Mega to be associated with the business, and uploading or sharing files from non-business related third party sites.\n</p> Refunds <p> 58 Unless otherwise provided by New Zealand law or by a particular service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Mega has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nIf you have made a payment by mistake and have not used the subscription plan services, you must contact support@mega.nz within 24 hours.\nThis will be acknowledged promptly and answered within 7 days.\n</p> Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 59 Recurring subscriptions will renew indefinitely, either monthly or annually, based upon your chosen subscription period, unless the subscription is cancelled prior to a renewal date.\nFor recurring subscriptions established via mobile apps using in-app-purchase platforms, you should refer to your app store account for details of the dates and terms of the subscription.\nAny other recurring subscription will renew on the same day of month as it was established, except in cases where the day is not available due to a short month, in which case the renewal date will be moved to the first day of the following month.\n</p> Cancellation of Recurring Paid Subscriptions <p> 60 Recurring subscriptions established through the mobile app using in-app-purchase platforms should be cancelled through the relevant app store account directly.\nAny other recurring subscription should be cancelled by navigating to https://mega.nz/account in your browser while you are logged into your account and selecting the option to cancel your subscription.\nAny payments processed after an effective subscription cancellation will be promptly refunded by us.\nIf you cancel a paid subscription, but you maintain your Mega account as a free account, access to your account may be restricted or blocked if the level of use is above the limits applying to free accounts at that time.\n</p> Information and Privacy <p> 61 We reserve the right to disclose data and other information as required by law or any competent authority.\nOur approach is referenced in our Privacy and Data Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, both of which are subject to these terms.\n</p>\n<p> 62 You and anyone else

chat facility or internal messaging system we may provide.\n</p> Rights to Third Parties <p> 64 Mega Limited employees, officers, agents, related companies and affiliates together with authorised suppliers of services to and authorised resellers of, our services, are entitled to the benefit of all indemnities and other provisions of these terms which are for the benefit of Mega in these terms.\n</p> Entire Agreement <p> 65 These terms, our Privacy and Data Policy, our Cookie Policy and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in these terms, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nFrom the date they come into force, in respect of any use of any of our services after that, they supersede and replace any prior agreement, arrangement or understanding between you and us regarding the use of our services.\nNo agreement, arrangement or understanding alleged to be made between us, or representation alleged to be made, by us or on our behalf, to you, if inconsistent with these terms, shall be valid unless agreed to in writing by an executive

processing of your personal information and the way in which we deal with other data that is not personal information.\n\u201c<b>Personal information</b>\u201d is the New Zealand term for \u201c<b>personal data</b>\u201d as defined in the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (\u201c<b>GDPR</b>\u201d).\nThe term \u201c<b>processing</b>\u201d is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nMega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) (\u201c<b>MEGA</b>\u201d, \u201c<b>we</b>\u201d, \u201c<b>us</b>\u201d or \u201c<b>our</b>\u201d) of Level 21, Huawei Centre, 120 Albert Street, Auckland, New Zealand is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.\n</p>\n<p> 2 <b>Important:</b> We store all data on servers in New Zealand, Canada and/or Europe.\nIf you access your data or give someone else access to your data using our services and you or they are not in New Zealand, Canada or Europe, you or they may be accessing that data from a country that does not give adequate protection to personal information when compared to that to that given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 2000 or the GDPR.\nUnder our Terms of Service (\u201c<b>Terms</b>\u201d) you authorise us to grant this access.\n</p>\n<p> 3 This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.\n</p>\n<p> 4 The sections of this Policy are: </p>\n<p> 4.1 This Introduction section.\n</p>\n<p> 4.2 The \u201c<b>Your Files</b>\u201d section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.\n</p>\n<p> 4.3 The \u201c<b>Your Chats</b>\u201d section.\nThis covers the encrypted text, voice and video chats you engage in using our services.\n</p>\n<p> 4.4 The \u201c<b>Account Data</b>\u201d section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.\n</p>\n<p> 4.5 The \u201c<b>Usage Data</b>\u201d section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated when you use our services.\n</p>\n<p> 4.6 The \u201c<b>General</b>\u201d section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.\n</p>\n<p> 5 The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data (or \u201c<b>personal information</b>\u201d as we refer to it in New Zealand), wherever you may live.\n</p> Your Files <p> 6 This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (\u201c<b>Your Files</b>\u201d).\nThe following specific terms apply: </p>\n<p> 6.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.\nWe gather a small amount of metadata about the type of file, but that does not disclose the content or information that the file contains.\nIn relation to metadata, see the section of this Policy specifically covering Account Data.\n</p>\n<p> 6.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/folder links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or \u201c<b>personal information</b>\u201d as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n</p>\n<p> 6.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n</p>\n<p> 6.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR and which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Files are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n</p>\n<p> 6.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below).\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files unless you have exported a Recovery Key.</b>\n</p>\n<p> 6.6 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our Terms.\n</p>\n<p> 6.7 The deletion process specified in clause 6.6 will not apply to a deduplicated file that is associated with another user (see our Terms).\n</p>\n<p> 6.8 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our Cookie Policy, Terms or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n</p>\n<p> 6.9 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Files.\n</p> Your Chats <p>7 This is the section of this Policy that covers the content of your text, voice and video chats (\u201c<b>Your Chats</b>\u201d).\nThe following specific terms apply: </p>\n<p> 7.1 For private chats, only the people using the accounts that you\u2019re engaging with in the chat can read, see or hear the chat content posted while they were a member of that chat group.\nPublic chats can be read by anyone who has the link to that chat.\nEvery text message you send is stored as an encrypted binary large object (\u201c<b>blob</b>\u201d).\nThe times and participants of your successful and unsuccessful chats are stored in unencrypted form.\nThe content of voice and video chats is not retained.\nIf you have enabled rich URL previews, a plain text preview is generated in our system but is stored separately.\nWhen you review the text or voice chat history and contents, or reinitiate that chat with the same participant(s), the blobs are decrypted in your browser or mobile app.\n</p>\n<p> 7.2 All Your Chats remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because encryption and any decryption of the blob takes place only on your device.\nYour Chats are therefore not personal data under the GDPR (or \u201c<b>personal information</b>\u201d as we refer to it under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020) since they are never held by MEGA in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\n</p>\n<p> 7.3 We retain and store Your Chats because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted chat service that you contract for when you agree to our Terms.\n</p>\n<p> 7.4 Although Your Chats are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Chats and make them available in encrypted form from servers that are owned and controlled by us, in secure facilities in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given by the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, depending where you are based.\nNone of Your Chats are stored in, or made available from, the United States of America.\n</p>\n<p> 7.5 We keep Your Chats while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\n</p>\n<p> 7.6 Chats may be deleted by the moderator of the chat, which may be you or another Mega user (depending on who has initiated the chat and been granted moderator rights).\nWhen the moderator deletes the chat history it will be removed from his or her chat and will no longer be accessible to any participant in that chat.\n</p>\n<p> 7.7 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Your Chats.\n</p> Account Data <p> 8 This is the section of this Policy that covers account information you give us, and metadata and records of financial transactions that we generate in relation to Your Files, Your Chats and your account.\nThe following specific terms apply: </p>\n<p> 8.1 When you sign up for particular services you will need to give us the details required in our registration form and will need to keep that information up to date, including any payment account details (e.g.\nonline payment provider account information) </p>\n<p> 8.2 You do not need to give us any information other than an email address to use a free MEGA account, but the volume of Your Files that you can store and some other functionality is limited with such accounts.\nWhere you wish to access greater storage and other functionality under a paid plan, you will need to give us (including our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers) the information (such as tax identification and payment information) that is required under the particular plan and our Terms in relation to those services.\nFor paid plans MEGA and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers that you use to make payments, retain account and payment information including a record of all transactions on your account.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3 When you use our services, our systems retain the following metadata in unencrypted form: </p>\n<p> 8.3.1 Browser type and operating system of the devices from which you have logged in to MEGA.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.2 IP address and port information for logins, API usage, file uploads, folder creations and link exports.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.3 The country that we expect you are accessing our services from (inferred by matching your IP address to a public IP address database).\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.4 File sizes, versioning order, timestamps and parent-child file relationships.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.5 Deletion timestamps.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.6 The email address of anyone you have specifically made a contact using Mega's systems.\nNote that Your Files and folders can be shared privately by invitation to specified email addresses or shared more generally by creating a file or folder link and decryption key.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.7 Contact email addresses of chat participants, chat commencement time and chat duration, and moderation activity.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.8 Takedowns and account suspensions.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.9 Our communications with you.\nand </p>\n<p> 8.3.10 Your personal account settings, including any avatar picture.\n</p>\n<p> 8.4 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use Mega\u2019s chat facility, internal messaging system or the email address you have included in the settings information in your account.\nAny communication to you will be deemed to be received by you in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017, no matter whether you are actively monitoring the account or its email address or not.\nYou can communicate with us using the appropriate address on our contacts page and your email will be deemed to be received by us in accordance with the electronic communication provisions of the New Zealand Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017.\nExamples of direct communications include copyright or other enforcement emails, notifications under our Takedown Guidance Policy, system update information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our Terms, our Cookie Policy or this Policy and billing information.\n</p>\n<p> 8.5 Access to your account is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is your responsibility to keep these safe and secure as Mega stores the email address but does not store the password.\n<b>If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.</b>\n</p>\n<p> 8.6 We will collect, store, use and otherwise process Account Data so that we can provide the services you have contracted to obtain from us under our Terms.\nWe also have a legitimate interest in processing Account Data so that we can maintain and improve our systems and services and communicate with you as referenced in this Policy.\n</p>\n<p> 8.7 We retain Account Data as long as your account is active.\nAfter account suspension or termination, including where the administrator of a business account, within which you have used the services, terminates that business account (see clause 13 below), we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our Terms, our Cookie Policy, or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 12 months, whichever is longer, or in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account for such period of time as we are legally required to retain such information.\nUsers sometimes request that an account be re-activated so we keep Account Data for 12 months for that purpose.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 12 month period has expired, or after such longer period as is applicable in the case of records of financial transactions relating to your account that we are legally required to retain, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymised, but where you are a contact of, have had a folder shared with you by, or have chatted with, another MEGA user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General section of this Policy with regard to retention.\n</p>\n<p> 8.8 You can download your Account Data at https://mega.nz/fm/account/history while you are logged into your account.\nThis will provide your Account Data but not Your Files.\nYou can request correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020 and the GDPR.\nAny requests for access to, or correction of, Account Data that is not available to you when you are logged into your account, or if you cannot log in to your account, should be made to privacy@mega.nz specifying the information in question.\nThe information will be provided promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.\n</p>\n<p> 8.9 If MEGA has disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), it will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.\n</p>\n<p> 8.10 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.\n</p> Usage Data <p> 9 This is the section of this Policy that covers your activity using our services (\u201c<b>Usage Data</b>\u201d).\nOur Cookie Policy provides more specific information on certain types of Usage Data and your rights to control when it is collected and what it is used for.\nSubject at all times to the rights you have pursuant to our Cookie Policy the following specific terms apply: </p>\n<p> 9.1 We may: </p>\n<p> 9.1.1 collect Usage Date to assist in the operation and improvement of our services.\n</p>\n<p> 9.1.2 join Usage Data with other users' data and give it to advertisers in a way which doesn't personally identify any particular user.\n</p>\n<p> 9.1.3 analyse and use Usage Data for marketing or statistical purposes as well as to improve the way we do business with our users.\nand </p>\n<p> 9.1.4 serve advertisements or use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our services and on third party sites, as well as to assist us in analysing our marketing and other business efforts.\n</p>\n<p> 9.2 We collect and keep Usage Data with your consent to provide services and support related to our services, for market and product research and to be able to give users promotional material and special offers on our services.\n</p>\n<p> 9.3 See also the General section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Usage Data.\n</p> General <p> 10 This is the section of this Policy that covers all types of data.\n</p> Basis of processing and dealing with data <p> 11 As noted above, we process your personal information because we have contracted with you to do so under our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nWe cannot provide our services without that data.\nOther data that is not personal information is also dealt with by us in accordance with our Terms, this Policy, our Cookie Policy and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n</p> Giving access to other users <p> 12 You must ensure that anyone to whom you give access to any of Your Files, Your Chats or your Account Data complies with our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.\nThis applies particularly where you are the administrator of a business account.\n</p>\n<p> 13 For business accounts, the administrator of that account can see and deal with the files and data associated with all users within that account (including any data and any personal information).\nIn addition: </p>\n<p> 13.1 if the business account is suspended or terminated, the action will affect the data and personal information of every user within that account.\n</p>\n<p> 13.2 the administrator of the business account will be able to see and deal with, change or delete the files and data associated with every user within that account (including any of Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and any of your personal information).\nand </p>\n<p> 13.3 the administrator of the business account will be able to terminate any user\u2019s account within the business account, restrict or disable usage of the account, change any user\u2019s password and otherwise deny access to the account and you will then lose access to all Your Data, Your Chats, Account Data and all personal information associated with your usage of the business account.\n</p> Your own security practices are critical <p> 14 We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nMEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access.\nAlso, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key.\nUsing the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\n</p> Disclosure for civil or criminal enforcement <p> 15 If we think it is necessary or we are obliged by law in any jurisdiction, then we are entitled to give Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to competent authorities, even if those items are encrypted.\nWe reserve the right to assist any law enforcement agency with investigations, including disclosure of information to them or their agents.\nWe also reserve the right to comply with any legal processes, including but not limited to data breach notification processes, subpoenas, search warrants and court orders initiated by enforcement authorities or other third parties.\nWe may disclose Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data to enforce or apply our Terms, our Cookie Policy, our Takedown Guidance Policy and this Policy or any other agreement we have with you, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us or our other users, third parties or the operation of our services.\nFor more detail on disclosure to competent enforcement authorities and other third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.\n</p> Mega Limited and its related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers <p> 16 You have a contract with Mega Limited (New Zealand company number 4136598) but our services (including payment and personal information processing) may be provided by Mega Limited's related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, in other jurisdictions, subject to applicable laws.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities to collect, store, share and otherwise process Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data and any Usage Data among themselves, as necessary to provide the services, subject to applicable laws.\nAll such entities are located in Europe or in countries (such as Canada or New Zealand) that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR or which have comparable protections to those given under the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.\nYou authorise Mega Limited and each of those related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers to collect, store, share and otherwise process among themselves such Account Data as is necessary to provide payment processing, subject to applicable laws.\n</p> No commercial sale of data <p> 17 We will never sell Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data.\nWe will not disclose or otherwise provide Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data to a third party, or make any other use of Your Files, Your Chats, any Account Data or any Usage Data, for any purpose which is not specifically allowed under this Policy, our Cookie Policy, our Terms or our Takedown Guidance Policy or is not incidental to the normal use of our services.\n</p> Mega\u2019s data security <p> 18 Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data.\nThat is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information.\nFor more information on our security practices, see our security.\n</p> Communications <p> 19 We may send invoices, security or service updates and various other notices by email to the email address listed in your account or using any of our chat or messaging systems.\nThey will be deemed to be received in accordance with our Terms.\n</p>\n<p> 20 If appropriate, some of those notices will contain unsubscribe information so you can opt out of further receipt.\nWe will abide by any email unsubscription request (other than those we need to send for invoicing, security or service updates and other service provider purposes).\n</p>\n<p> 21 In some cases a person may receive an email from us asking the person to confirm their new Mega account email address, but in fact they haven't tried to open an account - someone else has started the process and used their email address either maliciously or by mistake.\nIn these cases, Mega has an ephemeral/incomplete account that might be used to upload files.\nOn request, and after proving ownership of the email address, we will arrange for the account to be deleted.\n</p> Law <p> 22 Subject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, this Policy and its interpretation and operation are governed solely by New Zealand law.\nSubject to the rights that those in the European Union have under the GDPR, you, MEGA and all users, submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New Zealand arbitral tribunals and courts as further described in our Terms and you agree not to raise any jurisdictional issue if we need to enforce an arbitral award or judgment in New Zealand or another country.\n</p> Contact and complaints <p> 23 Questions and comments regarding this Policy are welcomed and should be addressed to the Privacy Officer at privacy@mega.nz.\nFor a comprehensive list of contact details for Mega Limited, and each of our related or affiliated entities, payment processors and resellers, together with details of how to contact our privacy officer and data protection officer, see our contacts page.\n</p>\n<p> 24 If you are in Europe or otherwise have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, you can find contact details for MEGA\u2019s European Representative and European supervisory authority on our contacts page.\n</p> Changes to our Policy <p> 24 We may make changes to this Policy in the future.\nAny changes will be notified to all users.\n</p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.</p> ", "created_at": "2018-09-22 23:06:08.40744", "updated_at": "2021-01-26 10:39:16.89546"}, {"id": 3909, "name": "Cookie Policy", "url": "https://mega.nz/cookie", "xpath": "/html/body/div[6]/div[2]/div[4]/div", "text": " Our Cookie Policy <p> In this Cookie Policy and on our Cookie Settings page we collectively refer to browser cookies and all similar types of technologies (such as local storage, web beacons and device identifiers, which we talk more about below) as \u2018Cookies\u2019.\n</p>\n<p> In this Cookie Policy you can find out about the types of Cookies we use when you access our services and also what is done with the information collected from you via those Cookies.\nWe also explain how you can opt out of our use of Cookies where it is possible to do so.\n</p> Technologies We Use Browser Cookies <p> Browser cookies are small amounts of data that a website places on your computer or mobile device.\nThese browser cookies can be used to store information about the actions you take on the websites you visit, like the pages you\u2019ve looked at and any preferences such as the language or screen layout that you\u2019ve selected.\n</p>\n<p> Browser cookies and all the similar types of technologies we talk about further below, can identify your device, but they can\u2019t identify you personally.\n</p>\n<p> Any browser cookies that we set when you visit our website or use our apps are called \u2018first party cookies\u2019 as we control them.\nHowever, when we use a browser cookie created by someone else (such as an advertising associate), it is referred to as a \u2018third party cookie\u2019 as we don\u2019t control the data that is collected by that third party cookie.\n</p>\n<p> You can find out about the specific third party cookies we use by heading to the Third Party Cookies page in our Cookie Settings.\n</p>\n<p> On the Third Party Cookies page you can also find links to the privacy policy of each third party cookie that we use.\nThese specific third party privacy policies (and not this Cookie Policy or our Privacy and Data Policy) will govern how any information collected by those third party cookies is used.\n</p> Local Storage <p> Local storage works in a similar way to browser cookies.\nLocal storage consists of a small amount of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device.\nLocal storage has some technical advantages over browser cookies in terms of the amount of data it can store, how long it can exist for and the more efficient way it transmits information.\nLocal storage is also used in the same way as browser cookies for remembering things such as any preferences like the language or screen layout that you\u2019ve selected.\n</p> Web Beacons <p> A web beacon is a tiny transparent image file placed on a webpage that can be used, often in conjunction with browser cookies, to track your visits to, and interaction with, the webpage.\nWeb beacons can also be used to track your journey across a website or a series of websites.\n</p>\n<p> When you open a page with a web beacon the small file is downloaded after sending a message to a remote computer across the internet where the original image is stored.\nThis message will include information such as your IP address and the time the web beacon was triggered.\nWeb beacons can be used to identify the elements of a webpage that you might have interacted with including specific adverts.\n</p>\n<p> Web beacons can also operate through a Beacon API to send tracking events such as page views directly to API servers.\n</p> Tracking URLs <p> These are specially formatted URLs that let us know when they have been clicked.\nThey help us track things like when a particular link in an email is clicked on or which option on a webpage is chosen more often.\n</p> Device Identifiers <p> When you access our services our system will generate a device ID (that doesn\u2019t include the serial number, brand or model of your device) and assign this to our record of your device.\n</p>\n<p> We regard the use of device identifiers as being essential to offering you our services and therefore (as allowed by law) the use of device identifiers on our services cannot be turned off.\n</p> Cookie Categories <p> Based on the functionality they provide, we classify all the \u2018Cookies\u2019 we use (including browser cookies, local storage, web beacons, tracking URLs and device identifiers) into the following categories: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essential</li>\n<li>Preference</li>\n<li>Performance and Analytics</li>\n<li>Advertising</li>\n</ul>\n<p> In our Cookie Settings you are able to select (with the exception of Essential Cookies as explained below) the categories of Cookies we can use whenever you access our services.\n</p> Essential Cookies <p> These are essential for providing you with important functionality and secure access to our services.\nWithout them, we couldn\u2019t offer you the services we do.\nFor this reason, they do not require consent.\nWe use Essential Cookies to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> assist in securely connecting you to our services.\n</li>\n<li> ensure our technical infrastructure is operating efficiently in order to deliver our services to you in an optimal way.\n</li>\n<li> identify if you have previously requested the \u2018remember me\u2019 option so as to be automatically logged in when you return to use our services.\n</li>\n<li> determine if you have logged in and then keep you logged in for either the duration of your current session or for future visits as well if you have previously requested the \u2018remember me\u2019 option when logging in.\n</li>\n<li> identify and take action against malicious threats to our system.\n</li>\n<li> observe activity on our services and detect any actions which are against our Terms of Service or that may negatively impact on the quality of use of our services for other users.\nand </li>\n<li> assist you to make purchases from us.\n</li>\n</ul> Preference Cookies <p> These Cookies allow us to remember certain display and formatting settings you have chosen.\nNot accepting these Cookies will mean we won\u2019t be able to remember some things for you such as your preferred screen layout.\nWe use Preference Cookies to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> remember the preferences you select for how various screens in our system should display (such as your Folder view in Cloud Drive) so that they can be displayed in the same way the next time you visit them.\nand </li>\n<li> remember the language you have chosen that you wish to use our services in.\n</li>\n</ul> Performance and Analytics Cookies <p> These Cookies help us to understand how you use our services and provide us data that we can utilise to make improvements.\nNot accepting these Cookies will mean we will have less data available to help make improvements.\nWe use Performance and Analytics Cookies to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> identify the parts of our services that you use more than others and how well different parts of our services function.\n</li>\n<li> observe the devices and settings you use when you access our services to help us to determine what improvements would be beneficial for us to make to our services.\nand </li>\n<li> monitor any changes we make to our services to see if they improve your user experience.\n</li>\n</ul> Advertising Cookies <p> These Cookies are used by us and our approved advertising partners to customise adverts which are shown by us on our services and by third parties on our services and on other websites and services.\nNot accepting these Cookies means you may be shown advertisements that are less relevant.\nWe and our approved advertising partners use Advertising Cookies to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> monitor how often you are displayed certain adverts.\n</li>\n<li> customise the adverts you see based on such things as your location and your actions on our services and the actions you have taken on other websites and services you have previously visited.\nand </li>\n<li> tell us when you click on a particular advert and then to track the following actions you take in response to that advert.\n</li>\n</ul> Managing Cookies <p> When you first access our services, you will be shown a brief message explaining what we use Cookies for.\nYou can either accept the use of all Cookies on our services, or if you do not wish to accept the use of some Cookies, you can go to our Cookie Settings to specify your preferences.\nThese preferences will be saved so that the next time you access our services you do not have to make your choices again.\nYou can also adjust the preferences you have selected at any time by accessing the Cookie Settings page again from the link in the footer of our website or from the Settings page in our mobile apps.\n</p>\n<p> Please note that if you choose to disable some or all Cookies in your browser, it will limit the functionality that different websites and services (including ours) can make available to you.\n</p> Related Terms <p> This Cookie Policy, our Terms of Service, our Privacy and Data Policy, and Takedown Guidance Policy, the terms of any plan you purchase and any other terms and policies expressly referenced in those documents, together constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our services.\nWhere there is any inconsistency between those documents, to the greatest extent at law, the Terms of Service prevail.\nAll defined terms in our Terms of Service shall have the same meaning in this Cookie Policy.\nTo the greatest extent permitted at law all limitations and exclusions of liability set out in our Terms of Service apply equally to this Cookie Policy.\n</p>\n<p>Last updated 18 December 2020, effective 18 January 2021.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-02-01
