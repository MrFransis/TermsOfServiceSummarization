www.matchpoint.social, www.condense.social, www.firestart.com, www.gennex.ch, www.claimsprovider.net) is generally possible without providing personal data.\nInsofar as personal data (e.g.\nname, address or e-mail addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible.\nThis data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.\nWe would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g.\ncommunication by e-mail) can be subject to security gaps.\nA complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>\n2.\nCollection of Personal Data\n<p>In principle, we only collect personal data if it is necessary for the provision of the specific service.</p>\n<p>You can visit our website without providing any personal information.\nWe only store access data without personal reference such as the name of your Internet service provider and your Internet browser, the page from which you visit us, the date and duration of your visit or the name of the requested file.\nThese data are evaluated exclusively for the improvement of our offer and do not allow any conclusion about your person.</p>\n<p>Personal data that indicates the identity of the customer, such as name, address, postal address, delivery address, telephone number or e-mail address, are only collected on our websites if you voluntarily provide them to us when placing an order, registering for an event or webinar, downloading information, license keys or software, creating support tickets or registering for our newsletter or if you use the contact function on the website or otherwise contact us, for example by e-mail.\nWhen ordering goods, we use the data provided by you without your separate consent exclusively for the fulfillment and processing of your order.</p>\n<p>The customer's data will only be used to send a newsletter or mailings with the customer's prior consent.\nThis consent can be revoked at any time without giving reasons with effect for the future.</p>\n3.\nUse of Personal Data\nMandatory and voluntary fields\n<p>Please note that there are mandatory fields for all data

are for example the processing of your inquiry, the sending of our newsletter or the handling of your order or the confirmation of your participation in an event or webinar.</p>\nUse for advertising purposes\n<p>If you have expressly consented to the use of your personal data for advertising purposes, we will also use your personal data for information letters in order to send you current information from time to time, such as invitations to events or webinars, information on trends and current topics, or news on our services and products, by post and/or e-mail.</p>\n4.\nTo Pass on Personal Data to Third Parties\n<p>Your data will not be passed on unless CYCL is legally obliged to do so (e.g.\nrequest from an investigating authority) or authorized to do so (e.g.\nas part of order data processing), or unless you have expressly consented to the passing on of your data to third parties.\nIn particular, data will be passed on to third parties insofar as this is necessary to

the data in accordance with this data protection declaration and the current legal situation.</p>\n5.\nTransmission of Personal Data Abroad\n<p>We are also entitled to transfer your personal data to third companies (contracted service providers) abroad if this is appropriate for the data processing described in this data protection declaration.\nThese are obligated to the same extent as we

corresponds to that in Switzerland at all times.</p>\n6.\nRight to Information, Deletion, Blocking\n<p>You have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, as well as a right to correction, blocking or deletion of this data, if this is possible in accordance with applicable law (e.g.\nretention obligation).</p>\n7.\nData Security\n<p>Your personal data, which is

will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.</p>\n<p>We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended by the code \"anonymizeIp\" in order to guarantee anonymous recording of IP addresses (so-called IP masking).</p>\n<p>On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator.\nThe IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google.</p>\n<p>You can prevent Google from collecting data relating to your use of the website (including your IP address) and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link (http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).</p>\n<p>You can find more

Google may link your web and app browsing history to your Google Account and use information from your Google Account to personalize ads, Google will use your information in conjunction with Google Analytics data to create cross-device remarketing audience lists.\nGoogle Analytics first collects your Google-authenticated ID, which is associated with your Google Account (i.e., personally

opt-out by selecting the appropriate settings in the \"My Account\" section of your Google Account.</p>\n<p>This website also uses Google Analytics' demographic features feature.\nThis allows reports

cookie\") if you have reached our website via a Google ad.\nThese cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification.\nIf you visit other Internet sites and then come to our website, we and Google will know that someone clicked on the ad and was directed to our website, should the cookie not have expired.\nEach AdWords customer receives a different cookie.\nAs a result, cookies cannot be tracked through AdWords customer websites.\nThe information collected from the Conversion cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for Conversion Tracking.\nAdWords customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were directed to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag.\nHowever, you will not receive any information that personally identifies users.\nIf you do not wish to participate in the tracking procedure, you can also refuse to set a cookie as required for this - for example, by
