</li>\n</ul> Privacy Policy <p> This site has taken significant steps to protect your privacy.\nIt should remain this way, given the operating model is not based on advertising or collecting personal information for sale to advertisers.\n</p> Cookies <p> There are no cookies at all for most of this site.\n</p>\n<p> There is however one cookie used during the \"Add Site\" and \"Manage Site\" workflows.\nThis is called \"session\" and is just used for preserving state between requests to improve the experience.\nAs it's name suggests, this is a session cookie rather than a persistent cookie, so is deleted as soon as you logout or close your browser.\n</p> Third-party code <p> No files are downloaded from third parties, so there is no opportunity for third parties to track your use of this site.\n</p> Personal information <p> No personal information is gathered while searching on this site.\n</p>\n<p> In the \"Add Site\" and \"Manage Site\" sections, site owners are asked for their site's admin email address.\nThis is so that they can be notified about important changes to their listing, e.g.\nif their listing was about to expire.\nNote that the admin email address for a domain is often a shared account, e.g.\nadmin@example.com, and is sometimes publicly available via whois, so is not necessarily personally identifiable information.\n</p> Analytics <p> This site uses the Plausible Analytics privacy-focussed web analytics solution to help monitor and improve the service.\nThis solution does not use any cookies, and (in the configuration used here) does not download files from outside searchmysite.net or send any data beyond searchmysite.net.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Community</li>\n<li>Blog</li>\n<li>Contact</li>\n<li>Discussion</li>\n<li>Documentation</li>\n<li>Source</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Product</li>\n<li>About</li>\n<li>Privacy</li>\n<li>Terms</li>\n</ul>

Random PageRandom </li>\n</ul> Terms of Use <p> Welcome to searchmysite.net (\"the Site\"), the independent search engine and search as a service.\nIt has been brought to you by michael-lewis.com (\"We\").\nThese are the terms and conditions of use (\"Terms of Use\") for the Site.\nWe reserve the right to change the Terms of Use.\nBy using the Site you are agreeing to the Terms of Use.\n</p> Submission guidelines <p> You must only submit sites belonging to one of the site categories listed.\nThese are currently \"personal websites\" and \"independent websites\".\n</p>\n<p> \"Personal websites\" are defined as websites primarily for an individual's personal (rather than business) use, where the individual owns both the content and the domain (i.e.\nit isn't on or owned by a centralised platform).\n</p>\n<p> \"Independent websites\" are defined as special interest websites, i.e.\nwebsites about a specific topic or a broad range of topics, which are operated by an individual or group on a largely non-commercial basis, and where the individual or group owns both the content and the domain (i.e.\nit isn't on or owned by a large commercial entity).\n</p>\n<p> In addition, all sites submitted must also be suitable for minors (given the Privacy Policy is such that there is no age verification to use the Site), and all sites submitted must comply with all laws in your jurisdiction.\n</p> Site removal <p> We reserve the right to reject or remove inappropriate or unsuitable sites, i.e.\nsites which break the submission guidelines and hence Terms of Use.\nIf verified site owners have submitted a site which is found to have broken the Terms of Use, their site will be removed and an attempt made to notify them (if they have paid a listing fee this will be refunded minus an admin fee).\n</p>\n<p> If you find a site which you believe breaks the Terms of Use, please Contact Us to report this.\n</p>\n<p> Verified site owners are free to remove their own sites whenever they wish, and there is a button on the Manage Site page which makes it easy to do so.\nIf a site site has been added via Quick Add and you would like to see it removed, please Contact Us to explain why you would like to see it removed.\nThere will normally not be an issue doing so, but if we believe this is being abused we reserve the right to not action the request.\n</p> Search as a service <p> If you use the search as a service, you must not put unreasonable load on the Site, e.g.\nby excessive use of the reindex on demand functionality, or by making very high numbers of API calls.\nWe reserve the right to introduce limits on use in future.\n</p>\n<p> We take uptime very seriously, but cannot guarantee 100% availability.\n</p> Governing law/jurisdiction <p> The Site's servers are currently based in the United Kingdom, and governed by the laws of the United Kingdom.\n</p> General conditions <p> Use of the Site is at your own risk.\nThe Site is provided on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis.\nWe cannot be held accountable for any form of loss to you through your use of the Site.\n</p>\n<p> Hopefully all of this is fairly clear and reasonably fair, but if you have any questions about these Terms of Use please Contact Us.\n</p>\n<p> Last updated: 19 November
