mandatory</p>\n<p>Some cookies are needed to allow our websites to function correctly, improve performance and provide security to our sites.\nWithout the installation of these cookies, our sites may either not run at all, or give very poor performance.\nTherefore these cookies are installed automatically on your computer.\n<strong>We cannot turn these cookies off, as they provide basic site functionality and security.\nTo do so will prevent access to our service.</strong> We use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>__cfuid </strong>- From Cloudflare<br>\nCloudflare speeds up and protects millions of websites, APIs, SaaS services, and other properties connected to the Internet.\nThe Cloudflare __cfduid cookie is used for two purposes\n<ul>\n<li>To speed up page load times</li>\n<li>To apply security settings on a per-client basis.\nIt does not correspond to any user ID in your web application, and does not store any personally identifiable information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nCookies which <strong>may </strong>contain personal identification - we ask you to either accept or decline\n<p>Other cookies may contain trace bits of personal information, such as your preferred language, to give you a better user experience, or record the number of site visits, the navigation paths, and number of visitors to each page.\nWe use Google Analytics for this purpose.\nThey help us to understand your interests, and provide us with statistical data which we can use in our funder reports.\nIf you log into any of our sites, either with a private login, or by using a Social Media login, then cookies will be installed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We have installed the GDPR compliant solutions provided by Google Analytics</strong>, so that you data is anonymised, and we can no longer identify the geolocation of your IP number.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>_collect </strong>\n<br>\nAmazon\u2019s Google Analytics _collect cookie is used to send data to Google Analytics about the visitor's device and behaviour.\nIt tracks the visitor across devices and marketing channels, though we do not use the marketing, nor have any advertising on our sites.\nThis cookie helps us understand who has&nbsp;visited our sites and which pages they have visited.\nThis information is used to enhance our websites as well as report in aggregated form to our funders.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>_ga </strong>\n<br>\nAmazon\u2019s Google Analytics _ga cookie identifies unique users, unique sessions, and can throttle the request rate if needed.\nIn order for Google Analytics to determine that two distinct hits belong to the same user, a unique identifier, associated with that particular user, must be sent with each hit.\nThis information is then harvested by Google Analytics to provide us with statistical data of site usage.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>_gat </strong>\n<br>\nAmazon\u2019s Google Analytics _gat cookie does not store any user information, it is just used to limit the number of requests made to doubleclick.net.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>_gid </strong>\n<br>\nAmazon\u2019s Google Analytics cookie speeds up the delivery of web content, by using Amazon\u2019s worldwide network of datacenters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We ask, on your first visit following our implementation of the new GDPR regulations, that you either consent to having cookies that may contain personally identifying information installed, or else decline the installation of these cookies.\nOf course, in order for us to know either way what your preferences are, we need to set a cookie! This is a conundrum - but we believe it is the only way to comply with the new GDPR regulations.\nThis cookie is only stored on your computer.\nWe do not keep any record of your decision.\nIf you delete the cookie data, or if you arrive at our site from another computer or browser, you will be asked again to accept or decline our cookies.</p>\nIf you do not make a choice\n<p>If you choose to neither Accept or Decline cookies when our cookie banner displays, and continue to browse the site, our default behaviour will be to install cookies, as we have given you an opportunity to act before cookies are set on a first visit to a site.\nThis is considered by us to be \u201cSoft Opt-in\u201d consent.</p>\nHow to manually change your cookie preferences\n<p>If you wish to change your cookie preferences after the initial GDPR consent request has been completed, you will need to do this manually in your browser settings by either enabling or disabling the cookies.\nWe suggest consulting the Help section of your browser or taking a look at the About Cookies website which offers guidance for all modern browsers.</p>\nSupporter information\n<p>If you have joined our network, we will use the information you have given us to try to connect you with the right parts of our network.</p>\n<p>If you have signed up as a community member, thank you for doing so, we appreciate your support.\nAs a community member you will be able to be more involved in our activities.\nWe will use information you supply us to help you to be more involved.\nWe may use your contact details to get in touch as part of that involvement.</p>\nDonations\n<p>If you make donations to our organisation via PayPal, please be aware that PayPal passes your name and email address to us.\nWe need this information for our Finance system and in case we need to respond to a query.\nWe may also write to you to thank you for your donation.\nWe will not use it for anything else.</p>\nPublic data and publishing\n<p>If you are uploading datasets for one of our surveys or to one of our database services, we request that you check the data and ensure full anonymisation, so that we remain GDPR compliant.\nWe do not wish to restrict a user's ability to provide datasets for public use, so please upload data responsibly.\nIf in any doubt, please contact us via the contact page.</p>\nAuthor identification\n<p>When posting a comment on one of our blogs, a name and email address may be required.\nYou do not have to select your real name or use your regular email address.\nYour email address will not be published.\nIf you decide to comment, link, or pingback to a post, you must keep this in mind.\nIf you are concerned, you may wish to get a free email account or attempt to use a remail service.</p>\n<p>Page edits, comments, trackbacks, and pingbacks and other activity on our websites may be identified by your IP address, though we have now implemented Google Analytics GDPR solutions, which strips out the last two numbers from the IP address in order to become anonymous.</p>\n<p>If you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service or attempt some means to obfuscate your real IP address.\nIf so, you might like to try Tor, an anonymous browsing service.\nPlease see Tor for more details: https://www.torproject.org.</p>\nEmail\n<p>If you have given us your email address through general correspondence, or have signed up to receive our newsletter, you agree to allow us to send email to that address in order to deliver our services to you.\nIn practice this will usually involve emails about project updates&nbsp;or important changes to services to which you subscribe.</p>\n<p>In addition to necessary emails, we will also occasionally use the email to contact you for our own purposes.\nFor example we might want to tell you about new services we are offering or we might be seeking volunteers for one of our many activities.\nWe will only do so sparingly.\nWe understand how annoying it can be to receive large quantities of unsolicited mail.\nWe will do our best to ensure that anything we do send to you will be relevant and unobtrusive.</p>\nServer Logging &amp.\nGoogle Analytics\n<p>Any time you visit a page on the internet, you send quite a bit of information to the server.\nThe web servers that host this site maintain access logs with the information that you send.\nThis information is used to provide site statistics and to get an idea of popular pages and what sites link here.\nWe do not intend to use these logs to identify legitimate users.\nThe data logged may be used by us to solve technical problems with the site and, in cases of abuse of this site, to investigate the abuse.\nWe use Google Analytics to gather data from cookies to analyse our website traffic in order to provide better services and to set benchmarks for how we are doing in meeting Open Knowledge Foundation's goals.\nWe have now implemented Google Analytics\u2019 GDPR recommendations in order to ensure that we meet GDPR compliance.\nThe main change is that we can no longer see the full IP number of a visitor, and so we cannot tell which country the visitor is likely to come from.</p>\nData release policy\n<p>Our policy is only to release the data we collect in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As required by law, such as in response to a valid request from law enforcement.</li>\n<li>To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse complaints.</li>\n<li>When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually when investigating technical issues.</li>\n<li>For abusive users, we may release information to assist in attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user\u2019s Internet Service Provider.</li>\n<li>If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third parties.</li>\n<li>When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of the user community, or this website.</li>\n<li>When you have given consent for data to be used, such as completing a survey.\nAs an organisation that promotes the use of freely accessible data, we cannot be held responsible for the usage of any data supplied.</li>\n</ul>\nNo selling of information\n<p>We will not sell information collected via this site, such as your email address, to third parties.</p>\nInformation security\n<p>We aim to make our sites secure, and that any data you do provide, such as login information, is kept securely.\nUnfortunately we cannot guarantee this, though will notify you (if we have the information to do so) should there be any breach of security, as per GDPR guidelines.</p>\nData subject request\n<p>You have the right to request information from us about data we may hold on you.\nThere rights are enshrined in the GDPR regulation.\nIn order for us to ensure we are providing this information to the correct individual, we will need to verify that we are releasing this information to the correct natural person, and not someone trying to steal your identity.\nTherefore we ask that you help us to resolve your identity as quickly as possible.\nFailure to provide sufficient verification details (i.e.\nyou might need to tell us your IP number in order for us to find a match and confirm your identity) may delay our ability to provide this information within the 30 days required of the GDPR Regulation.\nIf you would like to submit a Data Subject request please email admin [at] okfn.org</p>\nRight to be forgotten\n<p>Also enshrined in GDPR law is your right to be forgotten.\nThere is another conundrum here, as we need to keep a record of anyone who has asked to be forgotten, so that we can provide proof to the ICO that we are compliant.\nThis is the hardest part of GDPR, as it\u2019s almost impossible to remove one person\u2019s details from a backup we may have of data, for instance.\nHowever, we will be keeping ourselves up-to-date with industry fixes and changes, and will do our very best to ensure you can be forgotten.\nOf course, your right to be forgotten will need to reviewed against the organisations need to keep information on you to satisfy other regulatory bodies.</p>\n<p>If you wish to act on this section of the law, please send an email to admin [at] okfn.org with the

our doing so.\nYou should read the policy carefully, especially if you have any concerns about your privacy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Warning: unless we have agreed a particular level of service with you, we make absolutely no promises about the quality or existence of any of our services .\nPlease read the sections below and our general exclusion of liability.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All use of our web services are subject to our terms for web users.\nThere are further terms if you have signed up for an account with one of our services and, if you have agreed to pay us for a service, please see the additional terms for paid-for services.\nAt the end are some general terms and definitions.</p>\n<p>If you believe there may be illegal content hosted on our web services please let us know at

free and try to make them reliable and useful, we make no promises about them.\nAll web services are certain to fail some of the time.\nWe adapt and change our services from time to time, so you may find that something that worked for you may cease to work.\nWe may also stop supplying any service, temporarily or permanently or block access to our services to anyone for any reason.</p>\n<p>If you need some guarantee of a particular service level, then please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss whether we could offer you a commercial version of any of our services (assuming one is not already available).</p>\n<p>We are not a law firm and nothing we do is intended to be taken as legal advice.\nIn particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We encourage the use of our open data commons licences but we cannot give any warranty that they will work in the way expected or should be used for any specific purpose.\nIf in doubt, you should take your own legal advice.</li>\n<li>The API supplied with our Public Domain Works project is not guaranteed to provide an answer with 100% certainty.\nCopyright law is complex and there may be obscure cases that are not handled correctly.\nIt is intended to be a starting point, not the word of God.</li>\n</ul>\nWhat you agree\n<p>You agree not to use our websites to do any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anything which is illegal either where you are in the world, or where we are.</li>\n<li>Cause nuisance to other users of our services.</li>\n<li>Interfere with the normal running of our services.</li>\n<li>Try to access our systems in a way other than those advertised by us and, in particular, to use a web crawler that does not respect the robots exclusion policy.</li>\n</ul>\nOther websites\n<p>Some of our activities are carried out on web platforms provided by third parties.\nFor example the source code for AnnotateIt is hosted on github.\nIf you make use of any service where that is the case, you are responsible for complying with any terms of service of the third party platform.</p>\nAccounts\n<p>Some of our services require you to create an account in order to make certain kinds of, or any, use of the service.\nAll our accounts are subject to the following rules.</p>\n<p>You must be at least 13 years old and a human being.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If asked for any personal details, you must answer truthfully (see our privacy policy for what we do with those details).\nYou must supply us with a valid e-mail address.</li>\n<li>You are responsible for the security of your accounts and making sure that any contact details in the account are kept up to date.\nIf we need to contact you but are unable to do so, for example because your e-mail address is no longer valid, then any consequences of that failure will be your responsibility.</li>\n<li>You must not let anyone else use your account.\nIf pressure is applied to you to do so \u2014 for example if an employer demands your username and password \u2014 please inform them that their attempt to subvert your agreement with us will mean that they have no permission to use any of our services.\nWe may take action, including criminal prosecution, if they use our services using an account they have obtained in this way.</li>\n<li>You must let us know of any unauthorised use of your account as soon as you are able to after becoming aware of it.</li>\n<li>Unless an account is associated with a paid-for service, we may suspend or terminate it at any time.\nEqually, you may close your account at any time</li>\n</ul>\nCommunity members\n<p>By registering as a community member, you are acknowledging your connection to us.\nYou are subject to any rules for community members we may publish and we may send you email messages we think appropriate for members, for example in order to poll you on some important issue.</p>\n<p>Community membership is not membership in the formal sense of membership of a company limited by guarantee.</p>\nContent and intellectual property\nWhat we do with your content\n<p>If you contribute content to any of our services, for example by commenting on a blog, or uploading data, then as a general rule you agree to licence that content to us under the same licence as prevails for that service or website.</p>\n<p>For example: any comment you make on the blog , which is licensed under a CC-BY licence, will be licensed to us under the same licence.</p>\n<p>The only exception to this policy is where a service we supply to you expressly allows a different licence, for example a private CKAN instance would contain your data under whatever licence \u2014 including no licence \u2014 you choose.</p>\nOur content\n<p>Unless otherwise stated all our services are offered under open content or data licences and you should refer to the provisions of the licence in question to find out what you are allowed to do.\nSome of our content belongs to third parties.\nMost third party data is subject to an open licence, but we cannot guarantee it.\nYou should refer to the third party if you are in doubt.</p>\nOwnership does not change\n<p>As a general rule, this agreement will not change the ownership of any intellectual property belonging to either party.\nWhere your content is used by us or vice versa both you and we would do so under a licence (see above).</p>\nPaid-for services\n<p>Any payment you have agreed to make to us is subject to any applicable taxation or similar financial imposition.\nYou are responsible for paying any additional sum imposed in this way.\nFor example, many of our services are subject to Value-Added Tax, which you are required to pay to us.<br>\nIf you have agreed to pay a sum at regular intervals (\"payment periods\") then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will only terminate the service by giving notice of at least one payment period in length;</li>\n<li>We may increase the price for the service by giving you at least one payment period's notice of the new price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may terminate a paid-for service at any time by giving us notice of termination.\nAny payment you have already made to us will not be repayable, but we will continue to supply the service \u2014 unless you ask us otherwise \u2014 until the next payment date.</p>\n<p>We may suspend a paid for service if we reasonably believe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is necessary for us to do so in order to prevent any unlawful activity;</li>\n<li>You have breached this agreement in a sufficiently serious way to justify suspending the service in order to prevent that breach.</li>\n<li>You have failed to pay us any sum of money you owe.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we do suspend a service for any of the above reasons we will take all reasonable steps to inform you promptly of what we have done and we will lift the suspension as soon as we are satisfied that the reason for the suspension no longer applies.</p>\nLiability\nIndemnities \u2014 where you may owe us\n<p>If you breach any of your obligations under this agreement and, as a result, cause us to be sued by anyone else, you will have to compensate us for any loss we have suffered as a result, which includes any costs, such as paying lawyers, or for our own time, we incur defending a claim as well as any damages awarded.</p>\n<p>If your breach causes you to be sued by someone else, you will not sue us for any loss you suffer as a result.</p>\nExclusion \u2014 what we do not owe you\n<p>We limit our liability in several different ways \u2014 all of which we believe to be fair.\nIn case any one of them is found to be unenforceable by a court, each of the following limitations of liability is separate and our liability to you is limited by all of them.</p>\n<p>All exclusions of liability are only in so far as we are allowed to do so by whatever law applies to the situation.\nFor example, the law of England and Wales prevents us from excluding our liability for any personal injury or death caused by our negligence.\nWe do not exclude such liability.<br>\nWe will not be liable for any damage that was not reasonably foreseeable at the time we made this agreement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any liability to you is limited by the amount you have paid us for a service, where:</li>\n<li>Our liability is zero for a free service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where you make periodic payments, our liability is limited to the value of the last payment you paid us.</p>\n<p>We are not liable for any loss which is indirect or consequential.\nThat includes any loss of business or profit.</p>\n<p>We exclude, in so far as we are allowed, any warranties that would be implied by law.</p>\nGeneral conditions\nThis agreement\n<p>We may update these terms and conditions at any time.\nIf we do so, we will announce the change on our blog.\nAny changes will be binding on you from the moment we announce them.<br>\nThis agreement is made under the laws of England and Wales.</p>\nBoilerplate\n<p>These final \u201cboilerplate\u201d terms of should go without saying, but we are saying them anyway just to be clear.</p>\n<p>If any part of this agreement is ineffective (for example because it is unlawful) then the rest of the agreement should be read without it.</p>\n<p>This agreement is between you and us and is not intended to give anyone else any rights.<br>\nWe may sometimes fail to enforce our rights under this agreement (for example because we decide not to, or we did not realise you were in breach of contract).\nJust because we have not enforced any of our rights, does not stop us from doing so in the future.</p>\n<p>Neither party is liable for anything which is beyond their reasonable control.</p>\n<p>If for some reason beyond Open Knowledge Foundation's reasonable control, we are unable to or it would not be commercially viable for us to, continue to supply any of our services, we may cease to supply that service, ending any agreement between us for its supply.\nIf we do so, we will return to you a fair proportion of any sum you have paid us in advance for the supply of that service, taking into account the service we have already supplied to you.</p> ", "created_at":
