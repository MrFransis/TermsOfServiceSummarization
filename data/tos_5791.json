contact us at support@doodly.com to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally.\nAny controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Website, any product, service, or software, the End User License Agreement, these Terms of Use &amp.\nSale, the Privacy Policy, or your relationship with us that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation

court having jurisdiction thereof.\nWe agree that any claim we may have against you or your business will also be subject to this arbitration provision, except as provided in Sections 18 and 19 below.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator in the English language in Ada County, Idaho, unless we both agree to conduct the arbitration by telephone or written submissions.\nThe arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in accordance

or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or

basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.\nYou and Doodly expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.\n</p>\n<p> Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within 1 year after the claim arises (the 1 year period includes the 120-day informal resolution procedures described above).\n</p>\n<p> This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to

of your account or relationship with Doodly, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer.\nIf the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply.\nIf a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.\n</p>\n<p> YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND YOUR BUSINESS WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE, AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nHOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY
