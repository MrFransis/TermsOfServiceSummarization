Service shall be deemed solely based in New York.\nand (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than New York.\nThese Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.\nThe parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce.\nNotwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16).\nThe application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\nYou agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York, New York for any actions for which Genius retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of its copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.\nYou agree that New York, New York is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration:</b> READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM GENIUS.\nFor any dispute with Genius, you agree to first contact us at terms@genius.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.\nIn the unlikely event that Genius has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, \"Claims\"), by binding arbitration by JAMS, Inc.\n(\"JAMS\"), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein.\nJAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in New York, New York, unless you and Genius agree otherwise.\nIf you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nIf you are using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS.\n(ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney's fees and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nand (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Genius from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Genius's proprietary interests.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver:</b> WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nTHIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS.\nYOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND GENIUS ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Termination</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the termination rights set forth elsewhere herein, you agree that Genius, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content (including without limitation your User Content) within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Genius believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms.\nAny suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.\nGenius may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice.\nYou agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of these Terms may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Genius may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service.\nFurther, you agree that Genius shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>User Disputes</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other User in connection with the Service and Genius will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.\nGenius reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other User of the Service or to elect to display only certain of the User content submitted in connection with a particular Genius subdomain.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Assignment</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Genius without restriction.\nAny attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>General</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Genius and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Genius with respect to the Service.\nYou also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use certain features of the Service, affiliate or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software.\nThe failure of Genius to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.\nYou agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred, unless required otherwise by applicable law.\nA printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.\nThe section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nNotices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.\nThe Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Notice for California Users</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, Users of the Service from California
