a pay per use basis.\nAny credits for free Supercharging that are given with the purchase of a vehicle, including any annual renewal of credits, expire upon the sale or transfer of the vehicle and are not transferable to any subsequent vehicle owner, or to any other vehicle.\nCredits for Supercharging expire after a set period of time and do not rollover into future periods.</p>\n<p>Pay per use billing is on a per kilowatt hour basis in jurisdictions where this is feasible, and as a service fee on a per minute basis in other jurisdictions.\nThe pay per use billing unit and rate for each location may change from time to time, and the latest information is provided in the map pin pop-up (accessible through the navigation application on your vehicle touchscreen).\nBy charging your

Updated June 2021</p> Human Rights And Conflict Minerals Policy <p>Tesla expects our suppliers to conduct their worldwide operations in responsible manner in adherence of this policy and the principles enumerated herein.\nTesla works collaboratively with our suppliers to encourage compliance with the following principles:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Legal And Regulatory Compliance</b>\n</p>\n<p>Tesla suppliers are to ensure their operations and the products and services supplied to Tesla comply with all national and other applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Conflict Minerals</b>\n</p>\n<p>Tesla's suppliers are expected to use reasonable efforts to ensure that parts and products supplied to Tesla are DRC \"conflict-free,\" meaning that such conflict minerals do not benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nConflict-free means such parts and supplies do not contain metals derived from \"conflict minerals\" which are defined as:</p> (i) columbite-tantalite (tantalum).\n(ii) cassiterite (tin).\n(iii) gold.\n(iv) wolframite (tungsten).\nand (v) any derivatives of the above.\n<br>\n<p>The goal of this policy is to ensure that Tesla's products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups through mining or mineral trading in the DRC and adjoining countries.\nTesla requires its suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks, and management systems, consistent with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, that are designed to accomplish this goal.\nTesla expects its suppliers to stay up-to-date with and to use validated conflict free smelters and refiners assessed by the Responsible Mineral Initiative and similar organizations.\nTesla performs ongoing due diligence and files annual reports with the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Human Rights</b>\n</p>\n<p>Tesla is committed to ensuring that its suppliers do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking.\nTesla does not, and will not, tolerate the use of slave or child labor in the manufacture of its products and does not, and will not, accept products or services from suppliers that engage in human trafficking in any form.\nHuman trafficking, child labor and slavery are crimes under state, federal and international law.\nThese crimes exist in countries throughout the world.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Supplier Compliance</b>\n</p>\n<p>Tesla will do the following to ensure compliance by its suppliers with this policy as required by law and as needed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluate its supply chain to address risks related to conflict minerals, human trafficking, slavery and child labor;</li>\n<li>Audit suppliers, to evaluate supplier compliance with Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;</li>\n<li>Require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Tesla products comply with the laws regarding conflict minerals, slavery, child labor and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business;</li>\n<li>Discipline employees or contractors, including potential termination of contract, who fail to meet Tesla's Human Rights and Conflict Minerals Policy;</li>\n<li>Train certain Tesla employees regarding conflict minerals, human trafficking, child labor and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the Tesla's supply chain;</li>\n<li>Investigate if Tesla has a reasonable basis to believe that a Tesla supplier is engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals.\nand</li>\n<li>Transition away from purchasing goods or services from any supplier that is believed to be engaging in human trafficking, slave or child labor, or use of conflict minerals if the supplier does not take corrective actions within a reasonable period of time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Grievance Mechanism</b>\n</p>\n<p>You may contact Tesla's Board of Directors to provide comments or to report concerns.\nPlease write to:</p>\n<p> Corporate Secretary<br> Tesla<br> 3500 Deer Creek Rd.<br> Palo Alto, CA 94304 </p>\n<p>You may submit your concern anonymously or confidentially by postal mail.\nYou may also indicate whether you are a shareholder, customer,

who, in good faith, wants to use its technology.\nTesla was created to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, and this policy is intended to encourage the advancement of a common, rapidly-evolving platform for electric vehicles, thereby benefiting Tesla, other companies making electric vehicles, and the world.\nThese guidelines provide further detail as to how we are implementing this policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Tesla\u2019s Pledge</b>\n</p>\n<p>Tesla irrevocably pledges that it will not initiate a lawsuit against any party for infringing a Tesla Patent through activity relating to electric vehicles or related equipment for so long as such party is acting in good faith.\nKey terms of the Pledge are explained below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Definition of Key Terms</b>\n</p>\n<p>\"Tesla Patents\" means all patents owned now or in the future by Tesla (other than a patent owned jointly with a third party or any patent that Tesla later acquires that comes with an encumbrance that prevents it from being subject to this Pledge).\nA list of Tesla Patents subject to the Pledge will be maintained at the following URL: https://www.tesla.com/about/legal#patent-list.</p>\n<p>A party is \"acting in good faith\" for so long as such party and its related or affiliated companies have not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>asserted, helped others assert or had a financial stake in any assertion of (i) any patent or other intellectual property right against Tesla or (ii) any patent right against a third party for its use of technologies relating to electric vehicles or related equipment.\n</li>\n<li>challenged, helped others challenge, or had a financial stake in any challenge to any Tesla patent.\nor</li>\n<li>marketed or sold any knock-off product (e.g., a product created by imitating or copying the design or appearance of a Tesla product or which suggests an association with or endorsement by Tesla) or provided any material assistance to another party doing so.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Transfer of Tesla Patents</b>\n</p>\n<p>Should Tesla ever transfer a Tesla Patent to a third party, it will do so only to a party that agrees, by means of a public declaration intended to be binding on such party, to provide the same protection that Tesla provided under the Pledge and to place the same requirement on any subsequent transferee.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Legal Effect</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Pledge, which is irrevocable and legally binding on Tesla and its successors, is a \"standstill,\" meaning that it is a forbearance of enforcement of Tesla\u2019s remedies against any party for claims of infringement for so long as such party is acting in good faith.\nIn order for Tesla to preserve its ability to enforce the Tesla Patents against any party not acting in good faith, the Pledge is not a waiver of any patent claims (including claims for damages for past acts of infringement) and is not a license, covenant not to sue, or authorization to engage in patented activities or a limitation on remedies, damages or claims.\nExcept as expressly stated in the Pledge, no rights shall be deemed granted, waived or received by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.\nFinally, the Pledge is not an indication of the value of an arms-length, negotiated license or a reasonable royalty.</p>\n<p>What this pledge means is that as long as someone uses our patents for electric vehicles and doesn\u2019t do bad things, such as knocking off our products or using our patents and then suing us for intellectual property infringement, they should have no fear of Tesla asserting its patents against them.</p>\n<p>Patent list</p> AU&nbsp;2008276398Battery charging based on cost and life CA&nbsp;2608448Method and

salvaged vehicle is a vehicle that has been declared a total loss, commonly after extensive damage caused by a crash, flooding, fire, or similar hazard, and has been (or qualifies to be) registered and/or titled by its owner as a salvaged vehicle or its equivalent pursuant to local jurisdiction or industry practice.\nSalvage registration/titling typically can never be removed from the vehicle so that all future persons understand the condition and value of the vehicle.\nTesla does not warrant the safety or operability of salvaged vehicles.\nRepairs performed to bring a salvaged vehicle back into service may not meet Tesla standards or specifications and that is why the vehicle is unsupported.\nConsequently, any failures, damages, or injuries occurring as a result of such repairs or continued operation of an unsupported vehicle are solely the responsibility of the vehicle owner.</p>\n<p>Until Tesla can confirm that the vehicle is in compliance with Tesla\u2019s safety standards and vehicle specifications, Tesla does not perform or support repairs involving the HV (high-voltage) battery systems in the vehicle because of the potential for the salvage vehicle to have sustained damage that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Makes the vehicle unsafe to drive</li>\n<li>Makes the vehicle unsafe for any repair technicians that might work on the vehicle</li>\n<li>Might damage Tesla equipment, such as Superchargers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a vehicle is classified as a salvaged vehicle:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any Tesla limited warranties and extended service agreements for the vehicle are void.<br>\n<strong>NOTE</strong>: Repairs due to recalls will be performed unless the safe repair of the vehicle is prevented either by the condition of the vehicle or by vehicle modifications not installed by Tesla.\nIf the Tesla Service Center determines that the vehicle is not safe to repair, the recall-related repair will not be performed until the customer has returned the vehicle to a condition that the Service Center determines is safe to repair.</li>\n<li>Supercharging is permanently disabled.</li>\n<li>Parts availability is not affected.\nAny Unrestricted or Over-the-Counter part may be purchased for a salvage-titled vehicle.</li>\n<li>A \u201cSalvage-Titled Vehicle HV Safety Inspection\u201d may be performed (at the customer\u2019s expense) on the vehicle to determine if the HV-related components are safe to work on or access.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about this policy, please contact a Tesla Service Center.</p> Tesla Worldwide Bribery and
