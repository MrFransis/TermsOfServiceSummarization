unless required for any of these reasons.\nand<br>\n<br>\n<strong>b)</strong> retain Personal Data in an aggregated, de-identified or otherwise anonymous form, such that there is no reliable way of identifying you from the information.</p>10.\nDisclosure of Personal Data<p>We will not sell Personal Data to anyone.\n<br>\n<br>We share Personal Data with third parties for limited purposes, such as to help us run our business and provide the Website and Service.\nThose third parties can be categorised as follows:<br>\n<br>\n<strong>a) Account Holders: </strong>At the direction of an Account Holder (through the Service) Storypark shall disclose Content (which may contain Personal Data) to other Account Holders.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The family version of the Service enables Account Holders to tag posts and Content in a way as to identify particular interests of a Child or features of a Child\u2019s development or progress.\nStorypark may be directed to disclose this Personal Data to an Authorised Viewer (such as an educator), to facilitate their understanding of the Child\u2019s progress, development, interests etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the Service will enable an Authorised Viewer to access (and upload) Sensitive Information relating to a Child, solely for the purpose of their understanding of the Child\u2019s progress, development, interests, etc.\n&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Educators may share stories from a Child Profile with Authorised Viewers (including any person invited by the Primary Account Holder to have access to that Child\u2019s stories).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stories from a Child Profile (which may include Sensitive Information of a Child) may also be shared by Authorised Viewers with other family members of a Child\u2019s Storypark community, However, Authorised Viewer\u2019s cannot disclose notes, routines or plans from a Child\u2019s Profile with any other family members of a Child's Storypark community or any other parents or families.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Educators may share group stories (which may include Sensitive information of a Child) relating to two or more Children with family members from the Storypark community for the relevant Children.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Educators may share group plans (which may include Sensitive information of a Child) with the Primary Account Holders for all Children included in the group plan.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Storypark may be directed to allow a Centre (or a network that operates a Centre) to access an Educator Portfolio and its associated Personal Data (where that Centre maintains the Centre Account to which your Educator Portfolio relates).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have no direct relationship with any person other than you, and for that reason, you are responsible for making sure you have the appropriate permission for us to disclose any Content (which may contain Personal Data) in the manner you direct through the Service.\nPlease see Part B (section 16) below which outlines your obligations in this regard.\n<br>\n<br>If you no longer want to be contacted by one of our Account Holders, please contact the Account Holder directly.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>b) Service providers:</strong> We share your Personal Data with our third party service providers and licensors of software services utilised by us in the provision of the Service, who help us provide and support our Service.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Organisations who carry out credit, fraud and other security checks;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payment processors;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hosting services;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Child Care Management System (CCMS) software as a service product providers;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Content delivery services;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IT support providers.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marketing businesses engaged by us to disseminate materials to which recipients have consented.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We limit the information we provide to third parties to the information they need to help us provide or facilitate the provision of goods and services and associated purposes.\nWe deal with third parties that are required to meet the privacy standards required by law in handling your Personal Data, and use your Personal Data only for the purposes that we give it to them.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>c) Sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation, reorganisation, or acquisition: </strong>If Storypark or substantially all of its assets were acquired by a third party, Personal Data which we hold may be one of the transferred assets (subject to the same constraints on use and disclosure as under this policy).<br>\n<br>\n<strong>d) Legal obligation: </strong>If we are under a duty or have a legal right to disclose or share Personal Data in order to comply with any legal obligation or request or investigation issued by any Government agency, or in order to enforce or apply our terms and conditions or to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our personnel or third parties.\nThis includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection, trust and safety and credit risk reduction.</p>11.\nTrans-border Personal Data flows<p>Storypark\u2019s head office is located in New Zealand, so some limited information about adult individuals (including customers) is transferred and /or stored there.\nIn respect of our responsibilities under the GDPR, the appropriate safeguard in place for such a transfer is the existence of an adequacy decision under Article 45 of the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>The vast majority of Personal Data we handle is stored and hosted in Australia.\n<strong>All Personal Data relating to Children on Storypark is hosted in Australia.\n<br>\n<br>\u200d</strong>Some limited Personal Data may be provided to companies located in the USA who offer software as a service products that process content for inclusion on the Service (for example, conversion of images and videos to make them suitable for viewing online/ through a web browser).\nThird parties located overseas are not permitted to (and are contractually obligated to not) access or use the Personal Data provided except for those limited purposes.\nWe only choose reputable service providers and have agreements with such third parties that prevent them from using or disclosing to others the Personal Data we share with them, other than as is necessary to assist us.\n<br>\n<br>In respect of the transfer of Personal Data to Australia, the USA and other countries, we will use reasonable efforts to obtain assurances from any third parties that they will safeguard personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy and all applicable Data Protection Laws.\nHowever, in providing your consent to such trans-border transfers, you acknowledge that the Data Protection Laws existing in some jurisdictions may not contain safeguards that are comparable to those contained in the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020.<br>\n<br>While the information resides outside of the territory where you reside, it may be accessible to the local courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in a foreign jurisdiction.</p>12.\nSecurity of Personal Data<p>We take all reasonable steps to protect Personal Data, including through internal and external security, restricting access to Personal Data to those who have a need to know, maintaining technological products to prevent unauthorised computer access and regularly reviewing our technology to maintain security.\nWe choose technology partners based on their security and privacy policies and practices.\n<br>\n<br>Personal Data stored in our system is protected by electronic and procedural safeguards.\nWe take reasonable precautions to protect Personal Data (and other content) from accidental loss and theft by storing it in secure data centres with off-site backups.\nCommunication between Account Holders and our servers is encrypted via industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL).\n<br>\n<br>The Service is protected by a secure and encrypted password that each Account Holder must choose themselves.\nAccount Holders should never share their passwords.\nStorypark is not responsible for any loss of data or breach of privacy if an Account Holder shares their password with someone else.\nWe do not store your password on our servers.\n<br>\n<br>Because internet transmissions cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure, you acknowledge and agree that you use the Service at your own risk.\n<br>\n<br>In case of a Security incident or any other breach of security safeguards, such as the loss of, unauthorised access to or unauthorised disclosure of Personal Data under Storypark\u2019s control, we will respond in accordance with applicable Data Protection Laws.</p>13.\nYour Rights<p>a) You have the right to access and correct your Personal Data that is held by us at anytime.\n&nbsp;Requests for such access and correction requirements can be made to the contact details in section 4 of this Privacy Policy.\n<br>\n<br>If you are a resident of the EU you also have the right to:<br>\n<br>b) request the erasure of any or all of your Personal Data;<br>\u200d<br>c) restrict or object to the processing of any or all of your Personal Data;<br>\n<br>d) request the porting of any or all your Personal Data to another organisation;<br>\n<br>e) withdraw any consent to processing that you have previously given in respect of any or all of your Personal Data.\n&nbsp;and<br>\n<br>f) lodge a complaint regarding our data processing activities as they relate to your Personal Data with the supervisory authority in your member state.\n<br>\n<br>Please note that where we are not, or are no longer, in a position to identify you within the information we hold (including because of any de-identification techniques we may have employed), then your rights as described above shall not apply.\n<br>\n<br>We will respond to any request made in respect of the above in accordance with the applicable Data Protection Laws where you are resident.\n<br>\n<br>We will respond to any request made in respect of the above without delay, but in any case within one (1) month of are quest, or two (2) months where the requests are complex or numerous (in which case, we will inform you of such delay).</p>14.\nCancelling your Account<p>If your Storypark Account terminates (for whatever reason), the Personal Data associated with it may no longer be accessible to you.\nAny Content you have posted from your Account may still be available to other Account Holders that the Content has been associated with.\nThere may continue to be residual copies of such Content due to ongoing data back-up and archiving.</p>\n<strong>Part B: Your Responsibilities</strong>15.\nUploading and transferring other people\u2019s Personal Data through the Service<p>You acknowledge and agree that, in respect of other people\u2019s Personal Data (including the Personal Data of Children) that you upload and transfer within the Service, you are acting as a joint data-controller along with Storypark in respect of such Personal Data.\n<br>\n<br>By accessing and using the Service to upload and transfer other people\u2019s

Child to be lawfully uploaded into the relevant Child Profile.<br>\n<br>Storypark may, but shall not be required to, offer through the functionality of the Service a pop-up or embedded form to allow Account Holders to give their consent, retrospectively, to the processing of their Personal Data (or the Personal Data of a Child that they are the parent or guardian of)through the Service.\nHowever, you shall not rely on any such functionality, and it is your responsibility to ensure that you obtain consent from the appropriate person(s).<br>\n<br>\n<strong>c) Withdrawn consent or objection to processing: </strong>must notify us (and remove the relevant Personal Data from the Service) without undue delay if any Account Holder fails to provide consent, withdraws their consent, or any part of their consent, or objects to any processing of Personal Data through the Service.\nThis shall include any withdrawal of consent, or objection received by you from a Child to whom the Personal Data relates;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>d) Accuracy of Personal Data:</strong> will make sure that you are frequently updating any Personal Data stored within your Account that relates to another person when requested to do so by that person;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>e) Security breach:</strong> upon becoming aware of a Security Incident, or any other breach, or suspected breach, of your security safeguards,
