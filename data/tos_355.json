dispute procedures (unless you opt out), and to waive your rights to a jury trial and to participate in any class action suit.\nFor additional terms and conditions governing a dispute between us, including how to dispute Charges assessed to you on your bill, choice of law, disclaimers of certain warranties, limitations of liabilities, and your indemnification obligations, see \u201cOther Terms Regarding Dispute Resolution\u201d below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</u>.\nYOU AND WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OR DISPUTES IN ANY WAY RELATED TO OR CONCERNING THE AGREEMENT, OUR PRIVACY NOTICE, OUR SERVICES, DEVICES OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY BILLING DISPUTES, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT</b>.\nThis includes any claims against other parties relating to Services or Devices provided or billed to you (such as our suppliers, dealers, authorized retailers, or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.\nYou and we each also agree that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, not state law, apply and govern the enforceability of this dispute resolution provision (despite the general choice of law provision set forth below).\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MUST FOLLOW THIS AGREEMENT AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES).</p>\n<p>\n<b>For Puerto Rico customers</b>, references to \"small claims court\" should be understood to mean the Puerto Rico Telecommunications Regulatory Board (\u201c<b>TRB</b>\u201d) for matters within the jurisdiction of said agency.\nSee <b>OTHER TERMS REGARDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION </b>for details on the billing dispute process in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, <b>YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION IF YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES <u>WITHIN 30 DAYS</u> FROM THE EARLIER OF THE DATE YOU PURCHASED A DEVICE FROM US OR THE DATE YOU ACTIVATED A NEW LINE OF SERVICE (the \u201cOpt Out Deadline\u201d)</b>.\nYou must opt out by the Opt Out Deadline for each line of Service.\nYou may opt out of these arbitration procedures by calling 1-866-323-4405 or online at www.T-Mobiledisputeresolution.com.\n<b>Any opt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline will not be valid and you will be required to pursue your claim in arbitration or small claims court.</b>\n</p>\n<p>For any and all disputes or claims you have, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending a written description of your claim to the address provided in the \u201cHow Do We Notify Each Other\u201d Section below.\nYou and we each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith.\nYou agree that you may not commence any arbitration or court proceeding unless you and we are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after we receive your claim description and you have made a good faith effort to resolve your claim directly with us during that time.</p>\n<p>\n<b>If we are unable to resolve your claim within 60 days despite those good faith efforts, then either you or we may start arbitration or small claims court proceedings</b>.\nTo begin arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent (see the \u201cHow Do We Notify Each Other\u201d section below) and to the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d).\nThe arbitration of all disputes will be administered by the AAA under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced, except to the extent any of those rules conflicts with our agreement in these T&amp;Cs, in which case these T&amp;Cs will govern.\nThe AAA rules are available at www.adr.org.\nIf the claims asserted in any request or demand for arbitration could have been brought in small claims court, then either you or we may elect to have the claims heard in small claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time before the arbitrator is appointed, by notifying the other party of that election in writing.\nThe arbitration of all disputes will be conducted by a single arbitrator, who shall be selected using the following procedure: (a) the AAA will send the parties a list of five candidates.\n(b) if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator from that list, each party shall return its list to the AAA within 10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates in order of preference.\n(c) the AAA shall appoint as arbitrator the candidate with the highest aggregate ranking.\nand (d) if for any reason the appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the AAA may exercise its discretion in appointing the arbitrator.\nUpon filing of the arbitration demand, we will pay or reimburse all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees.\nAn arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nIn addition, for claims under $75,000 as to which you provided notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\nExcept for claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not to seek attorneys\u2019 fees in arbitration even if permitted under applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Class Action Waiver</u>\n</b>.\n<b>YOU AND</b>\n<b>WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, MASS, OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION</b>.\nIf we believe that any claim you have filed in arbitration or in court is inconsistent with this limitation, then you agree that we may seek an order from a court determining whether your claim is within the scope of this class action waiver.\nIf a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that any part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with respect to any claim, the arbitration agreement and Class Action Waiver will not apply to that claim, but they will still apply to any and all other claims that you or we may assert in that or any other action.\n<b>If you opt out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this Class Action Waiver provision will not apply to you.\nNeither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt out requirements above.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Jury Trial Waiver</u>\n</b>.\nIf a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, <b>YOU AND WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL</b>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nWHAT IS A RATE PLAN?\n<p>Your \u201cRate Plan\u201d includes your Service allotments, for example, for minutes, messages or data, rates and other terms.\nT-Mobile may introduce access to new technologies, features, or services that you can add for an additional charge.\nIf any term in your Rate Plan conflicts with these T&amp;Cs, the term in your Rate Plan governs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nHOW WILL I BE CHARGED FOR DATA USAGE?\n<p>Data service may be included in your Rate Plan or data pass or you may be charged for data usage on a pay per use basis (\u201cData Plan\u201d).\nYour Rate Plan and/or Data Plan will contain more information about how we calculate data usage.\nYou can check your current usage by visiting my.T-mobile.com or by using a short code from your device (you can find more information about the short code at www.t-mobile.com).\nSprint customers can check current usage by logging into your account at Sprint.com, or by using the My Sprint app.\nIf you do not have a Data Plan, your Device may not be able to access data services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nHOW DO I GIVE OTHER PEOPLE ACCESS TO MY ACCOUNT?\n<p>If you want someone else to be able to access and manage your account, you can establish them as an \u201cAuthorized User,\u201d so they can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make changes to your account;</li>\n<li>Add or remove services or features to your account;</li>\n<li>Receive notices and disclosures on your behalf;</li>\n<li>Purchase Devices for use with our Service, including under an installment plan.\nand</li>\n<li>Incur Charges on your account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The easiest way to designate an Authorized User is online through your my.T-mobile.com account.\nKeep in mind that you should not share your account validation information, which includes the last four digits of your social security number or your PIN/passcode.\nAn Authorized User will need to verify identity before we provide access to account information.\nWhen calling us, this requires presentation of the last four digits of the primary account holder\u2019s social security number or the account PIN/passcode.\nThis information is sensitive so take steps to protect it.\nWe will treat presentation of the proper account validation information as authorized access to an account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nWHERE, HOW, AND WHEN DOES MY SERVICE WORK?\n<p>These T&amp;Cs describe the experience you can expect on our networks, including information about our reasonable network management practices, and the experience on our roaming partners\u2019 networks.\nPlease check our coverage maps, which approximate our anticipated coverage area outdoors.\nYour experience on our networks may vary and change without notice depending on a variety of factors.\nYou agree that we are not liable for problems relating to Service availability or quality.\nTo provide the best possible experience for the most possible customers on T-Mobile or Sprint branded rate plans, for many Rate Plans, we prioritize the data usage of a small percentage of our heavy data users, below that of other customers.\nThis threshold number is specified in your Rate Plan and is also periodically evaluated and may change over time.\nWe also prioritize the data of customers who choose certain Rate Plans after the data for other T-Mobile or Sprint branded rate plans, but before customers who are prioritized as heavy data users.\nCustomers whose data is prioritized lower may notice speeds lower than customers with higher priority in times and locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources.\nSee your selected service or visit our Open Internet page at the link below for details.\nWe prioritize smartphone and mobile internet (tablet) over Smartphone Mobile HotSpot (tethering) traffic on our network.\nWe utilize streaming video optimization technology in our networks to help minimize data consumption while also improving the service experience for all customers.\nFor example, a small number of Rate Plans experience video optimization via the Binge On feature.\nSome qualifying video providers may choose to opt-out of the Binge On program.\nFor a list of opt-out providers visit http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html#.\nThe Binge On optimization technology is not applied to the video services of these providers, and high-speed data consumption will continue as if Binge On were not enabled.\nAdditionally, we may implement other network practices, to ensure optimized network performance as technologies evolve.\nFor example, some plans may offer gaming or audio streaming at standard or at high definition.\nOur Open Internet Policy, located at www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet, includes important information on these topics as well as information on commercial terms and performance characteristics (such as expected speed, latency and network practices.)</p>\n<p>\n<b>Using Our Networks</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>WILL MY SERVICE VARY? WHAT FACTORS MAY AFFECT MY SERVICE?</b>\n</p>\n<p>As our customer, your actual Service area, network availability, coverage and quality may vary based on a number of factors, including your selected service, network capacity, terrain, weather, if you are on a private or public Wi-Fi network, using a non-T-Mobile device, or if your Device no longer supports network technologies compatible with or available on T-Mobile\u2019s network.\nOutages and interruptions in Service may occur, and speed of Service varies.\nDevices also have varying speed capabilities and may connect to different networks depending on technology.\nEven within coverage areas and with broadband-capable devices, network changes, traffic volume, outages, technical limitations, signal strength, obstructions, weather, public safety needs, and other conditions may impact speeds and service availability.</p>\n<p>We engineer our network to provide consistent high-speed data service, but at times and at locations where the number of customers using the network exceeds available network resources, customers will experience reduced data speeds.\nIn those cases, customers who choose certain rate plans may notice speeds lower than customers on other T-Mobile or Sprint branded rate plans, which are prioritized higher on our networks.\nFurther, to provide the best possible on-device experience for the most possible customers on T-Mobile or Sprint branded plans and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we may, without advance notice, take any actions necessary to manage our network on a content-agnostic basis, including prioritizing all on-device data over Smartphone Mobile HotSpot (tethering) data and, for the vast majority of Rate Plans, further prioritizing the data usage of a small percentage of heavy data users (as defined in their Rate Plans), below that of all other customers in times and locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, for the remainder of the billing cycle.\nThis threshold number is periodically evaluated and may change over time.</p>\n<p>Where the network is lightly loaded in relation to available capacity, a customer whose data is prioritized below other data traffic will notice little, if any, effect from having lower priority.\nThis will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations.\nAt times and locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, these customers will likely see significant reductions in data speeds, especially if they are engaged in data-intensive activities.\nCustomers should be aware that these practices may occasionally result in speeds below those typically experienced on our 5G or LTE networks.\nWe constantly work to improve network performance and capacity, but there are physical and technical limits on how much capacity is available, and in constrained locations the frequency of heavy loading in relation to available capacity may be greater than in other locations.\nWhen network loading goes down or the customer moves to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the customer\u2019s speeds will likely improve.\nVisit www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet for details and for current data amount subject to this practice.</p>\n<p>\n<b>*CAN I ROAM ON MY DEVICE?</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Domestic Roaming.</u>\n</b> Your Device may connect to another provider\u2019s network (\u201cOff-Net\u201d).\nThis may happen even when you are within the T-Mobile coverage area.\nCheck your Device to determine if you are Off-Net.\nPlease do not abuse this.\nwe may limit or terminate your Service if you do.\nYour device may also connect to another provider\u2019s secured Wi-Fi network.\nSee <b>WHAT ARE THE PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED USES FOR MY DEVICE AND THE SERVICE?</b> section for additional info.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<b>International Roaming &amp.\nDialing.</b>\n</u> Availability and features offered for international roaming and dialing vary depending on your Rate Plan and Device.\nAll countries may not be available for roaming, and available countries may change from time to time.\nvisit http://www.t-mobile.com/optional-services/roaming.html for more information about which countries are currently available for roaming.\nWhether roaming internationally or making and sending international calls and messages while in the U.S.\n(or Puerto Rico), you may be charged international rates (including for voicemails left for you and for data usage).\nThis includes per-minute rates for calls, and per-minute rates for calls transferred to your voicemail, and the relevant data rates for data usage.\nYou may be charged for more than one call for unanswered calls that are forwarded to voicemail regardless of whether the calls result in actual voicemail messages being left for you and regardless of whether your Device is on or off.\nDifferent rates and rounding increments apply in different countries.\nFor information on international access, rates, services, and coverage, visit http://www.t-mobile.com/optional-services/roaming.html.\nWhile roaming internationally, your data throughput may be reduced, and your Service may be otherwise limited or terminated at any time without notice.\nYou are responsible for complying with U.S.\nExport Control laws and regulations, and the import laws and regulations of foreign countries when traveling internationally with your Device.\nThe availability of, and access to, emergency calling services (e.g., 911 in the U.S.), may vary by country.\nYou should familiarize yourself with how to access these services before using your handset for international roaming.\nSee <b>WHAT ARE THE PERMITTED AND PROHIBITED USES FOR MY DEVICE AND THE SERVICE?</b> section for additional information about international roaming.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Streaming Video</b>\n</p>\n<p>We deploy streaming video optimization technology in our network, which also helps to ensure that available network capacity can be utilized to provide a good service experience for the maximum number of customers.\nThe optimization technology is intended to manage data usage on the network, reduce the risk of streaming video stalling and buffering on mobile devices, and reduce the amount of data consumed for streaming video, making room for other users to enjoy higher speeds and a better network experience overall.\nVideo optimization occurs only to data streams that are identified by our packet-core network as video or where the video provider has chosen to establish protocols to self-optimize their video.\nWhile many changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on a user\u2019s Device.\nIn some instances, video optimization may also identify and treat downloads of video files as if they were real-time video streams.\nHowever, the T-Mobile network offers content providers a way to opt-in to a protocol to help identify video downloads and ensure they are not treated as streaming video.\nCustomers may have Rate Plans where video optimization is delivered at DVD quality (typically 480p), with the ability to add a feature where video streams at speeds that provide HD video capability (typically 1080p).\nAlternatively, customers may have Rate Plans that offer video optimization as a customer-controlled feature (e.g., \u201cBinge On\u201d) to toggle on or off DVD-quality video optimization.\nSome qualifying video providers may choose to opt-out of the Binge On program, see listing at http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html#.\nThe Binge On optimization technology is not applied to the video services of these providers, and high-speed data consumption will continue as if Binge On were not enabled.\nFor more information about video optimization, visit our Open Internet Policy located at www.T-Mobile.com/OpenInternet.</p> *HOW WILL I BE BILLED FOR USE OF THE SERVICES?\n<p>You agree to pay all Charges we assess and bill you or that were accepted or processed through all Devices on your account.\nYou agree to provide us with accurate and complete billing and tax related information and to report all changes within 30 days of the change.\nYou will receive an electronic (paperless) bill unless you tell us you want a paper bill.\nYou have the option of switching to a paper bill at no cost to you by changing your billing preferences at www.my.T-Mobile.comor by contacting Customer Care.\nFor more information about paperless billing, please visit www.t-mobile.com/billterms.</p>\n<p>Your Device can be used to purchase services and products from third parties, and Charges for these purchases may be included on your T-Mobile bill.\nFor no additional cost you can block third party charges from being included on your T-Mobile bill by logging into your account at www.my.T-Mobile.com or calling Customer Care.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Off-Rate Plan Charges.</b> You may have to pay extra for calls to some numbers (e.g.\nconference &amp.\nchat lines, broadcast, calling card, international, 900 or 976 calls, etc.).</p>\n<p>Here is more information about how we bill for calls, data usage and messaging, Wi-Fi usage, third party charges, taxes, and surcharges.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Usage</u>\n</b>.\nAirtime usage is measured from the time the network begins to process a call (before the phone rings or the call is answered) through its termination of the call (after you hang up).\nFor voice calls, we round up any fraction of a minute to the next full minute.\nDepending upon your Rate Plan, data usage may be rounded at the end of each data session, at the end of your billing cycle, and/or at the time you switch data plans.\nYou may be charged for more than one call/message when you use certain features resulting in multiple inbound or outbound calls/messages (such as call forwarding, call waiting, voicemail, conference calling, and multi-party messaging).\nYou will be charged for text, instant or picture messages, and email whether read or unread, sent or received, solicited or unsolicited.\nWe use filters to block spam messages, but we do not guarantee that you will not receive spam or other unsolicited messages.\nAdditional blocking options are available at www.my.T-Mobile.com.\nMost usage and Charges incurred during a billing cycle will be included in your bill for that cycle.\nSome usage and Charges may be delayed to a later billing cycle, which may cause you to exceed Rate Plan allotments in a later billing cycle.\nUnused Rate Plan allotments expire at the end of your billing cycle.\nYou may be billed additional Charges for certain features and services.\nCharges for Wi-Fi usage may vary.\nsee your Rate Plan for more details.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Taxes</u>.</b> You agree to pay all taxes and fees imposed by governments or governmental entities.\nWe may not give advance notice of changes to these charges.\nTo determine taxes &amp.\nfees, we use the street address you identified as your Place of Primary Use (\u201cPPU\u201d), unless the tax laws require use of a different address in which case we utilize the best information available to us to determine the correct address.\nThe PPU for <b>Puerto Rico customers</b> must be in Puerto Rico.\nIf you did not identify the correct PPU, or if you provided an address, such as a PO Box, that is not a recognized street address, does not allow us to identify the applicable taxing jurisdiction(s), or does not reflect the Service area associated with your telephone number, you may be assigned a default location for tax purposes.\nExcept as may be otherwise required by law, in the event you dispute your PPU or the location we assigned you and the resulting taxes or fees applied on your bill, you must request a refund of the disputed tax or fee within 60 days of the date of our bill containing such tax or fee.\nRegardless of any Rate Plan guarantee, taxes and fees may change from time to time without notice.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Surcharges</u>.</b> You agree to pay all surcharges applicable to your Rate Plan.\nSurcharges are not mandated or imposed on you by law, they are T-Mobile Charges that are determined, collected, and retained by us.\nThe components and component amounts of the Surcharges are subject to change without notice.\nSurcharges include charges, costs, fees, and certain taxes that we incur to provide Services (and are not government taxes or fees imposed directly on our customers).\nExamples include general and administrative fees (such as certain costs we incur to provide Service), as well as governmental-related assessments (such as Federal or State Universal Service fees, regulatory or public safety charges, environmental fees, and gross receipts taxes).\nSurcharges assessed to you will vary depending on the type of Service and the Rate Plan you have.&nbsp;Surcharges may change from time to time without notice regardless of any Rate Plan guarantee (and subject to our 14-day notice policy if changes to your Service or Rate Plan will have a material adverse effect on you).\nSurcharges will apply whether or not you benefit from the programs, activities, or services included in the Surcharge.\nWhen Surcharges are assessed in connection with your Service, you can find the Surcharges detailed in either the \u201cTaxes, Fees &amp.\nSurcharges\u201d, \u201cT-Mobile Fees and Charges\u201d or the \u201cOther Charges\u201d sections of your bill or at www.myT-Mobile.com.</p>\n<p>Other Fees.\nWe may charge activation, prepayment, reactivation, program, or other fees to establish, change, or maintain Services, Certain transactions may also be subject to a charge (for example, convenience payment, changing phone numbers, handset upgrades, etc.).\nWe will tell you if any of these fees apply to your requested transaction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nWHAT IF I DON\u2019T PAY ON TIME?\n<p>We may charge a late fee of up to the highest amount allowed by law.\nWe may also charge a returned payment fee at the highest amount permissible by law.&nbsp;We may restrict your payment methods to cashier\u2019s check, money order, or other similar secure forms of payment at any time for good reason.\nIf you fail to pay on time and we refer your account to a third party for collection, a collection fee will be assessed by T-Mobile and will be due at the time of the referral to the third party.\nThe fee will be calculated as a percentage of the amount due to the extent permitted, or not otherwise prohibited, by applicable law.\nIf we accept late or partial payments, you still must pay us the full amount you owe, including late fees.\nWe will not honor limiting notations you make on or with your checks.\nLate payment, non-payment and/or collection fees are intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of our actual costs resulting from late payments and non-payments by our customers.\nthese costs are not readily ascertainable and are difficult to predict or calculate at the time that these fees are set.\nYou and we each agree that if you fail to timely pay amounts due, we may assign your account for collection, and the collection agency may pursue, in small claims court, claims limited strictly to the collection of the past due amounts and any interest or costs of collection permitted by law or this Agreement.\nIf your account is unpaid or otherwise not in good standing, your service may be reduced, suspended, or terminated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n*DOES T-MOBILE CHECK MY CREDIT?\n<p>Yes, for many of our products and services.\nWe may get information about your credit history from credit-reporting agencies, which may affect your credit rating.\nWe may report information about your account to credit bureaus.\nLate payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.\nWe may place a temporary or permanent account spending limit (ASL) on your account to limit the amount you can charge, regardless of when payment on those charges is due, and we may suspend your Services without prior notice if your account balance reached the ASL, even if your account is not past due.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nAM I REQUIRED TO MAKE A DEPOSIT?\n<p>We may require you to make a deposit or prepayment for Services.\nWe can apply deposits, payments, or prepayments in any order to any amounts you owe us on any account.\nThis deposit is refundable, and will be applied as a credit to your account along with interest as may be required by law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nCAN T-MOBILE ACCESS MY DEVICE?\n<p>We may remotely change software, systems, applications, features or programming on

network.\nThis allows federal, state, and local government agencies to send alerts about local emergencies to T-Mobile customers in specifically defined geographic areas.\nWireless alert capable handsets with appropriate notification settings are required for the service There is no additional charge for these wireless emergency alerts.\nFor details visit www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/safety/wireless-emergency-alerts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n911 ACCESS\n<p>\n<b>PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THE INFORMATION BELOW.\nIT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING LIMITATIONS OF 911 FUNCTIONALITY.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THESE LIMITATIONS AND AGREE TO SHARE THESE LIMITATIONS WITH ANYONE WHO MAY USE YOUR SERVICE TO PLACE CALLS OR SEND TEXTS.</b>\n</p>\n<p>911 services are provided by your state and local government.\nT-Mobile handsets are capable of making calls to 911 in the United States, and 911 access is available to customers regardless of your Rate Plan.\nThe handset must have battery power and network connectivity to complete a 911 call.\nAlthough T-Mobile is often capable of communicating your phone number and/or current location to a public safety answering point (\u201c911 Communications Center\u201d), in some cases, 911 Communications Center operators may not know your phone number or have information about your current location.\nAs a result, when making 911 calls, you should provide your contact information and current location.\nOther third-party entities are involved in connecting a 911 call and T-Mobile is not solely responsible for determining which 911 Communications Center your 911 call may be routed to.\nIf you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 911 location services while the port is in process.\nIf you are outside the U.S., you may have to dial a different number than 911 to call emergency services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Wi-Fi Calling</u>.</b> Wi-Fi Calling services use a broadband internet connection to make calls, including &nbsp;calls to 911.\nCalls to 911 using Wi-Fi Calling operate differently than 911 calls made over a cellular network or a landline phone.\nIf possible, use a cellular connection or a landline phone to place any 911 calls.\nIf a cellular connection is available when you a place a 911 call, your handset will make the 911 call using the handset\u2019s native dialer over the cellular connection to improve call quality and location accuracy even if you have Wi-Fi Calling services enabled.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you first enable Wi-Fi Calling on T-Mobile, you must provide us with the primary street address at which the Wi-Fi Calling service will be used (\u201cYour E911 Registered Address\u201d).\nIf you call 911 over Wi-Fi, we may transmit Your E911 Registered Address to the 911 Communications Center that answers the call, and it may be used to help emergency responders locate you.\nHowever, because of the limitations associated with Wi-Fi 911 calling, including the fact that the broadband internet connection utilized may be supplied by a third-party unaffiliated with T-Mobile, you should provide the 911 Communications Center with your contact information and current location.\n<b>You agree to update Your E911 Registered Address before you use the Wi-Fi Calling service at a location different from Your E911 Registered Address</b>.\nYou can update Your E911 Registered Address by accessing your MyT-Mobile.com account or by contacting T-Mobile Customer Care.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>Text-to-911</u>.</b> Text-to-911 service may be available in some locations where T-Mobile service is provided.\nThis is dependent on your local 911 Communication Center\u2019s ability to receive text messages.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>TTY Calls to 911</u>.&nbsp;</b>Calls to 911 from a TTY will not work when using Wi-Fi Calling or Voice-over-LTE (\u201cVoLTE\u201d).\nIf you cannot make a voice call to 911, T-Mobile recommends that you use an internet-based Telecommunications Relay Service such as Video Relay Service, IP Relay Service, or IP Captioned Telephone Service.\nT-Mobile Real-Time Text (\u201cRTT\u201d) technology is also available on T-Mobile\u2019s network and can be used on select devices to contact 911.\nFor more information, see www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/accessibility-policy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<u>VoIP Services</u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Some T-Mobile voice services, including Wi-Fi Calling services, utilize Voice over Internet Protocol (\u201cVoIP\u201d) technology.\nVoIP telephony is fundamentally different from traditional telephone service and has inherent limitations.\nVoIP services, including 911 calling, may be unavailable or limited in some circumstances.\nIf possible, use a cellular connection to place any 911 calls.</p>\n<p>911 functionality for T-Mobile VoIP services may be impaired or unavailable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you use the VoIP Service in a location other than at Your E911 Registered Address;</li>\n<li>If there is a problem with the broadband network utilized, including network congestion, network, equipment, power failure, another technical problem, or during system updates or upgrades.\nand</li>\n<li>If you have lost electrical power.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before using any T-Mobile VoIP service, you must provide us with Your E911 Registered Address.\nIf you call 911 using a T-Mobile VoIP service, we may transmit Your E911 Registered Address to the 911 Communications Center that answers the call, and it may be used to help emergency responders locate you.\n<b>You agree to update Your E911 Registered Address before you use your T-Mobile VoIP service at a different location</b>.\nYou can update your E911 Registered Address by accessing your MyT-Mobile.com account or by contacting T-Mobile Customer Care.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances when using a T-Mobile VoIP service, we may not be able to provide 911 Communications Centers with your correct current location.\nIf you make a 911 call using a T-Mobile VoIP service, you should always provide the 911 Communications Center your contact information and current location.</p>\n<p>In some limited circumstances, such as when a user makes a call from an area not covered by the 911 network, users may have limited access, or no access, to either basic 911 or E911.\nIf the user does not have access to either basic 911 or E911, calls to 911 using T-Mobile VoIP services will be sent to a national emergency call center.\nA trained agent at the national emergency call center should ask for the name, telephone number and location of the user calling 911, and then contact the local 911 Communications Center to request help for the user.</p>\n<p>\n<b>PARENTAL CONTROLS</b>\n<br>\nWe offer services that help you to monitor and filter, or restrict, internet access to minors.\nSee T-Mobile.com for

terms and conditions apply to T-Mobile's Broadband Internet Access Services?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Broadband Internet Access Services are subject to the&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;Terms and Conditions at&nbsp;https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/legal/terms-and-conditions.\nSpecific information about our Broadband Internet Access Services can be found under the heading \"Using Our Network.\" Certain uses of our network are also prohibited as described in our Terms and Conditions under the heading \"Examples of Permitted and Prohibited Uses of the Services and Your Device.\" Features of E-Rate and other government or enterprise customers' use of&nbsp;T-Mobile's&nbsp;Broadband Internet Access Services, including data prioritization, may also be governed by an applicable rate plan terms sheet, government contract, or Major Account Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What data plans and pricing does T-Mobile offer?</b>\n</p>\n<p>T-Mobile&nbsp;offers mobile Broadband Internet Access Services for smartphones, basic phones, tablets, netbooks, USB modems,&nbsp;mobile hotspot devices and other wireless devices over our 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G broadband networks.\nYour data plan may feature a designated allotment of high-speed data, after which your data speed may be reduced or your data access may be suspended for the remainder of the billing cycle.\nIf your data plan features a designated allotment of high-speed data, certain uses of the network may not count against that allotment.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Your plan includes access to the technologies, features, and services that were available and that you purchased when you first activated your current rate plan.&nbsp.\nYou may have temporary access to new services while they are being tested or made available for purchase.&nbsp.\nTemporary access to some new technologies, services, or features (e.g.\nadvanced 5G use cases) may provide noticeable network experience benefits, like significantly increased speeds, lower latency, or other performance improvements.&nbsp.\nYour temporary access may end at any time, but we may begin offering access for purchase.&nbsp.\nFor example, T-Mobile&nbsp;is leading the industry in introducing new messaging capabilities which allow you to send larger file attachments and have bigger chat groups.&nbsp.\nT-Mobile&nbsp;initially gave some users access to this new messaging service whether they had a data plan or not.\nbut going forward, you may need to have a data plan or feature to use this new type of messaging and the data used to send and receive them may count towards your data allotments and the prioritization threshold for heavy data users.&nbsp.\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Many of our plans include video optimization features which, when connected to the cellular network, deliver a DVD-quality (up to 1.5 Mbps, typically 480p) video experience with minimal buffering while streaming.\nCustomers may choose a plan where DVD-quality is always enabled (Magenta), with the option to add on a feature where video streams at speeds that provide HD video capability (typically 1080p) on-device (HD Day Pass).\nWe also offer a feature or rate plan with up to Ultra HD video capability (max 4K) both on-device and via tethering (Magenta<sup>\u00ae</sup> MAX).\nCustomers may also have plans that offer&nbsp;HD video capability (typically 1080p), or that have video optimization as a customer-controlled feature that can toggle on or off DVD-quality video at any time (\"Binge On\"), so that when enabled, their high-speed data lasts longer.\nSome qualifying video providers may choose to self-optimize their video content or opt-out of the Binge On program, see&nbsp;listing.\nThe Binge On optimization technology is not applied to the video services of these providers and high-speed data consumption will continue as if Binge On were not enabled.\nIn some instances, video optimization may also identify and treat downloads of video files as if they were real-time video streams.\nHowever, T-Mobile offers content providers a way to opt-in to a protocol to help identify video downloads and ensure they are not treated as streaming video.\nAdditional information, including technical criteria for content provider participation in the Binge On program or video file download protocol, is found&nbsp;here.\nCustomers who have plans that are no longer for sale may have different video features available, and should check&nbsp;www.myT-Mobile.com&nbsp;for more information.</p>\n<p>For more information about our current data plans

Plans&nbsp.\n(https://business.t-mobile.com)</p>\n<p>Schools and libraries seeking to participate in the E-Rate program may be eligible to purchase Broadband Internet Access Services under existing contracts between T-Mobile&nbsp;and government agencies.\nSchools and libraries interested in learning about eligibility to purchase under these contracts and the Broadband Internet Access Services available under these contracts should contact their account representative.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What speeds and performance can T-Mobile-branded Broadband Internet Access Services customers expect? Where are these speeds available?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Many factors affect the speed and performance that customers experience, including the programs running on the device, proximity to a cell site, the capacity of the cell site, weather, the surrounding terrain, use inside a building or moving vehicle, radio frequency interference, how many other customers are attempting to use the same spectrum resources, any high-speed data allotment, the rate plans or features you select, and uses that affect your network prioritization, such as whether you are using Smartphone Mobile HotSpot (tethering) or if you are a Heavy Data User.\nFor most T-Mobile-branded rate plans, a \"Heavy Data User\" is defined as a customer using more than 50GB of data&nbsp;(100GB of data for new Magenta plans activated beginning February 24, 2021) in a billing cycle.\nThe threshold number is periodically evaluated across our rate plans and brands to manage network traffic and deliver a good experience&nbsp;to all customers while offering a range of customer choices.\nYou can always check the threshold amount for a rate plan by speaking with a representative, review our rate cards or T-Mobile.com, &nbsp;or by logging in to my.t-mobile.com, or the T-Mobile app.\nThe term \"Heavy Data User\" does not apply to customers on&nbsp;Magenta MAX, a new customer choice we are offering as we explore the expanding capacity of our 5G network, or on a small number of T-Mobile-branded business and government-oriented plans, which are not subject to a threshold.</p>\n<p>In addition, many T-Mobile plans use video streaming optimization when connected to the cellular network to deliver a DVD-quality (up to 1.5 Mbps, typically 480p) video experience with minimal buffering while streaming.&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;plans optimize data streams that are identified by our packet-core network as video.\nvideo providers may also choose to establish protocols to self-optimize their video.&nbsp;As described above, customers may also have selected other video experiences, up to and including the Ultra HD video capability (max 4K) &nbsp;on Magenta MAX.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, we prioritize network data by plan and brand to deliver a range of customer choice points at great values.&nbsp.\nData for customers on most T-Mobile-branded plans (and for customers on Sprint-branded plans while using the T-Mobile network), is prioritized before the data of customers on Essentials plans and Metro by T-Mobile or Assurance Wireless-branded plans.&nbsp.\nMobile internet plans offered after December 12, 2020 with 30GB or more data per month, and Project 10Million and some other education-focused mobile internet plans, are prioritized next.&nbsp.\nThe vast majority of customers on T-Mobile-branded, Sprint-branded, Metro by T-Mobile-branded, and Assurance Wireless-branded plans receive higher priority than the small fraction of customers who are Heavy Data Users on their rate plan, who are prioritized last on the network after exceeding the relevant threshold for the current billing cycle.&nbsp.\nT-Mobile Home Internet (available in select locations) customers receive the same network prioritization as Heavy Data Users, but should be less likely to experience congestion because the equipment is stationary and available in limited areas.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>What is the impact of network prioritization?</b>\n</p>\n<p>As described in more detail below, customers may notice reduced speeds in comparison to customers with a higher priority during network congestion.</p>\n<p>Customer devices also have varying speed capabilities and may connect to different networks depending on technology.\nEven within coverage areas and with broadband-capable devices, network changes, traffic volume, outages, technical limitations, signal strength, obstructions, weather, and other conditions may impact speeds and service availability.\nYour network experience and access may also be impacted if you fail to pay amounts you owe T-Mobile.</p>\n<p>Additionally,&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;offers other services to its customers that use the same network infrastructure and resources as its broadband internet access services and are given priority over other traffic on the network.\nThese other services currently include calling-related services: Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP), Voice over LTE (VoLTE), and Video over LTE (ViLTE).\nmore may be added, e.g., to serve public safety needs.\nThese services may affect the availability of network resources for consumer or enterprise broadband internet access services, which may be noticeable in times of congestion.\nSimilarly, Wireless Priority Service traffic may preempt other traffic during times of extreme congestion, which means that in rare cases we may interrupt an active data or voice session to support public safety needs.</p> Speed and Latency<br> Speed\n<p>The term \"speed\" is commonly used as a shorthand way to describe the rate at which a particular broadband Internet access service can transmit data.\nThis rate (or speed) is typically measured in the number of kilobits or megabits transmitted in one second (Kbps or Mbps).\nSome applications like email or basic web browsing do not require a high-data speed to function very well, while other activities like high-definition video streaming or transferring large data files are better experienced with higher data speeds.</p>\nLatency\n<p>Latency, also known as delay, is the amount of time from when a data packet is sent to when it is received.\nFor Broadband Internet Access Services, latency is usually expressed as the round-trip time in milliseconds (\"ms\") that it takes for a data packet to travel between two end points on the Internet (from point A to point B and then back to point A).\nSome applications, such as email, can tolerate a substantial amount of latency without any noticeable impact on the application's performance, while other applications, such as real-time video conferencing, require lower latency to function properly.</p>\n<p>Based on internal analysis and projections from third-party, crowd-sourced data and subject to the factors described above and below, T-Mobile expects T-Mobile-branded customers (and Sprint-branded customers roaming on the T-Mobile network)&nbsp;with broadband-capable devices and qualifying service will experience the following speeds and latency on our 5G and&nbsp;4G LTE networks.\nThese ranges are projections based on roughly the 25th and 75th percentiles of network tests.</p>\n<p>5G Network (On-Device):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download speeds:&nbsp;Typically between 38 \u2013 111 Mbps</li>\n<li>Upload speeds:&nbsp;Typically between 10 \u2013 34 Mbps</li>\n<li>Latency: Typically between 21 \u2013 35 ms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>5G Network (Wireless Home Internet):<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download speeds: Typically between 37 \u2013 110 Mbps</li>\n<li>Upload speeds: Typically between 8 \u2013 24 Mbps</li>\n<li>Latency: Typically between 21 \u2013 35 ms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>T-Mobile will provide additional information here regarding speed and latency percentiles as the 5G network is further deployed and more crowd-sourced user data is collected.\nPlease review this page for updated information as the 5G rollout is ongoing.</p>\n<p>4G LTE Network (On-Device):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download Speed:&nbsp;Typically between 9 \u2013 47 Mbps</li>\n<li>Upload Speed:&nbsp;Typically between 4 \u2013 20 Mbps</li>\n<li>Latency:&nbsp;Typically between 30 \u2013 50 ms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4G LTE Network (Via Smartphone Mobile HotSpot/Tethering, for Plans Including 4G LTE Tethering, and for our Mobile Internet plans offered after December 12, 2020 with 30GB or more per month, and Project 10Million and some of other education Mobile Internet plans):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download Speed:&nbsp;Typically between 5 \u2013 31 Mbps</li>\n<li>Upload Speed:&nbsp;Typically between 3 \u2013 15 Mbps</li>\n<li>Latency:&nbsp;Typically between 30 \u2013 50 ms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4G LTE Network (Wireless Home Internet):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Download speeds: Typically between 30 \u2013 115 Mbps</li>\n<li>Upload speeds: Typically between 6 \u2013 23 Mbps</li>\n<li>Latency: Typically between 26 \u2013 45 ms<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These ranges represent network performance nationally and may differ from future network conditions or from what you purchased as part of your current rate plan when you first activated it.\nAs described above, your experience may also differ based on, e.g., your choice of rate plan and device,&nbsp;or the number of devices connected to the router in the case of Home Internet.\nYou may occasionally experience speeds, latency, or other network capabilities outside the ranges available as part of your service.</p>\n<p>T-Mobile&nbsp;constantly works to improve performance on its network and to pursue advanced and next-generation technologies and services.\nFor example,&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;is in the process of deploying its 5G network, including layering millimeter wave, mid-band, and low-band spectrum over the LTE network, and rolling out and low-band 5G.&nbsp;Currently,&nbsp;T-Mobile's&nbsp;5G millimeter wave network is available in select areas (see&nbsp;https://www.t-mobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g#maps).\nThe low-band 5G network is available nationwide, although coverage may not be available in some areas (see&nbsp;https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/5g-coverage-map).\nDevices operating on&nbsp;T-Mobile's&nbsp;nationwide 5G network may use multi-band dual connectivity.\ncustomers with 5G-compatible devices may receive service via both&nbsp;T-Mobile's&nbsp;4G LTE network and its 5G network to support their connectivity.</p>\n<p>In recent years,&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;has aggressively built out its high-speed data networks so nearly all customers have regular access to high speeds.&nbsp.\nIn those rare instances where customers are not able to receive an LTE/5G signal,&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;provides other connections (2G, 3G, and 4G HSPA+) in many areas.&nbsp.\nThese connections are used by the small percentage of customers without LTE/5G-capable devices or, in limited cases, when customers with LTE/5G-capable devices are unable to connect to the LTE network.&nbsp;T-Mobile may limit activations of new devices on these older technologies as we transition our network to newer technologies.\nsee a sales representative for the latest options.\nBased on internal and crowd-sourced testing, we expect T-Mobile-branded customers (and Sprint-branded customers roaming on the T-Mobile network) with broadband-capable devices during use of these older technologies to typically experience average download speeds of 1.5 Mbps, average upload speeds of 230 Kbps, and latency between 60 and 180 ms.\nThe typical customer experience on&nbsp;T-Mobile's&nbsp;older networks is good for streaming audio, email, and web browsing.</p>\n<p>Some plans may include maximum speeds for some services.\nThe Magenta plan includes a set amount of high-speed tethering, after which tethering usage continues at a maximum of 600kbps (3G speeds).\nThe&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;Essentials plan includes tethering at a maximum of 600 kbps.\nCustomers may choose to activate an add-on feature for a set amount of high-speed tethering data.\nWearables plans provide a maximum of 600 kbps.\nSee your plan for details.</p>\n<p>For coverage information relating to specific geographic areas, see our&nbsp;coverage map.</p>\nNote\n<p>To access a given network technology (e.g., low-band 5G), you must have a compatible device and be within the coverage area for that service (e.g., a low-band 5G device in a low-band 5G coverage area).\nLearn more about device capabilities by reviewing your user manual or find information about devices here (https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phones).\nAdditionally, a 5G-compatible SIM card may be required to access the T-Mobile 5G network.\nAs noted above, devices operating on&nbsp;T-Mobile's&nbsp;nationwide 5G network may in some areas use both 4G LTE and 5G signals and dynamically route traffic between the signals&nbsp;to support your connectivity.&nbsp.\nThe network architecture providing dual connectivity could result in instances where your device indicates a 5G connection even though you are temporarily utilizing only 4G LTE.\nAs 5G technology develops, devices will be able to experience direct and continuous 5G in more places.</p>\nHow can I measure my data speeds on the network?\n&nbsp.\n<p>If your data plan features a designated allotment of high-speed data, data used by certain speed measurement applications will not count against that high-speed data allotment to provide accurate and reliable information about network performance without consuming large amounts of your data.&nbsp;See the full list here.\nIf your data plan includes data use at reduced speed after you have used your plan's monthly allotment of high-speed data, your data speed will be limited (typically to 64 kbps or 128 kbps) for the remainder of your billing cycle once you have used your allotted high-speed data.\nThe results from some speed measuring applications may show current network speeds, rather than the reduced speed that is currently available to you.\nSpeed measurement applications other than the ones&nbsp;listed here&nbsp;will show your reduced speed.\nIf you use speed tests other than the ones&nbsp;listed here&nbsp;prior to reaching your monthly high-speed data allotment, use of those applications may count against your data allotment.</p>\nHow does T-Mobile manage the flow of data on its network?\n&nbsp.\n<p>We engineer our network to provide consistent high-speed data service, but at times and at locations where the number of customers using the network exceeds available network resources, customers will experience reduced data speeds.\nTo provide the best possible experience for the most possible customers on their T-Mobile-branded plans,&nbsp;we implement network management practices on a content-agnostic basis, such as caching less data, prioritizing data usage of non-Heavy Data Users, and video optimization.&nbsp;These practices do not discriminate against offerings that might compete against those offered by&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;or any&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;affiliate on the basis of such competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>T-Mobile also addresses the priority needs of emergency communications, law enforcement, public safety, or national security authorities, consistent with or as permitted by applicable law.\nthis may impact other users\u2019 service during times of congestion such as during a natural disaster or other emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For additional information on network practices, see the discussion below in&nbsp;<b>Network management for extremely high data usage and tethering&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>How does&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;address network priority for its plans and brands?</b>\n</p> Video Optimization\n<p>T-Mobile uses streaming video optimization technology.\nStreaming video optimization improves overall data usage management of the network, resulting in greater network speeds and throughput for other customers using data because less network payload is dedicated to video.\nFor customers on limited high-speed plans, optimization also helps customers stretch their high-speed data while streaming video.\nFor video that is not self-optimized by the video provider, we adjust the delivery rate for streaming video, which causes the video to be delivered in lower resolutions and to use less data.Choice of high-speed data<br>\n</p>\n<p>Video optimization occurs only for data streams that are identified by our packet-core network as video or where the video provider has chosen to establish protocols to self-optimize its video.\nSome videos, like those consumed via VPN or while tethering, may be difficult to identify as video and therefore cannot be optimized.\nThe streaming video optimization process applies to content identified as video regardless of the content itself or the website that provides it.\nWhile many changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on a user's device.&nbsp;In some instances, video optimization may also identify and treat downloads of video files as if they were real-time video streams.\nHowever, T-Mobile offers content providers a way to opt-in to a protocol to help identify video downloads to ensure they are not treated as streaming video.</p>\n<p>Video streaming optimization, when connected to the cellular network, delivers a DVD-quality (up to 1.5 Mbps, typically 480p) video experience instead of a higher resolution version (e.g.\nHD or Ultra HD), which is better suited for larger screens.\nVideo optimization is not applied when a device is using Wi-Fi to connect to a non-T-Mobile network.</p>\n<p>Customers on our Magenta plan, where DVD-quality video optimization is always enabled, may choose to activate and enable a feature or plan where video streams at speeds that provide up to UHD video capability (max 4K), in the United States, e.g., with Magenta Max.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Some of our customers are on data plans which include video optimization as a customer-controlled feature called \"Binge On,\" which customers may choose to disable and re-enable at any time.\nSome video providers may choose to opt-out of the Binge On program,&nbsp;see listing.\nThe Binge On optimization technology is not applied to the video services of these providers and high-speed data consumption will continue as if Binge On were not enabled.</p>\nNetwork management for extremely high data usage and tethering\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of our plan options feature a customer-chosen high-speed data allotment with reduced speeds on our network after the high-speed allotment is exhausted, so customers can choose the combination of high-speed data and price that is right for their needs.\nUnlimited high-speed data customers do not have a specific high-speed data allotment on their device, however, and customers on some limited high-speed plans may have extremely high data usage under certain circumstances, including if their plan enables access to significant amounts of data that does not count against their high-speed data allotment.\nWhile T-Mobile continues to expand its network capacity, at this time, some network management for these scenarios is required, because very heavy data usage at times and places of competing network demands can affect the network performance for other customers.</p>\n<p>To provide the best possible experience for the most possible customers on their T-Mobile-branded plans, and to minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we manage significant high-speed data usage on the vast majority of our plans through prioritization.\nHeavy Data Users (as defined by a customer\u2019s rate plan) will have their data usage prioritized below the data usage (including tethering) of other customers at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds.\nAt the start of the next bill cycle, the customer's usage status is reset, and this data traffic is no longer prioritized below other traffic.\nCustomers who use data in violation of their Rate Plan terms or T-Mobile's Terms and Conditions may be excluded from this calculation.\nData features that may not count against the high-speed data allotment for some plans, such as certain data associated with Music Freedom, or Binge On, still count towards all customers' usage for this calculation.\nSmartphone Mobile HotSpot (tethering) data is also included in this calculation.\nData used for customer service applications such as the T-Mobile My Account app does not count towards customers' usage for this calculation.\nTo help avoid application of this practice, and reduce mobile data consumption, customers can set automatic updating of apps, podcasts and file downloads to run off Wi-Fi (making sure to connect to Wi-Fi to update applications and system periodically).</p>\n<p>Similarly, while we permit tethering pursuant to the terms, conditions and allotments of your data plan, significant Smartphone Mobile HotSpot (tethering) usage can affect on-device network performance for all customers.\nTo ensure the best possible on-device experience, and to minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we prioritize on-device data (except that of our mobile internet plans 30GB or higher offered after December 12, 2020, our Project 10Million and some other education-focused mobile internet plans, home broadband, and Heavy Data Users, as described above) over tethering data at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower tethering speeds.</p>\n<p>Where the network is lightly loaded in relation to available capacity, a customer whose data is prioritized higher than other traffic&nbsp;will notice little, if any, effect from having higher priority.\nThis will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations.\nCustomers may notice reduced speeds in comparison to customers with a higher priority during network congestion.\nAt times and at locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, these customers will likely see significant reductions in data speeds, especially if they are engaged in data-intensive activities.\nCustomers should be aware that these practices may occasionally result in speeds below those typically experienced on our 5G or LTE networks, including a greater likelihood of reduced speeds in the lower end of the speed ranges.&nbsp.\nDepending on the extent of network congestion, these customers may notice more frequent impacts to some video streaming, file downloads, and other high-bandwidth activities.&nbsp;T-Mobile constantly works to improve network performance and capacity, but there are physical and technical limits on how much capacity is available, and in constrained locations the frequency of heavy loading in relation to available capacity may be greater than in other locations.\nWhen network loading goes down or the customer moves to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, the customer's speeds will likely improve.</p>\n<p>You can check your data plan usage at any time by signing in to my.t-mobile.com and clicking on the usage tab or by dialing #web# from your T-Mobile phone.\nYour total \"on-network data\" is the number used for purposes of heavy data usage prioritization.</p>\nChoice of high-speed data\n<p>Customers select how much high-speed data they receive under their service plan.\nCertain features, such as Music Freedom, some Binge On content, data used by certain T-Mobile customer service applications, such as the T-Mobile App,&nbsp;and the federal telehealth VA Video Connect app, do&nbsp;not count against your high-speed data allotment.\nIf your total high-speed data usage exceeds your selected high-speed allotment during a billing cycle,&nbsp;we reduce your data speed to 2G speeds (for most plans, 128 kbps) for the remainder of that billing cycle.</p>\n<p>Some high-speed smartphone data plans include a data allotment for Smartphone Mobile HotSpot (tethering).\nafter that allotment is used, tethering is slowed to up to 2G speeds (128 kbps) for the rest of the billing cycle.\nThe Magenta plan includes a set amount of high-speed tethering, and then continues at up to 3G speeds (600kbps).\nThe T-Mobile Essentials plan includes tethering at up to 3G speeds (600 kbps).\nCustomers may choose to activate an add-on feature for a set amount of high-speed tethering.\nDepending on the capability of your device, tethering your device to other lawful devices is permitted up to 10 devices, pursuant to the terms, conditions and allotments of your data plan.\nSome video consumed while tethering may be difficult to identify as video and therefore cannot be optimized.</p>\nT-Mobile Fair Usage commitment to on-device usage\n<p>The&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;Fair Usage commitment is how we ensure that the highest number of customers have the best possible experience for the most common uses on our network.\nSpecifically, to ensure that smartphones and tablets have fair access to the network, we will monitor mobile hotspot/tethering usage on a regular basis to ensure that mobile hotspot usage is both reasonable and fair.&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;mobile service is designed to be used primarily on smartphones and tablets.&nbsp;T-Mobile&nbsp;mobile hotspot (tethering) features are intended for personal mobile connectivity, not intended to be a complete broadband replacement for multiple users over an extended period of time.\nIf you are a Heavy Data User and use a device as a mobile hotspot for the majority of your use over an extended period of time, we may contact you to discuss your plan and your options.</p>\nOther network management\n<p>If you use your data plan in a manner that could interfere with other customers' service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers, or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your data session, or switch you to a more appropriate data plan, or terminate your service.</p>\n<p>Finally, certain uses of our network are also prohibited as described in our Terms and Conditions under the heading \"Examples of Permitted and Prohibited Uses of the Services and Your Device.\" For example, applications which automatically consume unreasonable amounts of available network capacity or are designed for unattended use are prohibited as they may interfere with our ability to provide a good service experience for the majority of our customers, cause capacity issues, and/or degrade network performance.\nSee our Terms and Conditions for a list of prohibited uses.</p>\n<p>\n<b>For additional important Open Internet disclosures, including our Privacy Statement, please review the Frequently Asked Questions.</b>\n</p> Frequently Asked Questions What\u2019s the network experience for customers who select a lower network priority plan or brand? As discussed above, we offer a range of network priorities by rate plan and brand.\nWhere the network is lightly loaded, customers will notice little, if any, effect from selecting a plan with lower network priority.\nThis will be the case in the vast majority of times and locations.\nAt times and at locations where the network is heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, however, those customers will likely see reductions in data speeds, especially if they are engaged in data-intensive activities.\nDepending on the extent of network congestion, these customers may notice more frequent impacts to some video streaming, file downloads, and other high-bandwidth activities.\nT-Mobile constantly works to improve network performance and capacity, but there are physical and technical limits on how much capacity is available, and at constrained locations, the frequency of heavy loading in relation to available capacity may be greater than at other locations.\nWhen network loading goes down or those customers move to a location that is less heavily loaded in relation to available capacity, those customers' speeds will likely improve.\nDoes data traffic from T-Mobile products preloaded on a user's device or otherwise available from T-Mobile have precedence over data traffic from other applications? No.\nThey are treated just like any other data application on the network, and traffic from these applications is subject to the same reasonable network management practices as other data on the network.\nWhat security measures does T-Mobile use to protect its Broadband Internet Access Services? We use a variety of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect our network from events that may negatively impact our customers' ability to use our Broadband Internet Access Services.\nWe monitor our network to protect against security threats, including spam, viruses, automated attacks, worms, distributed denial of service attacks, and other potentially malicious activity.\nWhen we detect a threat, we may attempt to prevent it from spreading across our network using a variety of security measures, which may include, among other things, requiring device software updates and rerouting, prohibiting, or limiting some traffic over our network, typically until the threat is resolved.\n<br>\n<br> Unless part of an opted-in customer service, T-Mobile does not block lawful traffic based on content or subject.\nOccasionally, cases arise where T-Mobile must make a judgment, determining that the value of protecting our customer base from malicious or other adverse, network-impacting traffic outweighs access issues experienced by a few.\nExamples include Internet sources or destinations that are major sources of spam and sources that aggressively scan Internet addresses or those that have attempted attacks against T-Mobile infrastructure or customer end-points.\n<br>\n<br> T-Mobile blocks a limited number of Internet addresses that are disruptive or malicious and typically persistent, based on our review of third party industry-wide intelligence.\nT-Mobile does not block sites based on content or subject, unless the Internet address hosts unlawful content or is blocked as part of an opted-in customer service.\n<br>\n<br> For our Wi-Fi services, which are accessible in a wide range of commercial establishments and public venues, T-Mobile prevents the use of certain ports that are commonly used to spread malware and engage in other malicious activity.\nDoes T-Mobile allow customers to use non- T-Mobile devices and applications for its Broadband Internet Access Services? T-Mobile customers may use any compatible GSM, UMTS, LTE, or 5G device, such as a tablet or smartphone, to access our Broadband Internet Access Services, as long as they do not cause harm to our network.\nT-Mobile may limit activations of compatible devices on older technologies as we transition our network to newer technologies..\n<br>\n<br> If you did not purchase your device from T-Mobile, please be aware that T-Mobile has not made any determination as to the call quality, performance, or other functionality provided by the device.\n<br>\n<br> Our customers may use our Broadband Internet Access Services to access any lawful application, including real-time applications, in a manner consistent with our Terms and Conditions.\nT-Mobile reserves the right to take whatever measures are necessary to protect our network from potentially harmful devices and applications.\nThe performance of a real-time application on our network depends on the speed and latency of the subscriber's connection, as well as their chosen data plan (see above for details).\n<br>\n<br> In most markets the T-Mobile 3G / 4G network operates in the Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) 1700/2100 MHz band and/or the Personal Communications Services (PCS) 1900 MHz band using Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) technology.\nT-Mobile also operates in the 600 MHz and 700 MHz band in some markets.\n5G devices on T-Mobile's network must support either 600 MHz (low-band), 2.5GHz (mid-band) or 28/39 GHz (mmWave).\nIn order to connect to the T-Mobile 3G / 4G network a device must support UMTS and HSPA technology in the AWS 1700/2100 MHz band and PCS (1900) band.\nThe T-Mobile 2G network operates in the Personal Communications Services (PCS) (1900) band.\nTo connect to this network a device must support GSM technology in the PCS 1900 band.\nHow can customers manage their experience on the Broadband Internet Access Services provided by T-Mobile? You may block use of certain Internet sites or the Internet generally on individual lines, e.g., for privacy or child safety reasons.\nAdditional information on blocking Internet sites is available at https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-2144 and https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/t-mobile-family-mode.\nHow does T-Mobile protect the privacy of customers using its mobile Broadband Internet Access Services?
