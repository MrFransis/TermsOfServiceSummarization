may allow you to invite friends, follow others, comment on or make unique posts, or share photos, video or other personal content.\nWhen you affirmatively share this content, we may collect and use it in accordance with this Notice.\nAdditionally, by way of your social engagement, we may receive information about you from another user, such as when your friend posts content that includes you.</p>\n<p>From time to time we engage in research, analysis, historical and scientific studies either alone or with partners.\nAs part of such efforts we invite individuals to participate and voluntarily share information through an informed consent process.\nWhen we receive personal information from a third party for the purpose of such research we undertake processes to validate that the personal information has been collected in a responsible and lawful manner.</p>\n<p>If you submit any personal information about other people to us or to our service providers, you are responsible for making sure that you have the authority to do so and to allow us to use their personal information in accordance with this Privacy Notice (for example, by your asking for their consent).</p> Device and Product Operation <p>If you download and use certain&nbsp;Intel\u00ae&nbsp;Service like software or an app, we may track and collect usage data, such as when the software or app accesses our servers, what information and files have been downloaded through the use of the software or app, and how you interact with the software or app during use.\nSome of this data may be protected as personal information under applicable data protection laws.\nWe collect this information to understand how you interact with&nbsp;Intel\u00ae&nbsp;Services and provide you the best experiences.\nWe may also use this information for security purposes.\nWe may associate the information we collect from more than one device that you use with other information that we have collected about you or your other devices.</p>\n<p>In addition, most computing devices include embedded technology like processing chips that collect information about how the device is operating.\nThis information may include:</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nType and version of operating system, hardware version, device settings, software types, battery and signal strength, screen resolution, device manufacturer and model, language, and Internet browser type and version.\nThe name and version of any&nbsp;Intel\u00ae&nbsp;Services (such as the app) you are using is also collected.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nGeographic locations, such as through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals.</p>\n<p>\u00b7&nbsp.\nConnection information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, browser type, language and time zone, mobile phone number and IP address.</p>\n<p>Access to this information by other applications and transmission of this information from the device to Intel or other service providers may be controlled by the operating system or other software running on the device.</p>\n<p>In some instances Intel technology is used within a product or device that may collect personal information, which is not shared with Intel.\nThis information may be collected by the manufacturer of the product or device and you will need to read the privacy notice, privacy policy, or related terms published by that manufacturer to understand how they use your information.</p>\n<p>Some&nbsp;Intel\u00ae&nbsp;Services may allow you to use biometric information for identification or authentication or to take advantage of specific features.\nBiometric data may include your fingerprint, facial features, voice or similar unique physical characteristics.</p>\n<p>Intel\u00ae&nbsp;Services can also collect geographic location information, such as location inferred from your IP address or GPS, and information about how you engage with and use Intel\u00ae&nbsp;Services, for example where you have chosen to activate location-enabled services on the device with which you access these services.</p>\n<p>When&nbsp;Intel\u00ae&nbsp;Services use more sensitive categories of your personal information, such as biometrics for identification or authentication, or precise geographic location, Intel will honor the preferences you set in accompanying menus and settings.</p>\n<p>We collect information from and about a wide variety of technologies where&nbsp;Intel\u00ae&nbsp;Services are used.\nThe kind of information collected depends on the technology, the use, and the device and personal settings.\nExamples of these technologies might include computers, phones and tablets, but also interactive wearables, connected technologies in the home, drones or other vehicles.\nWhere we provide technology for drones and autonomous vehicles, these may capture audio, video and photographs that unintentionally or incidentally capture people, for example workers in a field or pedestrians crossing a street.\nWhere appropriate, we use technical and organizational controls to prevent it from being used improperly, but this information is important to help improve algorithms for product functionality and safety, including features such as mapping topography, obstacles, traffic and the like.</p> Information from Third Parties <p>We obtain information through partners, vendors, suppliers and other third parties.\nThe parties from whom we obtain information are typically corporate enterprises (although some may also be educational or public enterprises) and they may be located in any of the locations

otherwise legally permitted to disclose your personal information to us.\nWe might also obtain information through a partner, or co-create datasets with a partner, as part of our business operations.\nThis kind of data is used for work like improving algorithms and data models, product testing and improvement, enhancing existing products and developing new capabilities and
