we collect \u201c<strong>Personal information</strong>\u201d on you, which is data that can be used to identify you as an individual, or to contact you.\nThe type of Personal Information we collect about you depends on the situation.\nPlease read below for more detail on the type of data we collect.\nIf you do not agree with this policy, please do not provide us with any Personal Information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect your name, contact details and your preferred means of communication.\nWe may also collect your responses to survey and assessment questions.</li>\n<li>In

professional credentials, memberships in professional organizations, skills, etc.), citizenship, trade union membership, information from former employers and other references, and additional information to the extent we have acquired or you have provided us with such information.\nWe also use photos of you that you provide to us or that you make publicly available on the Internet (e.g.,

user names, passwords, and password hints.</li>\n<li>Where permitted by law, we may collect compensation and benefits information about you to consult with you or our clients on rewards and benefits.</li>\n<li>In certain cases, we may request sensitive Personal Information about you.\nWe may use this information to ensure that our Services conform with legal requirements, including equal opportunity laws.\nOur assessments and surveys may include demographic survey questions like questions about gender, race, age, or country of origin.\nExcept in these limited cases, we encourage you not to provide any other sensitive Personal Information to us, such as government identification numbers, payment card numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,

technologies</li>\n<li>App usage data</li>\n<li>Demographic information and other information provided by you</li>\n<li>Aggregated information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because Other Information does not reveal

disclose it for the purposes for which we use and disclose your Personal Information as detailed in this Policy.</p>\n<p>We (or 3<sup>rd</sup> parties who provide services to us) may collect Other Information in a variety of ways.\nFor instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use \u201ccookies\u201d (small text files placed on a visitor\u2019s computer hard drive) and other similar technologies to help us determine information like the type of content a visitor to the Site consumes, and the length of time each visitor spends at any area of the Site.\nCookies and similar technologies enhance your

diminished and some features may not work as intended.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nHow we collect your data\n<p>There are two primary ways we may collect personal information on you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directly from you, whenever you interact with Bartell &amp.\nBartell and our websites and offerings</li>\n<li>From our clients to whom we are providing Services or other third parties who assist us in providing you and our clients with services.</li>\n</ul>\nFrom you directly\n<p>Often, we will collect data from you directly as part of our Services.\nFor instance, we may collect Personal Information when you register to use our Online Systems, complete online assessments or surveys, participate in online or in-person courses, provide Personal Information about yourself to our team of consultants, or contact us via e-mail, electronic forms, telephone or postal mail.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please note: If you submit any Personal Information about other people to us or to our service providers, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Policy.</li>\n</ul>\nFrom Clients and other third parties\n<p>As part of our services, clients (often your employer or a potential employer) will share Personal Information about you, such as resumes, employment history, or other information required for us to perform our Services with the client.\nAdditionally, when someone participates in an assessment or coaching experience, they may share Personal Information about you.</p>\n<p>When providing our Services, we may also obtain Personal Information about you from your potential employer, referrals, networking activities, public databases, joint marketing partners, licensed databases, and social media platforms.\nThe information we collect from these third parties includes information about the identity of potential candidates (e.g., an individual\u2019s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address), information about their background and qualifications (employment history, education, professional credentials, memberships in professional organizations, skills, etc.), citizenship, information from former employers and other references.\nWe also use photos of you that you provide to us or that you make publicly available on the Internet (e.g., LinkedIn).\nAs permitted by applicable laws, we may also obtain background verification information.</p>\nHow we use your data\n<p>Bartell &amp.\nBartell uses the Personal Information we collect in several ways.\nPrimarily, we use your data in four primary ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To serve you and our clients</li>\n<li>For our internal business (operational) purposes</li>\n<li>For research</li>\n<li>For Marketing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The summary below provides additional details about the ways we use the Personal Information we collect.</p>\nTo serve you and our clients\n<p>The primary way we use your Personal Information to provide our Services to you and our clients.\nIn particular, we do this to fulfill our contractual relationships with you and our clients and where we have a legitimate, beneficial interest in using Personal Information to conduct our business.</p>\n<p>A primary aspect of our Services is the administration and interpretation of assessments and diagnostics.\nAs part of offering these services, we use your Personal Information to help consult with our clients to help them have more efficient organizations and achieve greater performance.\nDuring the course of these consultations, your Personal Information may be used as part of our processes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we use your Personal Information to respond to your inquiries, to verify your information, or to share information with you.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will use your Personal Information to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests.\nIf you contact us, we keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and we use information you provide in your message to respond to your inquiry.\nWe do so to manage our contractual relationship with you.</li>\n<li>From time to time we use your Personal Information to send you important information regarding the Online Systems, changes to our terms, conditions, policies, and other administrative information.</li>\n<li>We may also contact you to verify that the Personal Information we collected about you is accurate and current.\nWe use the Personal Information to manage our contractual relationship with you or to comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n</ul>\nFor internal business purposes\n<p>We also use your Personal Information to help operate our business.</p>\n<p>For instance, we use your Personal Information for our business needs, such as audits, internal communication regarding candidates and clients, determining the effectiveness of our promotional activities, administering our Services, maintaining and securing our infrastructure, and for procurement and financial transactions.\nOften we use this Personal Information to manage our contractual relationship with you and our clients, to comply with a legal obligation, and because we have a legitimate beneficial business interest.</p>\nFor Research\n<p>We may use Personal Information to conduct analysis in order to further the state of organizational science.\nThis often includes the development of thought leadership materials and research studies.\nAny published product will refer only to larger aggregations of individuals and will not identify you personally or include any results attributable to you.\nWe perform analysis because we have a legitimate beneficial business interest in doing so.</p>\n<p>In particular, we may retain and use Personal Information about you for research, publication, development, benchmarking and norms, validation, longitudinal studies, trend analysis, to improve and enhance our Services or to develop and market new Services.\nWe may use Personal Information about you to ensure that our Services conform with legal requirements like equal opportunity laws.\nWe also may use your name and other personal identifiers to associate and combine information about you that is collected from one Service with information about you collected through other Services.</p>\n<p>During the course of research and analysis endeavors we often pseudonymize or key-code your Personal Information, meaning that personal identifiers are stripped from all information that may directly identify you, and are replaced with a code to minimize unwanted or unintended identification.\nSuch key-coded information can be de-coded by using the key so that it identifies you again.</p>\n<p>We may also anonymize, aggregate or de-identify Personal Information so the end-product does not identify you or any other individual.\nFor example, we may use this information to generate norms by industry, geography, level, etc., enable us to understand where our Services are being utilized, conduct ongoing validation studies, compile reports, and publish journal articles to further the knowledge base of organizational and leadership science.\nSuch aggregated, anonymized or de-identified information is not considered Personal Information for purposes of this Policy and we may use it for any purpose.</p>\nFor Marketing\n<p>We may use your Personal Information to send you information or marketing materials.\nPlease note that if we obtained your Personal Information because of an engagement with our client, or you are using our Products at the request of your employer, you will not receive marketing materials as a result of the Personal Information we obtained from those Services.</p>\n<p>Regularly, Bartell sends informational e-mails, articles, white papers, proposals, engagement letters, and information regarding our Services.\nWe also may use your Personal Information to conduct surveys.\nWe do so either with your consent or because we have a legitimate beneficial business interest.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, we may desire to use your Personal Information in press releases and direct marketing materials.\nBefore we use your Personal Information in that way, we will obtain consent from you.</p>\nWho has access to your data\n<p>How your Personal Information is disclosed to other parties and who has access to our data will depend upon the situation.\nHowever, as we take your privacy seriously, Bartell &amp.\nBartell provides access to your Personal Information to a limited group of parties, each for a legitimate business interest.\nPrimarily, there are four groups who may have access to your data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our clients</li>\n<li>Partner Organizations</li>\n<li>Our Service Providers</li>\n<li>Other required parties (for legal or safety needs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The summary below provides additional details about who has access to your data.</p>\nOur Clients\n<p>Primarily, we use your Personal Information in the course of providing our Services.\nWhile providing our Services, we may disclose your Personal Information to clients who have engaged our services.\nOur clients are often your employer or an organization with whom you are seeking employment.</p>\n<p>As part of our Services we may disclose Personal Information regarding candidates and employees, including the results of assessments and related data, to employers that have engaged Bartell to fulfill selection or development requests.</p>\n<p>In the course of conducting our Services and in providing our Products to clients, we may disclose Personal Information to our client for the purpose of helping them improve their business.\nFor example, we may discuss your assessment results during the course of interpreting a diagnostic for the purpose of helping your organization improve your working conditions.</p>\n<p>If you have completed an assessment or survey at our client\u2019s request as part of our Services or related to a Product, we will not share your assessment results with other clients (outside the client who contracted with us) without obtaining the appropriate consent.</p>\nPartner Organizations\n<p>Bartell maintains a network of partner organizations and independent consultants.\nThese partner organizations and consultants often work directly with Bartell, or with our clients, to provide additional Services in support of the client\u2019s business.\nTo the extent permitted by law, we may share Personal Information with partners to provide seamless Services for you and our clients.\nBartell is responsible for managing jointly-used Personal Information.</p>\n<p>To obtain a list of our partners and independent consultants who have access to your personal information, please contact us at: info@bartellbartell.com.</p>\nService Providers\n<p>Bartell may share personal information with third parties who provide services in the support of our business operations.\nFor example, these third parties may perform services such as assessment processing, delivering products to you, providing customer service, conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys, data analysis, marketing services, attorneys, accountants, and other administrative and back-up and security services.</p>\nOther Instances\n<p>Bartell may also use or disclose Personal Information (to comply with a legal obligation or because we have legitimate interest to do so) in order to: (i) comply with applicable laws, (ii) respond to inquiries, requests or orders from public or government authorities, including those outside of your country of residence, or (iii) protect the rights, privacy, safety or property, of Bartell, you or others.</p>\n<p>We cannot and do not assume any responsibility for the actions or omissions of third parties, such as clients, including the way they use Personal Information received either from Bartell or from other independent sources.</p>\nData Protection and Security\n<p>At Bartell, we always desire your data to remain secure.\nFor this reason, Bartell has reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of Personal Information about users of the Online Systems or our Services which is under our control.\nUnfortunately, however, no security system, or system of transmitting information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>\n<p>If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised or your user credentials are no longer secure), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as described in the \u201cQuestions and Additional Information\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at times, we may maintain a physical copy of your Personal Information.\nBartell has reasonable administrative and security measures in place to protect against the unwanted access to, or loss of, your information.\nAside from designated Bartell employees, we do not allow parties outside of Bartell to access your personal information, unless it is required by law or as part of providing our Services.</p>\nChoice\n<p>Your provision of Personal Information to us is voluntary.\nHowever, please be aware that if you do not provide certain Personal Information you may not be able to participate in our Services or access our online systems.\nThis could include being removed from consideration for a job or promotion by one of our clients or your employer.</p>\nData Access\n<p>You have the ability to access a copy of your data at any time by contacting us directly.</p>\n<p>Please contact us info@bartellbartell.com if you would like to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask questions about how we handle your Personal

our Online Systems.</p>\nData Removal\n<p>At any time, you can request that your Personal Information be removed from Bartell\u2019s databases.</p>\n<p>To remove your Personal Information from Bartell databases, please contact us at info@bartellbartell.com.</p>\n<p>To your best ability, when contacting us, please include all relevant User IDs and e-mail addresses as well as the names of any Bartell (or Bartell related) sites, products, or services you may have accessed as part of participating in our Services or accessing our Online Systems for which you would like to have your data removed.</p>\n<p>Bartell will make reasonable attempts to delete Personal Information upon your request.\nHowever, to maintain consistency in our Services and operations, we retain backup systems to secure your data.\nWhen you ask that your information be removed from Bartell databases, we may not be able to delete residual copies from our systems or from our backup systems, but they will continue to be protected as required under this Policy.</p>\n<p>Please note that as part of our Services, your Personal Data may be shared with our clients or third parties.\nFor example, we may send our clients assessment instrument results as PDF documents to support our business purposes.\nIn these cases, we have no control over the access, removal, or modification of your data.\nIf you would like your data to be removed from the possession of a third party, please contact that party directly.\nIf you would like a list of clients or other parties your data has been provided to, please contact us at info@bartellbartell.com.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when we perform Services at the specific request of our client, your request for data removal or access may need to be directed to that client.\nWe may only be able to provide you with a non-confidential summary of our final assessment report because these reports contain confidential client or other Personal Information that we are not allowed to disclose.</p>\nOpt-out and removal of Marketing Data\n<p>If you would like to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us, please contact us at info@bartellbartell.com to have your contact information removed from our marketing databases.</p>\n<p>If you request to have your information removed from our marketing databases through an email request, please include

marketing communications from which you want to opt-out.</p>\n<p>We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.\nWe may decline to process requests that in our reasonable opinion may jeopardize the privacy of others or put our intellectual property at risk.</p>\n<p>For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.\nWe will comply with your request as soon as reasonably practical and may need to contact you to be sure that we understand your request.</p>\n<p>We also may need to retain certain Personal Information about you such as your e-mail address to honor opt-out or similar requests.\nPlease keep in mind that this residual Personal Information will remain within Bartell databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain identifiable Personal Information about you.\nThe residual Personal Information will not be used for commercial purposes.\nHowever, Bartell reserves the right, from time to time, to recontact former users of its Services as appropriate for important updates or notifications.</p>\nData Retention Period\n<p>We retain your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted considering the purpose(s) for which it was obtained, and to provide our services to our clients.</p>\n<p>The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you or our client (e.g., for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services)</li>\n<li>A period beyond the time of the ongoing relationship if we have a legitimate internal operations need, such as a need to retain such information for analysis, record-keeping and compliance with data retention schedules</li>\n<li>Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period before we can delete them)</li>\n<li>Whether retention is advisable considering our legal position (such as regarding applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, anonymized data may be aggregated and stored indefinitely for our own research purposes.</p>\nLimitation\n<p>This Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties.</p>\n<p>For instance, in use of our Online Systems, you may have the opportunity to follow a link from or to other websites maintained by Bartell affiliates, or other third parties.\nThe inclusion of a link on our Online Systems does
