from other members of our corporate family.\nTherefore, we may share your information with other companies within Vodafone Group (for example, your local carrier).\nThe laws of the countries where

service providers in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).\nThe EEA consists of countries in the European Union, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway: they are considered to

sure that your information is properly protected.\nWe will always ensure that there is a proper legal agreement that covers the data transfer.\nIn addition, if the country is not considered to have laws that are equivalent to EU data protection standards then we will ask the third party to enter into a legal agreement that reflects those standards.</p>\n<p>How long we keep your personal

unauthorised access, accidental loss, disclosure or destruction.</p>\n<p>Communications over the internet (such as emails) aren\u2019t secure unless they\u2019ve been encrypted.\nYour communications may go through a number of countries before being delivered, as this is the nature of the internet.</p>\n<p>We cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll never ask for your secure personal or account information by an unsolicited means of communication.\nYou\u2019re responsible for keeping your personal
