compensation on the part of the Company for loss of life, bodily injuries, damage to health, the violation of essential contractual obligations (cardinal obligations) or damages resulting from a deliberate or grossly negligent breach of duty on the part of Flattr, its legal representatives or agents.\nCardinal obligations within the meaning of these Terms are the obligations that ensure the

obligations, we are only liable for contract-typical, foreseeable damage caused by simple negligence, except claims made by Users for compensation resulting from loss of life, bodily injury or damage to health.<br>\n(iii) The regulations outlined in this Section 11 (2) and (3) also apply to legal representatives and agents of Flattr if the claims are made directly against

offices.<br>\nThe Swedish courts will have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with the terms or their subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).<br>\nIn any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover the costs of the proceedings including, but not limited to, any reasonable legal fees and costs.</p>\n12.2.\nGoverning language\n<p>These Terms are drawn up in the English language and may be translated into any language other than English provided that the English text will in any event prevail.</p>\n12.3 Severability\n<p>Should any individual provision of these Terms be or become invalid and / or contrary to the statutory provisions, this will not affect the validity remaining terms of these Terms.\nIn place of the invalid, unenforceable term, the parties shall mutually agree on such valid commercial terms which the parties would reasonably have agreed otherwise.\nThe above mentioned provision will apply correspondingly in the case of omissions in these provisions.</p>\n<p>October 12th, 2017</p>\n", "created_at": "2018-07-17
