more effective and provide participants with additional information about conservation issues.\n&nbsp;If you submit personally identifiable information to the Sierra Club some information, such as your name and mailing address, may be exchanged with other organizations.\nMembers may opt out of such membership list exchanges by following the Opt-Out Procedures, below</p>\n<p>Collection and Use

Sites.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Google Analytics</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We also use Google services, including Google Analytics and Google AdWords which uses cookies and other, similar technologies to collect information about Site use anonymously and reports website trends, without identifying individual visitors.\nYou can learn about Google\u2019s practices by going to

delete that child\u2019s information from the Sites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use the information we learn from you to help us personalize and continually
