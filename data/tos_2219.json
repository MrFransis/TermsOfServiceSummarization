on Runalyze.com is used to operate and administer the site.\nThe processed data is used to improve and correct the functionality of the service.</p> Access data/server log files <p>The provider (or its hosting provider) collects data about every access to the offer (so-called server log files).\nAccess data includes:</p>\n<p>Name of the accessed website, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.</p>\n<p>The provider uses the protocol data only for statistical evaluations for the purpose of operation, security and optimisation of the offer.\nHowever, the provider reserves the right to check the log data subsequently if there is a justified suspicion of illegal use based on concrete indications.</p> Contacting <p>When contacting the provider (e.\ng.\nby means of a contact form or e-mail) the user's details are stored for the purpose of processing the enquiry and in the event that follow-up questions arise.</p> Comments and posts <p>If users leave comments in the blog or other posts, their IP addresses are stored.\nThis is done for the security of the provider, if someone writes illegal contents in comments and contributions (sworn, forbidden political propaganda, etc.).\nIn this case the provider can be prosecuted for the comment or contribution and is therefore interested in the identity of the author.</p> Integration of third-party services and content <p>It is possible that third-party content such as videos from YouTube, maps from Google Maps, RSS feeds or graphics from other websites may be included in this online offer.\nThis always presupposes that the providers of this content (hereinafter referred to as \"third-party providers\") perceive the IP address of the users.\nWithout the IP address, they would not be able to send the content to the browser of the respective user.\nThe IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content.\nWe make every effort to use only those contents whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the contents.\nHowever, we have no influence if the third-party providers store the IP address for statistical purposes, for example.\nAs far as we know, we inform the users about this.</p> Matomo <p>This offer uses Matomo (formerly Piwik), an open source software for statistical analysis of user access.\nMatomo uses \"cookies\", which are text files placed on the user's computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site.\nThe information generated by the cookie about the use of this offer is stored on the server of the provider in Germany.\nThe IP address is made anonymous immediately after processing and before it is stored.\nUsers may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on their browser, however, the provider points out to users that in this case they may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.</p> Google Maps <p>This offer uses Google Maps, which is operated by Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (\"Google\").\nWhen a user visits a website that displays a map of Google Maps, the browser establishes a direct connection to Google's servers.\nAccording to Google, no personal data is collected without a click on the button.\nOnly with logged in members, such data, among other things the IP address, are raised and processed.</p>\n<p>The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Google as well as your relevant rights and setting options for the protection of your privacy can be seen by the users of Google Terms of Use for Google Maps.</p> OpenStreetMap <p>This site uses OpenStreetMap (OSM) to display geodata.\nOpenstreetmap does not store user data.\nFurther

site uses KeyCDN (a CDN provider) to deliver the content to the user faster.\nClient IP addresses are anonymized.\nFurther information can be found in the Terms of use, Privacy policy and GDPR section.</p> Gravatar <p>We use the profile picture service Gravatar.\nGravatar uses as image URL the mail address as MD5 hashed.\nTo better protect the mail address, the hashed mail address is only forwarded internally to Gravatar via our CDN provider.\nNo client IP is forwarded to Gravatar.\nFurther information about Gravatar can be found in the Privacy policy of Gravatar (Automattic)..</p> OpenWeatherMap <p>This offer uses the interface of OpenWeatherMap to retrieve weather data.\nA single coordinate and the time of the activity is transmitted to OpenWeatherMap.\nNo further information

provided by Twitter Inc, 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.\nThey are recognizable by terms such as \"Twitter\" or \"sequence\", combined with a stylized blue bird.\nWith the help of the buttons it is possible to share a post or page of this offer on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter.</p>\n<p>When a user accesses a website on this website that contains such a button, his browser establishes a direct connection to Twitter's servers.\nThe content of the Twitter button is transmitted directly from Twitter to the user's browser.\nThe provider therefore has no influence on the amount of data Twitter collects with the help of this plugin and informs users according to their level of knowledge.\nAfter this only the IP address of the user the URL of the respective web page is transmitted with the purchase of the Buttons, but not for other purposes, than the representation of the Buttons, used.</p>\n<p>Further information can be found in the Twitter data protection declaration at http://twitter.com/privacy.</p> Google AdSense <p>This offer uses Google AdSense, a service for integrating ads from Google Inc.\n\"(\"Google\").\nGoogle AdSense uses

beacons can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website.</p>\n<p>The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the use of this website (including the IP address of the users) and delivery of advertising formats is transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.\nThis information may be passed on by Google to Google's contractual partners.\nHowever, Google will not merge your IP address with other data stored by you.</p>\n<p>Users may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on their browser, however, the provider points out to users that in this case they may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.\nBy using this website, users consent to the processing of data about them by Google in the manner and for the purposes described above.</p> Amazon Affiliate Program <p>Runalyze is a Amazon Europe S.\u00e0.r.l.\naffiliate and partner of the advertising program, which is
