instituted in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of California in each case located in San Francisco County, California and each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding.</p>8.\nAssignment.#<p>Customer may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in each

and their respective permitted successors and assigns.</p>9.\nExport Regulation.#<p>The Services utilize software and technology that may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export

with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Services or the underlying software or technology available outside the US.</p>10.\nUS Government Rights.#<p>Each of the Documentation and the software components that constitute the Services is a \"commercial item\" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 2.101, consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 12.212.\nAccordingly, if Customer is an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, Customer only receives those rights with respect to the Services and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 12.212, with respect to all other US Government users and their contractors.</p>11.\nEquitable Relief.#<p>Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 6 or, in the case of Customer, Section 2.3, would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy.\nSuch remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise.</p>12.\nPublicity.#<p>Supabase may identify Customer as a user of the Services and may use Customer's name, logo, and other trademarks in Supabase's customer list, press releases, blog posts, advertisements, and website (and all use
