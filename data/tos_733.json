that unlawfully operated \"tube\" websites have on the business and the bottom line of individual studios.\nWhile not every site is alike, Xvideos has been proactive in fighting content theft and copyright infringement - more so than other tube sites - and has taken several steps to ensure not merely legal compliance, but to show loyalty and give proactive assistance to the online adult entertainment community.\nRather than serving as a direct competitor, Xvideos operates as, and continuously aspires to be, a content delivery and marketing component for the broader adult industry.\nXvideos seeks to be a responsible and cooperative member of this industry - not a detriment to it.</p>\n<p>In order to fulfill that goal, Xvideos has evaluated all dimensions of its legal policies and acted to ensure compliance - and protection of content producers - in all aspects.\nFor example, Xvideos was the first to implement fingerprinting technology to inhibit the uploading of infringing content owned by others.\nThis fingerprinting solution is still operating today.</p>\n<p>Although we are based outside North America and not governed by U.S.\nor Canadian law, we respect the rights of copyright owners and thus have implemented certain policies in an effort to voluntarily comply with anti-infringement laws.\nWe reserve all rights and objections to the extraterritorial application of U.S., Canadian, or any other foreign law to our operations in any capacity.\nNonetheless, we believe that protection of copyright owners' content can be best achieved by voluntary compliance with anti-infringement laws.\nCompliance with such laws is of utmost importance to Xvideos.\nAs such, Xvideos has a registered DMCA agent with the U.S.\nCopyright Office, and is otherwise compliant with various anti-infringement laws, including by expeditiously processing all proper notices of alleged infringement.\nIf you would like to submit a notification of infringement about a particular video, click here.</p>\n<p>In addition, Xvideos allows its users to submit counter-notifications when their uploaded material has been mistakenly removed pursuant to a takedown notice.\nXvideos also sends counter-notifications to the complaining copyright holders or their licensees when takedown notices are sent with respect to licensed content, as opposed to content uploaded by the Xvideos' users.</p>\n<p>Please note that Xvideos specifically reserves the right to pursue damages, costs and legal fees available by law in the event a copyright owner or a user submits a copyright infringement notice or counter-notice without a good faith belief regarding the infringing or non-infringing nature of particular content, or to the extent an individual submitting a notice or counter-notice makes any material misrepresentations to Xvideos.</p>\n<p>Finally, Xvideos has implemented a robust and comprehensive repeat infringer policy.\nIn an effort to voluntarily comply with copyright laws, Xvideos has adopted a repeat infringer policy and notified its users of the policy's terms.\nA link to the repeat infringer policy is placed on the upload page of Xvideos.</p>\n<p>This repeat infringer policy bans users from Xvideos if they continue to upload videos that are removed pursuant to takedown notices.\nWhen a user is banned, he or she may not continue to upload content or re-register.</p>\n<p>TAKE-DOWN REQUEST FORM (COPYRIGHT)<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nEMAIL CONTACT FOR OTHER REQUESTS</p> ", "created_at": "2019-05-13 06:48:22.145365", "updated_at":
