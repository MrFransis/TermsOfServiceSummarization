YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Notice for Termination or Suspension</b>\n</p>\n<p>We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates.\n(b) would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service.\nor (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party,

governed by additional terms which provide a license, YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service.\nThis license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner permitted by this Agreement.\nYou are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have YouTube\u2019s written permission.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Open Source<br>\n</b>Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source license that we make available to you.\nThere may be

Community Guidelines are designed to ensure our community stays protected.\nThey set out what\u2019s allowed and not allowed on YouTube, and apply to all types of content on our platform, including videos, comments, links, and thumbnails.</p>\n<p>You'll find a full list of our Community Guidelines below:</p>\n<p>\n</p> Spam &amp.\ndeceptive practices <ul>\n<li> Fake Engagement </li>\n<li>

existing ones?\n<p>Each of our policies is carefully thought through so they are consistent, well-informed, and can be applied to content from around the world.\nThey\u2019re developed in partnership with a wide range of external industry and policy experts, as well as YouTube Creators.\nNew policies go through multiple rounds of testing before they go live to ensure our global team of content reviewers can apply them accurately and consistently.</p>\n<p>This work is never finished, and we are always evaluating our policies to understand how we can better strike a balance between keeping the YouTube community protected and giving everyone a voice.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> How does YouTube identify content that violates Community Guidelines?\n<p>With hundreds of hours of new content uploaded to YouTube every minute, we use a combination of people and machine learning to detect problematic content at scale.\nMachine learning is well-suited to detect patterns, which helps us to find content similar to other content we\u2019ve already removed, even before it\u2019s viewed.</p>\n<p>We also recognize that the best way to quickly remove content is to anticipate problems before they emerge.\nOur Intelligence Desk monitors the news, social media, and user reports to detect new trends surrounding inappropriate content, and works to make sure our teams are prepared to address them before they can become a larger issue.</p> Is there a way for the broader community to flag harmful content?\n<p>Though we are determined to continue reducing exposure to videos that violate our policies and have tasked over 10,000 people with detecting, reviewing, and removing content that violates our guidelines, the YouTube community also plays an important role in flagging content they think is inappropriate.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you see content that you think violates Community Guidelines, you can use our flagging feature to submit content for review.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We developed the YouTube Trusted Flagger program to provide robust content reporting processes to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with expertise in a policy area, government agencies, and individuals with high flagging accuracy rates.\nParticipants receive training on YouTube policies and have a direct path of communication with our Trust &amp.\nSafety specialists.\nVideos flagged by Trusted Flaggers are not automatically removed.\nThey are subject to the same human review as videos flagged by any other user, but we may expedite review by our teams.\nNGOs also receive occasional online training on YouTube policies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> What action does YouTube take for content that violates Community Guidelines?\n<p>Machine learning systems help us identify and remove spam automatically, as well as remove re-uploads of content we\u2019ve already reviewed and determined violates our policies.\nYouTube takes action on other flagged videos after review by trained human reviewers.\nThey assess whether the content does indeed violate our policies, and protect content that has an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic purpose.\nOur reviewer teams remove content that violates our policies and age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences.</p>\nCommunity Guidelines Strikes\n<p>If our reviewers decide that content violates our Community Guidelines, we remove the content and send a notice to the Creator.\nThe first time a Creator violates our Community Guidelines, they receive a warning with no penalty to the channel.\nAfter one warning, we\u2019ll issue a Community Guidelines strike to the channel and the account will have temporary restrictions including not being allowed to upload videos, live streams, or stories for a 1-week period.\nChannels that receive three strikes within a 90-day period will be terminated.\nChannels that are dedicated to violating our policies or that have a single case of severe abuse of the platform, will bypass our strikes system and be terminated.\nAll strikes and terminations can be appealed if the Creator believes there was an error, and our teams will re-review the decision.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Resources <ul>\n<li> Learn more about Community Guidelines strikes </li>\n<li> Appeal a Community Guidelines strike </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\nAge-Restricting Content\n<p>Sometimes content doesn't violate our Community Guidelines, but may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 years of age.\nIn these cases, our review team will place an age restriction on the video so it will not be visible to viewers under 18 years of age, logged-out users, or to those who have Restricted Mode enabled.\nCreators can also choose to age restrict their own content at upload if they think it\u2019s not suitable for younger audiences.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Resources <ul>\n<li> Learn more about age-restricted content </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Related articles <ul>\n<li>

privacy practices<p>We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways.\nOur services include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home</li>\n<li>Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system</li>\n<li>Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy.\nFor example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results.\nAnd you can use many Google services when you\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos.\nYou can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode.\nAnd across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.</p>\n<p>To help explain things as clearly as possible, we\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms.\nAnd if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.</p>Information Google collects<p>We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</p>\n<p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users \u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.\nThe information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\u2019re using.\nThis helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.</p>Things you create or provide to us<p>When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password.\nYou can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account.\nEven if you aren\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \u2014 like an email address to receive updates about our services.</p>\n<p>We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.\nThis includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.</p>Information we collect as you use our servicesYour apps, browsers &amp.\ndevices<p>We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.</p>\n<p>The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number.\nWe also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.</p>\n<p>We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates.\nIf you\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services.\nThis information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.</p>Your activity<p>We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like.\nThe activity information we collect may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terms you search for</li>\n<li>Videos you watch</li>\n<li>Views and interactions with content and ads</li>\n<li>Voice and audio information when you use audio features</li>\n<li>Purchase activity</li>\n<li>People with whom you communicate or share content</li>\n<li>Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services</li>\n<li>Chrome browsing history you\u2019ve synced with your Google Account</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls.</p>\n<p>You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\u2019s saved in your account.</p>\n<p>Go to Google Account</p>Your location information<p>We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you.</p>\n<p>Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GPS</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>Sensor data from your device</li>\n<li>Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings.\nFor example, you can turn your Android device\u2019s location on or off using the device\u2019s settings app.\nYou can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources.\nFor example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name.\nWe may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\nWe also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.</p>\n<p>We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.</p>Why Google collects data<p>We use data to build better services</p>\n<p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>Provide our services<p>We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p>Maintain &amp.\nimprove our services<p>We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us.\nAnd we use your information to make improvements to our services \u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p>Develop new services<p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones.\nFor example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p>Provide personalized services, including content and ads<p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.\nFor example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products.\nAnd Google Play uses information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p>\n<p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests.\nFor example, if you search for \u201cmountain bikes,\u201d you may see an ad for sports equipment when you\u2019re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google.\nYou can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to.\nFor example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \u201ctap to call\u201d button, we\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go to Ad Settings</p>Measure performance<p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used.\nFor example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design.\nAnd we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns.\nWe use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.\nWhen you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>Communicate with you<p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly.\nFor example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location.\nOr we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services.\nAnd if you contact Google, we\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p>Protect Google, our users, and the public<p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services.\nThis includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>\n<p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes.\nWe use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services.\nAnd we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content.\nWe also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data.\nFor example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.</p>\n<p>We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above.\nFor example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.\nDepending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>\n<p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo.\nThis helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>Your privacy controls<p>You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used</p>\n<p>This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.\nYou can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings.\nIn addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.</p>\n<p>Go to Privacy Checkup</p>Managing, reviewing, and updating your information<p>When you\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use.\nFor example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you\u2019ve saved with Google.</p>\n<p>We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account.\nYour Google Account includes:</p>Privacy controlsActivity Controls<p>Decide what types of activity

video suggestions.</p>\n<p>Go to Activity Controls</p>Ad settings<p>Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\nYou can

recommendations, that appear in ads.</p>\n<p>Go to Shared Endorsements</p>Ways to review &amp.\nupdate your informationMy Activity<p>My Activity allows you to review and control data that\u2019s created when you use Google services, like searches you\u2019ve done or your visits to Google Play.\nYou can browse by date and by topic, and delete part or all of your activity.</p>\n<p>Go to My Activity</p>Google Dashboard<p>Google Dashboard allows you to manage information associated with specific products.</p>\n<p>Go to Dashboard</p>Your personal information<p>Manage your contact information, such as your name, email, and phone number.</p>\n<p>Go to Personal Info</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re signed out, you can manage information associated with your browser or device, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Signed-out search personalization: Choose whether your search activity is used to offer you more relevant results and recommendations.</li>\n<li>YouTube settings: Pause and delete your YouTube Search History and your YouTube Watch History.</li>\n<li>Ad Settings: Manage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.</li>\n</ul>Exporting, removing &amp.\ndeleting your information<p>You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.</p>\n<p>Export your data</p>\n<p>You can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law.</p>\n<p>To delete your information, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delete your content from specific Google services</li>\n<li>Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity</li>\n<li>Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products</li>\n<li>Delete your entire Google Account</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Delete your information</p>\n<p>And finally, Inactive Account Manager allows you

or not you\u2019re signed in to a Google Account, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser.\nYou can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains.\nBut remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.</li>\n<li>Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect.\nFor example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.</li>\n</ul>Sharing your informationWhen you share your information<p>Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share.\nFor example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private.\nRemember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity.\nWe may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.</p>When Google shares your information<p>We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:</p>With your consent<p>We\u2019ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent.\nFor example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we\u2019ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant.\nWe\u2019ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.</p>With domain administrators<p>If you\u2019re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account.\nThey may be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email</li>\n<li>View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install</li>\n<li>Change your account password</li>\n<li>Suspend or terminate your account access</li>\n<li>Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request</li>\n<li>Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings</li>\n</ul>For external processing<p>We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.\nFor example, we use service providers to help us with customer support.</p>For legal reasons<p>We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.\nWe share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.</li>\n<li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>\n<li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>\n<li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners \u2014 like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders.\nFor example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.\nWe also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.</p>\n<p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we\u2019ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>Keeping your information secure<p>We build security into our services to protect your information</p>\n<p>All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information.\nThe insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.\nAnd if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we\u2019ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.</p>\n<p>We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit</li>\n<li>We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account</li>\n<li>We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems</li>\n<li>We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it.\nAnyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>\n</ul>Exporting &amp.\ndeleting your information<p>You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time</p>\n<p>You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.</p>\n<p>Export your data</p>\n<p>To delete your information, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delete your content from specific Google services</li>\n<li>Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity</li>\n<li>Delete specific Google products,

collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some data you can delete whenever you like, such as the content you create or upload.\nYou can also delete activity information saved in your account, or choose to have it deleted automatically after a set period of time.</li>\n<li>Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time, such as advertising data in server logs.</li>\n<li>We keep some data until you delete your Google Account, such as information about how often you use our services.</li>\n<li>And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form.\nWe try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion.\nBecause of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.</p>\n<p>You can read more about Google\u2019s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.</p>Compliance &amp.\ncooperation with regulators<p>We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.</p>Data transfers<p>We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live.\nData protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others.\nRegardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.\nWe also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data.</p>\n<p>When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint.\nWe work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.</p>California requirements<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires specific disclosures for California residents.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how Google handles your information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We explain the categories of information Google collects and the sources of that information in Information Google collects.</li>\n<li>We explain how Google uses information in Why Google collects data.</li>\n<li>We explain when Google may share information in Sharing your information.\nGoogle does not sell your personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The CCPA also provides the right to request information about how Google collects, uses, and discloses your personal information.\nAnd it gives you the right to access your information and request that Google delete that information.\nFinally, the CCPA provides the right to not be discriminated against for

process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.</p>Application data cache<p>An application data cache is a data repository on a device.\nIt can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.</p>Browser web storage<p>Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device.\nWhen used in \"local storage\" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions.\nThis makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened.\nOne technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.</p>Cookies<p>A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.\nWhen you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser.\nCookies may store user preferences and other information.\nYou can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nHowever, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.\nLearn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps.</p>Device<p>A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services.\nFor example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.</p>Google Account<p>You may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address, and a password).\nThis account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others.\nYou can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.</p>IP address<p>Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address.\nThese numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks.\nAn IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.</p>Non-personally identifiable information<p>This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.</p>Personal information<p>This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.</p>Pixel tag<p>A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened.\nPixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.</p>Referrer URL<p>A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page.\nThe Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.</p>Sensitive personal information<p>This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.</p>Server logs<p>Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites.\nThese \u201cserver logs\u201d typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>\n<p>A typical log entry for a search for \u201ccars\u201d looks like this:</p>123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -<br>http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -<br>Firefox 1.0.7.\nWindows NT 5.1 -<br>740674ce2123e969<ul>\n<li>\n<code>123.45.67.89</code> is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user\u2019s ISP.\nDepending on the user\u2019s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.</li>\n<li>\n<code>25/Mar/2003 10:15:32</code> is the date and time of the query.</li>\n<li>\n<code>http://www.google.com/search?q=cars</code> is the requested URL, including the search query.</li>\n<li>\n<code>Firefox 1.0.7.\nWindows NT 5.1</code> is the browser and operating system being used.</li>\n<li>\n<code>740674ce2123a969</code> is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google.\n(Cookies can be deleted by users.\nIf the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they\u2019ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).</li>\n</ul>Unique identifiers<p>A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device.\nDifferent identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.</p>\n<p>Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising.\nFor example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language.\nYou can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nLearn more about how Google uses cookies.</p>\n<p>On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device.\nFor example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device\u2019s settings.\nUnique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone.\nFor example, a device\u2019s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.</p>Additional Contextads you\u2019ll find most useful<p>For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web.\nWe also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for \u201cpizza.\u201d Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.</p>advertising and research services on their behalf<p>For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns.\nWe only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don\u2019t reveal information about individual people.</p>Android device with Google apps<p>Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions.\nThese devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone\u2019s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.</p>combine the information we collect<p>Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you\u2019re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar.\nThis can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.\nLearn more</li>\n<li>If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name.\nThis feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.\nLearn more</li>\n<li>The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings.\nFor example, if you have searches stored in your Web &amp.\nApp Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity.\nLearn more</li>\n<li>If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant.\nFor example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.\nLearn more</li>\n</ul>customized search results<p>For example, when you\u2019re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web &amp.\nApp Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services.\nYou can learn more here.\nYou may also get customized search results even when you\u2019re signed out.\nIf you don\u2019t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.</p>deliver our services<p>Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video</li>\n<li>We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account</li>\n<li>Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, animations, and other creations that you can

goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions.\nWe use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.</li>\n</ul>detect abuse<p>When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action.\nIn certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.</p>devices<p>For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you\u2019d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play.\nWe also use this information to help protect your account.</p>ensure and improve<p>For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.</p>ensure our services are working as intended<p>For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems.\nAnd if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.</p>Information about things near your device<p>If you use Google\u2019s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps.\nIf you use Google\u2019s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength).\nAll these things help to determine your location.\nYou can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.\nLearn more</p>legal process, or enforceable governmental request<p>Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data.\nRespect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests.\nOur legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn\u2019t follow the correct process.\nLearn more in our Transparency Report.</p>make improvements<p>For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services.\nAnd that analysis can help us build better products.\nFor example, it may help us discover that it\u2019s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all.\nWe can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.</p>may link information<p>Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer.\nUsing our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites.\nFor example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.\nLearn more</p>partner with Google<p>There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\nLearn more</p>payment information<p>For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store.\nWe may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment.\nIn some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.</p>\n<p>We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you\u2019re not old enough to have a Google Account.\nLearn more</p>personalized ads<p>You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser.\nIf you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.\nLearn more</p>phone number<p>If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings.\nFor example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you

help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).</p>publicly accessible sources<p>For example, we may collect information that\u2019s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google\u2019s language models and build features like Google Translate.</p>rely on cookies to function properly<p>For example, we use a cookie called \u2018lbcs\u2019 that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser.\nBlocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.\nLearn more</p>safety and reliability<p>Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse.\nThis abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.</li>\n<li>The \u201clast account activity\u201d feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge.\nThis feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.\nLearn more</li>\n</ul>sensitive categories<p>When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity.\nFor example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.\u201d We don\u2019t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\nAnd we require the same from advertisers that use our services.</p>Sensor data from your device<p>Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement.\nFor example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.</p>servers around the world<p>For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.</p>services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages<p>Examples of these services include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Hangouts, for making domestic and international calls</li>\n<li>Google Voice, for making calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail</li>\n<li>Google Fi, for a phone plan</li>\n</ul>show trends<p>When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time.\nGoogle Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.\nLearn more</p>specific Google services<p>For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites.\nYou can also delete reviews you\u2019ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.</p>specific partners<p>For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies.\nAnother example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.\nLearn more about these partners and how they use your information.</p>synced with your Google Account<p>Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you\u2019ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.\nLearn more</p>the people who matter most to you

for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.</p>Views and interactions with content and ads<p>For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer.\nWe may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.</p>your activity on other sites and apps<p>This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google.\nMany websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services.\nFor example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube).\nThese services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.</p>",

attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li>Caste</li>\n<li>Disability</li>\n<li>Ethnicity</li>\n<li>Gender Identity and Expression</li>\n<li>Nationality</li>\n<li>Race</li>\n<li>Immigration Status</li>\n<li>Religion</li>\n<li>Sex/Gender</li>\n<li>Sexual Orientation</li>\n<li>Victims of a major violent event and their kin</li>\n<li>Veteran Status</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you find content that violates this policy, report it.\nInstructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines are available here.&nbsp;If you've found a few&nbsp;videos or comments that you would like to report, you can report the channel.</p> What this policy means for you If you're posting content <p>Don\u2019t post content on YouTube if the purpose of that content is to do one or more of the following.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Encourage violence against individuals or groups based&nbsp;on any of the attributes noted above.\nWe don\u2019t allow threats on YouTube, and we treat implied calls for violence as real threats.\nYou can learn more about our policies on threats and harassment.</li>\n<li>Incite hatred against individuals or groups based on any of the attributes noted above.</li>\n</ul> Other types of content that violates this policy <ul>\n<li>Dehumanizing individuals or groups by calling them subhuman, comparing them to animals, insects, pests, disease, or any other non-human entity.</li>\n<li>Praise or glorify violence against individuals or groups based on the attributes noted above.</li>\n<li>Use of racial, religious or other slurs and stereotypes that incite or promote hatred based on any of the attributes noted above.&nbsp;This can take the form of speech, text, or imagery promoting these stereotypes or treating them as factual.</li>\n<li>Claim that individuals or groups are physically or mentally inferior, deficient, or diseased based on any of the attributes noted above.\nThis includes statements that one group is less than another, calling them less intelligent, less capable, or damaged.</li>\n<li>Allege the superiority of a group over those with any of the attributes noted above to justify violence, discrimination, segregation, or exclusion.</li>\n<li>Conspiracy theories saying individuals or groups are evil, corrupt, or malicious based on any of the attributes noted above.</li>\n<li>Call for the subjugation or domination over individuals or groups based on any of the attributes noted above.</li>\n<li>Deny that a well-documented, violent event took place.</li>\n<li>Attacks&nbsp;on a person\u2019s emotional, romantic and/or sexual attraction to another person.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Content containing hateful supremacist propaganda including the recruitment of new members or requests for financial support for their ideology.</li>\n<li>Music videos promoting hateful supremacism in the lyrics, metadata, or imagery.</li>\n</ul> Educational content <p>We may allow content that includes hate speech if the primary purpose is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic in nature.\nThis is not a free pass to promote hate speech.\nExamples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>A documentary about a hate group:</strong> Educational content that isn\u2019t supporting the group or promoting ideas would be allowed.\nA documentary promoting violence or hatred wouldn\u2019t be allowed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>A documentary about the scientific study of humans:</strong> A documentary about how theories have changed over time, even if it includes theories about the inferiority or superiority of specific groups, would be allowed because it\u2019s educational.\nWe won\u2019t allow a documentary claiming there's&nbsp;scientific evidence today that an individual or group is inferior or subhuman.</li>\n<li>Historical footage of an event, like WWII, which doesn't&nbsp;promote violence or hatred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments,
