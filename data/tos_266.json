ARBITRATION.\nWAIVER.\nINDEMNIFICATION</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our goal is to resolve any disputes amicably and quickly and we encourage you to contact us and explain your complaint as soon as it arises.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Governing Law</strong>.\nThis Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the interpretation and enforcement of, and proceedings pursuant to, Section&nbsp;20(b) of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9&nbsp;U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16), and we expressly recognize and acknowledge the continuing applicability of our right to contract for binding arbitration and waiver of any right to participate in a class Action or jury trial, as set out in Section&nbsp;20(b) hereof.&nbsp.\nThe application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.&nbsp.\nYou agree that any claim or dispute you may have against the Company must be resolved in a federal or state court located in New York, NY, USA or as described in the Arbitration provision below.&nbsp.\nBoth you and the Company retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm.&nbsp.\nYou agree that the state or federal courts located in New York, NY, USA are the exclusive forum for any proceeding to confirm or vacate an arbitration award rendered in accordance with Section&nbsp;20(b) hereof (or for any proceeding seeking relief in aid of such arbitration) or in the event that the Arbitration provision below is for any reason held to be unenforceable.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration</strong>.\nREAD THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM THE COMPANY.&nbsp.\nFor any dispute with the Company, you agree to first contact us within 30 days of when the dispute arises at legal@spark.net and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.&nbsp.\nIn the unlikely event that the Company has not been able to informally resolve a dispute it has with you within 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or other equitable relief described in Section&nbsp;20(a)) arising out of or in connection with or relating to the Services or this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof, including disputes related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this agreement to arbitrate (collectively, \u201cClaims\u201d), by binding arbitration by the Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services (\u201cJAMS\u201d) under the JAMS Optional Expedited Procedures then in effect, except as provided herein.&nbsp.\nJAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com.&nbsp.\nYou will have the right to participate in the selection of the arbitrator, who may be selected by mutual agreement of the parties or by the procedures provided by JAMS if the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator.&nbsp.\nUnless the parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the location where the arbitration proceedings will be conducted or a retired federal or state judicial officer who presided in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in New York, NY, USA (or the nearest office to Santa Clara County), unless you request a hearing in your hometown area or you and the Company agree otherwise.&nbsp.\nThe language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.&nbsp.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by JAMS rules, but if you are unable to pay any of them, the Company will pay them for you.&nbsp.\nThe award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp.\nThe Company will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims or defenses are frivolous.&nbsp.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party\u2019s data security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights.&nbsp.\nYou may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process.&nbsp.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and the Company submit to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER</strong>.\nYOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.&nbsp.\nTHIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS.&nbsp.\nYOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Indemnity</strong>.\nYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, managers, agents, contractors, partners and employees harmless from any loss, liability, claim, damages, costs, debts, expenses or demand, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, due to or arising from (i)&nbsp;your use of or access to the Services, including any data or content transmitted or received by you, or your inability to use the Services.\n(ii)&nbsp;any claim or damages that arise as a result of any of your User Content or any User Content that is submitted via your account.\n(iii)&nbsp;your conduct in connection with the Services or our users, (iv)&nbsp;your violation of any of the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation your breach of any of the representations and warranties above,

Services with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code or (viii)&nbsp;your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability</strong>.\nIf any clause within this Section&nbsp;20 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this section and the remainder of the section will be given full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>TERMINATION</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unless otherwise provided, this Agreement is effective upon your first use of the Services and shall remain in effect until it is terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Termination by the Company</strong>.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may suspend, deactivate or terminate your account and your right to use the Services and may block or prevent your access to and use of the Services at any time in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, without explanation and without notice (including without limitation blocking users or Members from certain IP addresses).&nbsp.\nWe also reserve the right to remove or block access to your account information, User Content or data from our Services and any other records at any time at our sole discretion.&nbsp.\nIn the event that we determine that your access to any of the Services is terminated or suspended for cause, such as due to any breach of this Agreement, flagged conduct or content, third party complaints or the implementation of our repeat infringer policy, you agree that all fees then paid to the Company by you will be nonrefundable, except as otherwise provided by law, and all outstanding or pending payments under the terms of your subscription will immediately be due and payable.&nbsp.\nAll decisions as to the refundability of the fees are in the Company\u2019s sole discretion.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you may dispute any refunds of fees pursuant to Section&nbsp;20 of this Agreement.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Termination by You</strong>.\nIn addition to any right to cancel your subscription pursuant to Section&nbsp;22, below, you may

"url": "https://docviewer.zoosk.com/legal-cookiepolicy-en.html", "xpath": "//body", "text": " Cookie PolicyCOOKIE POLICYSummary<p>This cookie policy explains what cookies are and how we use them on our services through our websites, as well as our products and applications (including Zoosk\u2019s mobile applications, downloadable products and applications and pages operated by Zoosk on social networking sites and other platforms) (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d).\nIt also explains how we use other technologies for purposes that are similar to our use of cookies.\nWe encourage you to read the full policy so that you can understand what information is collected by us through cookies and how that information is used.</p>What are cookies?<p>Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your browsing device (such as a computer or smartphone) when you visit a website.\nCookies can be recognized by the website that downloaded them or other websites that use the same cookies.\nThis helps websites know if the browsing device has visited them before.</p>What are web beacons?<p>Some of our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes also called clear gifs or pixel tags).\nWeb beacons are usually a small image located on a webpage or email that you are viewing.\nThe request your Internet-connected device makes to fetch the image from the server/computer it is stored on is recorded and provides us with information such as the IP address of the computer wanting to view the image, the time the image was viewed, and the type of browser viewing the image.\nThis information is available to any website you visit.\nFor example, we are able to use it to help us deliver cookies, count visits, prevent fraud and to tell if an email or advertisement has been opened and acted upon.\nIn short, cookies work together with web beacons to accomplish the functions and purposes described herein.</p>What are cookies used for?<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how our website is being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your browsing experience.\nCookies can also help ensure advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>What types of cookies does Zoosk use?<p>The types of cookies used on most websites can generally be put into one of the following categories: strictly necessary, analytics, functionality, advertising, social media and fraud prevention.\nIn order to provide you with the best browsing experience, Zoosk and our third party partners may use cookies from all of these categories.\nYou can find out more about the cookies we use from each of the categories in the table below.</p>Strictly Necessary CookiesThese cookies are essential to make our website work.\nThey enable you to move around our site and use its features.\nWithout these

the social media service provider\u2019s website for further details about how they use cookies.Fraud Prevention CookiesThese cookie files, flash storage tokens, smart phone SDK applications, or other software on the end user\u2019s device contain a unique identifier.\nSubsequently, in transactions between you and us, that identifier is accessed and checked through third party databases to determine if the device has been associated with suspected fraud or abuse reported by other online service providers in connection with prior transactions involving that device.<p>&nbsp;</p>How long will cookies stay on my browsing device?<p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a \u201cpersistent\u201d or \u201csession\u201d cookie.\nSession
