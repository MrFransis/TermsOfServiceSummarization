\"<strong>our</strong>\") provides the services rendered to you through the ResearchGate website available at https://www.researchgate.net, and through any of its web pages and associated applications which may be available on multiple devices, including mobile applications (\"<strong>Service</strong>\").This Privacy Policy sets forth the collection and use practices of ResearchGate for personal data we process in the course of providing the Service.Our mission is to connect the world of science and make research open to all.\nConnections can only be established when potential connections and commonalities are known and connecting lines can be drawn.\nOpenness can only be achieved with comprehensive accessibility.\nOur Service takes your work and activities on the Service into account to help connect you with other individuals who are relevant to you and recommend relevant content.\nWe also gather information from external sources, in order to disseminate as much relevant scientific content as possible to drive science forward.\nAny natural or legal person who, as a recipient of the Service, accesses or uses the Service for any purpose is a User (\"<strong>User</strong>\", \"<strong>you</strong>\").\nOur registered Users (\"<strong>Members</strong>\") share their professional identities and credentials, display their academic publications, engage and collaborate with their networks, exchange knowledge and professional insights, post and view relevant content, and discover business and career opportunities.\nSome content is also visible to unregistered or logged-out Users (\"<strong>Visitors</strong>\").\nA User could be a Member or a Visitor.\nAn Author (\"<strong>Author</strong>\") is a natural person who, for the purpose of our Service, is a member of the scientific community by for example being an author/editor of a publication, being an advisor or recipient of scientific funding.\nAn Author is not necessarily a User or Member of our Service.ResearchGate reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, in particular, to reflect changes in market conditions affecting ResearchGate\u2019s activities, changes in technology, changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements, and changes in ResearchGate\u2019s system capabilities.\nIf we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify Members by email or other reasonable means, including through notifications on our Service.\nIf you object to any new version, you should stop using our Service and/or close your account.\nIf you continue to use our Service after having been provided with such notice you will be deemed to have acknowledged the Privacy Policy.2.\nInformation we process and how we process it<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic data processed</strong>Certain data will be processed when you access the Service, to resolve the technical request of your device, display the site and maintain the safety and security of our systems.\nThis data is stored in so-called logs and comprise the following:<ul>\n<li>IP addresses and your mobile device's Identifier for Advertising (IDFA);</li>\n<li>the type of computer or mobile device you are using including operating system and version;</li>\n<li>the types of browser you are using, the language, and your country;</li>\n<li>referring and exit pages and URLs;</li>\n<li>platform type;</li>\n<li>the number of clicks on a page or feature, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages or parts of pages;</li>\n<li>domain names and;</li>\n<li>information collected for performance purposes (e.g.\naverage load, render time of pages, etc.).</li>\n</ul>Even though IP addresses and mobile identifiers are generally considered personal data, we can not derive any direct conclusions about your identity from such data.Our legal basis for processing this personal data is Article 6 (1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nThe data processed is very basic data, and does not contain directly identifiable information about you.\nWe have a legitimate interest in being able to provide a functioning, reliable and accessible website and resolve your server-request in an appropriate manner.All of our pages are secured using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology, which encrypts data transmitted between our servers and your end devices.\nWe also apply other suitable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal data we process</strong>In order to provide you with functionalities, we need to process certain data and/or information relating to you:<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Registration and maintenance of your Member account</strong>If you choose to create a Member account on our Service, you will be required, during the registration process, to provide your first and last name, an email address, and a password.\nYou will receive a confirmation email.\nYour Member account will be confirmed after you have clicked on the respective link in the account activation email.\nYou may also be invited to associate certain information we present to you with your account, such as articles, institutional affiliation, and biographical information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other personal data</strong>During the registration process or when updating your profile, you can choose to provide other information that can be used to identify and/or contact you, including for example, a profile picture, your Twitter account handle or your city of residence.\nYou may also be invited or required to provide information about you, including, for example, demographic information, such as occupation, and research vita, education, authorship of articles, academic or research expertise or interests, conferences you have attended, groups of which you are a member, information regarding your professional and academic career, academic degree, your previous roles and jobs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third-party connectors</strong>You can choose to create an account using your Facebook, LinkedIn or Google account and subsequently use that third-party platform\u2019s credentials to log in to your ResearchGate account.\nUsing this option means that you are allowing ResearchGate to request and use certain data from the third-party account.\nFor Google, this involves us processing your email address.\nFor LinkedIn, we will process your email address, first and last name, and profile picture.\nFor Facebook, we will process your email address and public profile information.\nThe third-party platform might ask for your consent to share this data with ResearchGate.\nAs the personal data we might process was originally collected by the third-party platform, the initial data processing and sharing of the data with ResearchGate are governed by the privacy policy of such third-party platform.\nPlease refer to the relevant third-party platform and/or its settings, if you want to deactivate the connection between ResearchGate and the third-party platform.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications with us</strong>When you communicate with us, you may provide us with your name, contact details, and other personal data as part of your communication, as well as the content of your message itself.\nSimilarly, when we communicate with you, we will process your personal information, such as your email address.\nFor some of our emails, we also process information indicating whether you have opened the email.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications through the Service</strong>Many communications that you initiate through our Service (e.g.\ninvitation sent to a non-Member) will list your name in the header of the message.\nOther communications that you initiate through the Service, like a request for a full-text, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address.\nOnce you have mutually connected with an individual, contact information you choose to include in your researcher profile will be shared with that individual.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Recommendations</strong>In order to provide our recommendation features, we process contact and bibliographical data, information pertaining to your work, usage frequency, type of devices you use to use the Service, including browser, operating system and mobile device, research items you consulted, interaction with particular pages or parts of pages, and number of clicks on a page or feature, in order to provide the Service in a way that is tailored to your interests.\nAlso, based on the personal data you provide, statistical evaluations, mathematic operations, and predictions may help us infer other information about you and support our recommendation features.\nFor example, if you were to add several research items to the Service over the course of several years, we may infer that you are not a junior researcher anymore.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third party providers</strong>When you choose to benefit from a service or offer presented by ResearchGate on behalf of a third party, you may share personal data with ResearchGate to enable us to pass it on to the third party.\nThe nature of personal data will depend on the particular service or offer, but might include your name, email address and affiliation.\nWe do not share any of this personal data with any third party unless you explicitly allow us to do so.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment data</strong>If you choose to purchase a premium product or service from ResearchGate that is subject to a fee, we will process the personal data that you provide in order to complete your order, such as your billing address.\nResearchGate does not process any credit card information itself, however we do retain your name and address so we may generate and send you an invoice.\nCredit card information is collected and processed by a third-party provider, namely Stripe.\nStripe processes this data as an independent controller to process the payment.\nFor details about the data processing undertaken by Stripe, please see its Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Security</strong>We process the number of profile pages users view to detect and prevent data harvesting.\nWe also process your IP address to filter out suspicious requests.\nIf you are a Member, we store your full IP address in connection with your account registration request and your current last login.\nOtherwise, your login activities are only stored in connection with your truncated IP addresses.\nAlso, we process information about the device, its operating system and the browser you are using for your current session.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Statistics</strong>We use activity data, such as number of read publications, projects and number of citations, to generate statistics, which pertain to reading behavior or achievements.\nFor example, we may use such activity data in order to calculate and display a read count on an individual publication page.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>3.\nHow we use data we collect about youThe following explanations will provide you with information about how we use the personal data that we collect about you, and our legal basis for doing so under the GDPR.\nGenerally speaking, we may, pursuant to Art.\n6(1)(f) GDPR use your data based on our legitimate interests<ul>\n<li>to provide and improve our Service;</li>\n<li>to perform internal quality checks;</li>\n<li>to prevent, detect, process and investigate malfunctions, incidents, fraudulent or other illegal activities, or mitigate the risk of occurrence of the aforementioned events;</li>\n<li>to ensure network and information security;</li>\n<li>to create statistics on access channels and the use of our Service;</li>\n<li>to contact you, if requested by you or if necessary to fulfil the contract or permitted by law;</li>\n<li>enforcing obligations owed to us, and contractual terms and conditions and;</li>\n<li>accounting, risk management and record keeping</li>\n</ul>Also, pursuant to Art.\n6(1)(c) GDPR we may use your data to comply with legal obligations, e.g.\nto observe retention periods required by trade or tax law or to comply with obligations to disclose data based on a legally binding court decision or official order.More specifically, we may use your data for the following purposes.<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>ResearchGate account</strong>The personal data you provide in connection with registering for your Member account will be used to create, maintain, and secure your account.\nBy creating a Member account, you will benefit from functionalities and services that are not available to Visitors.\nAny personal data you provide in addition to the required data to register for an account, will facilitate your ability to get into contact with other Members, promote yourself and your research, and receive more relevant recommendations from our recommendation services.<ul>\n<li>Our legal basis for this processing this data is Art.\n6 (1)(b) GDPR.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications</strong>Depending on the way you are communicating with us, we may use your name, email address, telephone number, and the content of your previous correspondence to respond to you and provide assistance.<ul>\n<li>Our legal basis for this processing is Art.\n6 (1)(b) or (f) GDPR.\nAs a public-facing company, we have a legitimate interest in being able to receive, process, and respond to enquiries.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transactional emails</strong>Provided you have not opted out from receiving transactional emails from us, we will use your email address to send you emails about relevant developments on the Service concerning for example, your network, new features, publications, projects, updates from the Q&amp;A section, and emails regarding your professional career.You can opt out from receiving transactional emails at any time by clicking the \"unsubscribe\" link within an email or by visiting your account settings.<ul>\n<li>Legal basis for this processing is Art.\n6 (1)(b) GDPR.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sponsored emails</strong>Where you have provided your prior consent to receiving sponsored emails, we will use your email address to send you such emails.\nWhere legally allowed, we will also use your email address to send you sponsored emails without your prior consent.In any case, you can opt out from receiving sponsored emails at any time by clicking the \"unsubscribe\" link within an email or visiting the \"notification settings\" in your account.<ul>\n<li>Our legal basis for this processing is Art.\n6 (1)(a) or (f) GDPR.\nWhenever we rely on our legitimate interest to process your email address for sending sponsored emails, we do so as it is in our best interest to make the Service as helpful and meaningful to you as possible, which may also mean that third-party content will be taken into consideration.\nIn addition, these email campaigns help us in monetizing our Service, so we can keep offering it to you.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Offer Members tailored content</strong>Using our recommendation technology, we process your personal data or infer information in order to provide the Service in a way that is tailored to your interests.\nThis enables us to customize the features and offerings ResearchGate provides to you through the Service.\nFor example, we provide dynamic web pages that are individually adapted to you.\nWe may present content recommendations such as research items that are \"Suggested for you\" and/or recommendations regarding other individuals such as \"Who to follow\" or \"Related researchers\" (other Members) you can follow.\nIn the same way that you benefit from content and individuals recommended to you, you and your content might be recommended to other Members and therefore might appear in their experience, for example in their home feed.\nWe derive learnings from Members\u2019 interactions with tailored content and suggestions and subsequently take them into account to improve any further offerings of tailored content.<ul>\n<li>Our legal basis for this processing is Art.\n6 (1)(b) or (f) GDPR.\nWe have a legitimate interest in providing the best user experience based on the individual needs.\nThis processing does not conflict with your interests as it corresponds with a person\u2019s reasonable expectations when signing up for an account.\nThe processing has no negative impact for our Members but is in their interests as it allows ResearchGate to provide them a tailored service.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Offer Members tailored advertising content and relevant jobs</strong>As a Member, we aim to offer you advertising content that is most relevant to you.\nIn this context, we use, whether separately or combined, the personal data you provide, we collect, or we infer from your use of the Service and the Internet and also contextual information of the site you are currently visiting.\nThis enables us to display advertisements that best match your particular interests, and job suggestions that are relevant to your scientific field, experience and research.\nFor further information about advertisements on the Service, please refer to section Advertisements on ResearchGate below.<ul>\n<li>Our legal basis for this processing is Art.\n6 (1)(f) GDPR.\nAdvertising is a ubiquitous part of the Internet, but we believe that advertising, when done well, is a good thing.\nWe aim to display the most relevant and most helpful advertisements to you.\nTo be able to do this, we must take your interests, your journey, and some of your personal data into account.\nWithout this processing, the advertisements we would be able to disseminate would not be different from random advertisements you can see everywhere in the Internet.\nWe take great care in choosing the right advertising partners and limiting the personal data we process.\nThe personal data that we process for this purpose will not be shared with any third party except our technical service provider (see section Third party services for analytics, measurement and ad delivery), and will only support our purposes.\nGiven that we limit the data processed, do not share it with other third parties, and process your personal data to display only relevant advertisements to you, we believe that our legitimate interest to monetize our platform and therefore continue to provide you with the Service outweighs.\nWe believe our Service is a service to researchers, research, and science as a whole.\nAmong other things, we make worldwide collaboration possible, and facilitate the solving of important scientific questions.\nOur mission is an important one.\nBut this mission must be financed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Offer Visitors tailored advertising content and jobs</strong>As a Visitor, we also aim to offer you advertising content that is most relevant to you.\nIn the case of Visitors, this means that the third parties delivering advertisements may take into account the context of the current site you are visiting.\nFor further information about advertisements on the Service, please refer to section Advertisements on ResearchGate below.<ul>\n<li>Our legal basis for this processing is Art.\n6 (1)(f) GDPR and where applicable Art.\n6 (1)(a) GDPR.\nBecause some parts of our Service are available to everyone, even those who don\u2019t have an account with us, we believe that wherever we haven\u2019t asked you for your consent, the data processing conducted is of such limited effect on you, that our interest to monetize the platform and therefore continue to provide the Service also to non- Members, is legitimate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Candidate search</strong>A limited amount of your profile information (including only some information from the overview and research tabs) will be visible for recruiters with a Recruiter Account on the Service.\nIf the information on your profile matches the search criteria entered by a recruiter in our candidate search feature, this limited version of your profile may show up in their search results.\nRecruiters may choose to contact you through the messaging functionality provided within the feature.\nYour inclusion in candidate search, including being contacted by recruiters, is fully under your control.\nYou can choose to block specific recruiters, or opt out from being included in candidate search and contacted by any recruiters by changing your privacy settings at any time.<ul>\n<li>Legal basis for this processing is Art.\n6 (1)(b) GDPR.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ensure the security of your personal data</strong>We process your personal data in order to avoid its accidental or unlawful destruction, as well as its loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure.\nFor example, we process the number of profile pages you and others view so as to detect and prevent data harvesting.\nLikewise, we truncate the last octet of your IP address to prevent you from being identified.<ul>\n<li>Our legal basis for this processing is Art.\n6 (1)(c) and (f) GDPR.\nWe are legally obliged to secure data from unauthorized loss and alteration and it is also in our mutual interest to ensure data security.\nAs this primarily serves the purpose of protecting your data there are no overriding interests on your part.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Generate statistics</strong>We use your personal data to generate statistics which pertain to reading/search behavior and achievements.\nWe also generate statistics for internal purposes in order to constantly improve the Service and its features.\nWe also conduct research and development to maintain quality and improve our Service and the User experience.<ul>\n<li>Our legal basis for this processing is Art.\n6 (1)(f) GDPR.\nWe have a legitimate interest to assess and evaluate the traffic on our site to improve our Service.\nSuch improvement is also in the interest of our Users as it allows them to always benefit from the best Service we can offer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>4.\nHow we use relevant publicly available dataWe also process personal data relating to Authors that is publicly available and relevant for our Service.We may obtain a variety of information about Authors from publicly available sources, such as information regarding previous research published, the publication itself (including personal data too) and other functions or references of an Author related to a publication.\nWe may also process information related to an Author, to create a record of their body of scientific contributions, or that might help understand professional connections between Authors and Members.\nWhere an Author's scientific work was publicly or privately funded, we may also process this publicly available information.When we collect publicly available materials we do not have a way to ensure that personal data in such materials has been processed in accordance with the applicable laws.\nHowever, if you notify us that your personal data contained in such materials is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of applicable data protection laws, we may delete it upon verification of your identity.The public data processed may be associated with an account when an Author chooses to become a Member.<ul>\n<li>Our legal basis for this processing is Art.\n6 (1)(f) GDPR.\nThe data processed is publicly available data.\nAlso, the data processed has to be processed to provide a correct and complete scientific picture.\nOur legitimate interest is to provide a comprehensive and accurate repository of scientific work, contributions and success.\nWithout processing additional public data, we could not achieve these aims.\nFurthermore, since we offer the possibility to connect this data with an account, we provide Members a convenient way to establish an account that is as complete as possible, without the effort of manually adding the information themselves.</li>\n</ul>5.\nInformation we process when using technologies like cookies and pixelsWe and service providers acting on our behalf store log files and use tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, and local shared objects, also known as flash cookies, to collect information relating to you and your use of the Service.<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Basics</strong>\"Cookies\" are small files that enable us to store and collect specific information related to you and your use of the Service on your computer or other end devices.\nThey help us to analyze the number of people who use the Service, usage frequency, User behavior and advertising effectiveness, to increase security and to tailor our Service and advertisements to your needs and preferences.<ul>\n<li>This website uses so-called \"session cookies\" which after your session on the website session ends, will automatically be deleted.\n</li>\n<li>This website also uses \"persistent cookies\" to record information about repeat Users of the Service.\nPersistent cookies are designed to help us continually improve the products and services we offer you and to ensure the quality of our services.\n\"Persistent cookies\" remain for a certain pre-defined period of time and are recognized by us when you return to the Service (or one of our partner sites).</li>\n<li>You can edit the settings of your browser to prevent cookies from being stored, to limit the storage of cookies to certain websites, or such that your browser informs you every time a cookie is sent.\nYou can also delete cookies at any time.\nHowever, please note that if cookies are deactivated you will not be able to take advantage of some of ResearchGate\u2019s features.\nFor specific help on how to delete Cookies with the help of your browser, please consult respective help sections, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Safari.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cookie table for ResearchGate</strong>ResearchGate use cookies for various purposes, but cookies primarily help us provide, protect and improve our products and services, tailor advertising and content, and better understand the use of our services.\nThe following table will provide you

technology</strong>In addition to cookies, this website uses so-called pixels, web beacons, clear GIFs, and other similar mechanisms (\"<strong>Pixels</strong>\").\nA Pixel is an image file or link to an image file added to the website code but not sent to your end device.\nPixels are largely used for the same reasons as cookies, i.e.\nto analyze the number of people who use our Service or, if the User's email program allows HTML, to determine whether and when an email was opened.\nPixels help us to check and optimize the effectiveness of our Service and offers as well as advertising campaigns served on ResearchGate.\nPixels do not provide us with personal data.\nPixels are usually used in conjunction with cookies.\nIf you have deactivated the use of cookies in your browser, then Pixels will only report an anonymous website visit.We also use Pixel-based and cookie-based conversion tracking technologies to, for example, measure the success of advertising campaigns served on the Service.\nTo this end we use technologies provided by Google (see below section Google Services).</li>\n</ol>6.\nAdvertisements on ResearchGateWe display advertisements on our Service so we can continue to offer many of our features for free.\nWe generate revenue by disseminating advertisements.\nWe allow selected partners to advertise their products, content, jobs and more, on our Service.<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Basics</strong>When advertisers or ad networks place advertisements on our Service, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our Service:<ul>\n<li>performance data (such as the number of clicks on an advertisement);</li>\n<li>aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other Users collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (such as Users who are located in Berlin);</li>\n<li>certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, cookieIDs, non-persistent device identifiers such as Identifiers for Advertising (IDFAs).\nand</li>\n<li>other contextual data about our dissemination and your potential perception of advertisements.</li>\n</ul>Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons (see explanations above), and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.<br>The information collected may be used to:<ul>\n<li>measure how effective advertisements are;</li>\n<li>offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements that are more relevant to you.\nand/or</li>\n<li>undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other User activity to improve your experience.</li>\n</ul>After clicking on a third-party advertisement, you may no longer be on a site hosted by ResearchGate.\nResearchGate is not responsible for any third party, or its affiliates or agents, failing to use your personal data in accordance with such third party's privacy policy, or any contractual or other legal obligations to which such third party, its affiliates or agents, may be subject.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Logged-in experience</strong>The advertising content shown to logged-in Members is served by ResearchGate itself using the help of third party technology providers, such as Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, GoogleDV 360 and Lotame.\nInformation on those service providers can be found at section Third party services for analytics, measurement and ad delivery.In the case of these advertisements, ResearchGate has a direct relationship with the advertiser.\nWe take great care when choosing such advertising partners.\nWe allow them to target you based on pre-defined segments of which you may be a part.\nThese segments are created by ResearchGate and may take into consideration your profile information and/or contextual information.\nFor example, a segment might take into account your skills, disciplines, career level, current location, or what page on the Service you are currently visiting.\nWe may also infer data such as gender or age group (for example 20-35 male) to assign you to a segment.\nAn example of a segment that an advertising partner could target is: \"Scientist, Biotechnology, EU, on a publication page containing a publication about a virus.\" Targeting this segment would mean that only Members who are part of this segment will see that advertiser\u2019s advertisement on the Service.By using this information and these segments, we and our advertising partners are able to present relevant advertisements to you.\nWe will take your previous interactions with advertisements into account when determining whether to present you with subsequent advertisements and in subsequent segmentation efforts.\nThis is another way that we try to avoid providing you with advertisements that are not of interest to you.ResearchGate might also re-target you with advertisements of our advertising partners on third-party platforms.\nFor this re-targeting, we don\u2019t share any of your personal data with our advertising partners.\nRather, we provide Google DV 360 (see below) with an anonymized (i.e.\nhashed) value of your ResearchGate cookie ID.\nGoogle DV 360 might have the same hash value already in its systems, received from a third-party platform.\nWhenever this is the case, we could present you with an advertisement from one of our advertising partners on a third-party platform.You can opt out from receiving cookie-based tailored advertisements on the Service and retargeting at any time, by clicking here.\nNote that this opt out will place a cookie on your device so we can remember your choice, which means if you delete your cookies at any point in time, you would have to opt out again.Please also note that opting out from ResearchGate cookie-based tailored advertising will not have the effect of disabling advertisements completely.\nFor the delivery of advertisements, we will still take into account the context of the page you are currently visiting and personalize advertisements based on information other than cookie-based information.Information about the respective cookies we are using for ResearchGate served advertisements can be found in the cookie table above.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Logged-out experience</strong>A great amount of information, particularly publication pages and the Q&amp;A section of our Service, are available also for Visitors.\nThese parts of our Service are also free for everyone.\nAs a result, logged-out Visitors will find advertisements there.Primarily, ResearchGate enables third-party networks and platforms with which we have a business relationship to disseminate advertisements

to navigate it:<ul>\n<li>Under \"More options\", you will find a list of data processing purpose-stacks.\nBy clicking on these, you can find out what each stack specifically consists of, according legal descriptions and a corresponding list of partners that process data under this purpose stack.\nYou can choose to allow the stack or just parts of the stack.\nIf you prefer to not allow a stack or specific purposes, you don't have to do anything.</li>\n<li>Clicking \"Agree\" has the effect of explaining consent for all data processing and according partners.</li>\n<li>Any settings you made will be stored when you click \"Save and exit\".</li>\n<li>If you don't want to explain any consent, you just have to click \"Save &amp.\nexit\", since data processing that requires prior consent is default \u201cOFF\u201d.</li>\n<li>\"Additional links\" will refer you to this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>Under \"More options\" \u2013 \"Partners\" you will find a list of partners, their purposes and respective descriptions, as well as links pointing to the respective partners privacy policies.\nHere you can make specific choices regarding each partner.\nSome personal data is processed without your prior consent, but you have the right to object.</li>\n<li>Under \"More options\" \u2013 \"Legitimate interest\" you will find a list of \"Legitimate interest purposes\" and \"Legitimate interest vendors\".\nWhen you unfold the legitimate interest purposes, the legal description and the partner relying on legitimate interest for this purpose is provided.\nWhen you unfold the description of a specific partner, you can also find out for which purposes, the specific partner relies on Legitimate interest.\nWhere processing of personal data is being executed without your prior approval but with the legal basis \"Legitimate Interest\", you have the right to object.\nUnder \"More options\" \u2013 \"Legitimate interest\", you can explain your objection for each purpose and each partner, but you can also click \"Object all\".</li>\n<li>Most important for you: unless you granted consent by clicking \"Agree\" in our consent modal, our partners will only be able to process very limited personal data and only if they can claim legitimate interest to do so.</li>\n<li>At any time, you can withdraw any consent given or modify your consent.\nYou can do so by re-prompting the consent modal by clicking here.</li>\n<li>Please note: even if you have not provided your consent, you will still be presented with advertisements, but such advertisements will not be tailored to

usage behavior on our Service.\nGoogle Analytics is a web analysis service provided by Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.\nFor this web analysis service, Google uses cookies on our website to systematically evaluate the interactions of Users on our Service.\nThe information generated by the cookie about the use of our Service by the user (e.g.\ntruncated IP address, website currently visited, referrer, duration of stay, and frequency of the call of the website) is transferred to a Google server in Ireland.\nIn addition, a transfer of the data to another Google server in the USA is possible.\nGoogle will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Service, compiling reports on website activity for us, and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage.\nThe processed data can be used to create pseudonymous user profiles of Users.\nThe data is deleted after 26 months.\nBy activating IP anonymization on our website, your IP address is truncated before it is forwarded within the member states of the European Union or other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\nOnly in exceptional cases will your full IP address be forwarded to a Google server in Ireland and possibly the USA and shortened there.\nGoogle will not combine your IP address collected via Google Analytics with other data that Google holds.\nTo opt out from Google Analytics, please click here.\nIf you delete your cookies, you have to click this link again.<br>Our use of Google Analytics

Google DV 360, including the tool \"Display &amp.\nVideo\" to be able to recognize you on third-party websites.\nFor this purpose, the Google Display &amp.\nVideo 360 will place cookies on your device which will enable recognition of you in the Google advertising network.\nWe are subsequently able to present you advertisements on the basis of your surfing behavior on third-party platforms.\nThis service also enables us to evaluate delivered advertisements and optimize them.</li>\n<li>Google Ad Manager enables the control and optimization of advertisements on our Service.\nIt also helps to

be shared are located outside of the European Economic Area, in countries whose data protection laws may not be as extensive as those which apply to us.If we transfer your personal data to countries

easy for you to read all our legal terms, policies, and community guidelines from one place.\nHere, you can access all the information you need to understand your rights when using ResearchGate, and make sure you're respecting the rights of others too.If you're using one of our business products, this is where you'll find the terms and guidelines that apply to your use of that product and any related features or services.You can access downloadable copies of the current and previous versions of our terms and policies here.TermsPrivacyCopyrightCommunityBusinessLast updated: January 8, 2018Intellectual Property PolicyResearchGate was developed by scientists to enable collaboration, sharing of content and communication among scientists, researchers, authors, institutions and other professionals.\nWe respect the intellectual property rights of others and ask that you do the same.\nWe have a process for submitting complaints regarding content posted by our members.\nOur policy and procedures are described below.Posting content on ResearchGateAs a member, when you post full-text articles or supplementary materials on ResearchGate, you do not transfer or assign copyright to us.\u2002Rather, you make the content available to the public through ResearchGate.\nYou retain the right to remove such content from ResearchGate at any time, or to archive your content so it is available only to you and your co-author(s).\nYou may also remove content from appearing on your profile page.Our platform enables the private archiving and public posting of various types of content.\nIf you choose to privately archive or publicly post content, we encourage you to first confirm your rights before doing so.\nThis applies to posting content to your own profile as well as other places on the platform, such as in a Q&amp;A forum or a project.\nAs we do not have any information about rights you may hold, or any license terms or other restrictions which might apply to such content, we necessarily rely on you to understand your rights and act accordingly.\nFor this reason, we request that you fully investigate and confirm that you have sufficient rights to post particular content to ResearchGate before you do so.\nAs a general matter, if you are an author publishing in a journal, you may be allowed to publish certain versions of your article, but not others, and privately share certain content with others.\nHowever, many journals restrict publication of final versions and impose limitations on private sharing.Your starting point for understanding your rights is the agreement(s) you have with your publisher or other rights owner.\nIf you\u2019re still unsure about what you\u2019re allowed to share on ResearchGate, we recommend that you get in touch directly with your publisher.\nThere are other resources available that you might also find useful in understanding your rights, such as How Can I Share It.\nWe also provide some general information in our Help Center.Complaints regarding content posted on ResearchGateIt is our policy to respond to notices of claimed copyright infringement submitted by rights owners in accordance with the notice and takedown procedures found in section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (United States) and the European eCommerce Directive, detailed below.\nOur Designated Agent for receiving notices of claimed copyright and other intellectual property infringement is:Copyright AgentResearchGate GmbHChausseestr.\n20Berlin, Germany 10115Email: copyright@researchgate.netTelephone: +49 (0) 30 200051-100Please be aware that, regardless of whether we disable access to or remove the content complained about, we may forward your written notification, including your contact information, to the member who posted the content, and/or take other reasonable steps to notify the member that we have received notice of an alleged violation of copyright or intellectual property rights.Please also remember that, if you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, you are initiating a legal process.\nAny notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury.\nA false notice or counter-notice may give rise to personal liability.\nYou may therefore wish to seek the advice of legal counsel before submitting a notice or counter-notice.Copyright and other intellectual property infringement notification requirementsPlease note that if you are not a copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of a copyright owner, we must ask that you contact the copyright owner and ask them to submit a notice of claimed infringement.\nIf you are a copyright owner, US, European and other laws require that your notice of claimed infringement follow a specific form.\nThe easiest way to do this is to complete our simple form and send it to copyright@researchgate.net:NOCI FormIt provides us with a required signature and information about you or your company that we will keep on file.\nYou can save a copy of the form to prevent you having to fill in your contact information next time.\nIf you do not wish to use our form, you can use your own form or send an email to copyright@researchgate.net, so long as it contains all the required information, including:<ol>\n<li>The name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address of the complaining party.</li>\n<li>A description of the copyrighted work(s) or other intellectual property claimed to have been infringed and the country of claimed rights.</li>\n<li>A description of where the allegedly infringing material is located on ResearchGate, with information sufficient to permit us to locate the material.\nIn order for us to be able to accurately identify and remove content notified to be infringing, it is necessary to provide the specific URL for the actual file and not the URL of the publication page where the file is displayed, as the content displayed on a publication page can change.\nYou can identify the URL of a particular file by clicking on the downward-facing arrow at the top-right corner of a publication page, selecting \"Full-text sources,\" right clicking on the respective download button of the file and copying the link address.</li>\n<li>A statement that the complaining party \"has a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\"</li>\n<li>A statement that \"the information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\"</li>\n<li>An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other right that is allegedly infringed.</li>\n</ol>\n<i>Note: If you are asserting infringement of an intellectual property right other than copyright, please specify the intellectual property right at issue (for example, \"trademark\").</i>Upon receiving notice of a claimed infringement that complies with the above requirements, we will expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material and will notify the member who posted it.\nAt that time, we will also provide the member with an email address which may be used to contact the complaining party with any questions, or if they think a mistake has been made.Repeat infringer policyIn accordance with applicable law, we have a repeat infringer policy that provides for the disabling of a member's uploading rights or termination of their membership in appropriate circumstances.Counter notice requirementsResearchGate recognizes that sometimes content may be mistakenly identified by a rights owner as infringing their rights.\nIn the event such a mistake occurs, you should first contact the complaining party directly using the email address provided to you.\nResearchGate will allow you to re-upload the content upon receipt of an acknowledgement of the error from the complaining party.If the complaining party does not agree that their request for removal was in error, you may submit a counter notice using this Counter Notice Form.Alternatively, you can submit a written communication to ResearchGate\u2019s Designated Agent (contact details above).\nTo be effective, your counter notice must include substantially the following:<ul>\n<li>Your name, address and telephone number.</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location (URL) at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</li>\n<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.</li>\n<li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside the United States, for any judicial district in which ResearchGate may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the party who submitted the notification of claimed infringement or an agent of that party.</li>\n<li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>\n</ul>We will not be able to consider your counter notice unless you fill out the form in its entirety, and physically sign it.\nPlease make sure that the counter notice you send to ResearchGate is legible.\nif we cannot read your handwriting we will not be able to process it.Upon receiving the original of your fully completed counter notice, ResearchGate will provide the complaining party with a copy of your notice.\nWe will also inform them that we will allow you to replace the removed material after 10 business days, unless ResearchGate\u2019s Designated Agent receives notice from the complaining party that it has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on ResearchGate.\nIf the complaining party notifies us in writing that they no longer object to the material being made available, we will allow you to repost it.\nCompanyAbout usNewsCareersSupportHelp CenterBusiness

enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.These Terms are only available and binding in their English-language version.Additional Terms of Service

may be challenged if the arbitrator does so.\nOtherwise, the arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction.\n<strong>Neither you nor we shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity.</strong> Accordingly, you and we agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our arbitration.\nA court may sever any portion of Section 17 that it finds to be unenforceable, except for the prohibition on class, representative, and private attorney general arbitration.ExceptionsNotwithstanding the foregoing, disputes, claims,

arising after the 30th day.18.\nApplicable US lawThe U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) is the law that will be applied to determine whether Section 17 can be enforced and how it should be interpreted.Apart from that, if you are a United States resident, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by Californian law, except for its conflicts of laws principles.19.\nVenue for legal disputes not subject to arbitrationIf you are a United States resident, judicial proceedings that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 17 must be brought in state or federal court in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree to some other location.\nYou and ResearchGate both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco,
