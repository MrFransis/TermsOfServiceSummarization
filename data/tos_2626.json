very seriously.\nwe do not want IRCCloud to become a tool for ban evasion, and we're happy to work with network and channel operators to make sure this is the case.\n</p> How to ban IRCCloud users\n<p>\nThe <strong>ideal ban mask</strong> for banning a specific IRCCloud account is:\n<b>\n<code>*!*id12345@*.irccloud.com</code>\n</b>, where <code>12345</code> is the user's ID.\nNote that <b>\n<code>uid</code>\n</b> indicates a free account,\npaid accounts have the prefix <b>\n<code>sid</code>\n</b>.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each IRCCloud user is allocated a unique, static user ID which they cannot change.\n</li>\n<li>This ID is included in the username and is verified by IDENT, so it can be used to positively identify one user for banning.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The hostname that an IRCCloud account connects from can vary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the connection is made using IPv4, they may originate from a number of IPv4 connection pools.\nSee our networks FAQ for the full list.\n</li>\n<li>If the connection is made using IPv6, they will originate from their own IPv6 address.\n</li>\n<li>All of these addresses will have a reverse DNS entry pointing to a subdomain of irccloud.com.\n</li>\n</ul> When NOT to report abuse <p> In general we defer to network and channel staff in cases where a simple ban will suffice, or where it's more difficult to make a judgment call.\nThese include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A single abusive user who isn't evading bans and never comes back.\nA ban solves the problem.</li>\n<li>Someone\u2019s squatting your nick or channel.\nThis is what Nickserv/Chanserv etc.\nare for.\nIf you need to reclaim your nick or channel and haven't registered it, please appeal to network staff.\nThis isn't an area we get involved in unless widespread impersonation and abusive behaviour is taking place.</li>\n<li>Any situation where using the /ignore feature of your client would solve it.</li>\n</ul> How to report abuse or harassment\n<p>\nIf a user continues to use IRCCloud to evade bans, please let us know and we will take action.\nTo file a report, send the following details to <strong>abuse@irccloud.com</strong>:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All usernames, hosts and nicks used by the abuser </li>\n<li>IRC server and channel details where the abuse occured </li>\n<li>Time and date of incident (include your timezone!) </li>\n<li>Excerpt of relevant logs/conversations or other information\n</li>\n</ul>\nExample Report Subject: Abuse report for user 123456 This user was spamming in #mychannel on irc.freenode.net\nHere are logs from 10

records of your\ncommunications, to provide the service to you.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe process your payment information to bill you for the service, and we keep\nrecords of payments as required by law.\n(We do not store your payment\ninformation.\nthis is kept by our payment service providers.)\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you contact us (e.g.\nour support team, or via social media), we\u2019ll use\nyour information

you do not, you will\nnot be able to use service.\n</p> Recipients of personal data\n<p>\nWe rely on a number of third parties to help us provide the service.\nThis\nincludes payment processors and hosting providers.\n</p>\n<p>\nExcept for these, we will not reveal user data to a third party unless:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> We are compelled to by law, or </li>\n<li> We believe it is necessary to prevent death or serious physical harm to someone.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIf we believe a legal request to be too broad, we will seek to narrow it.\nWhere\nappropriate, we will notify users about a legal request for their data unless we\nare prevented from doing so by law.\n</p> Transfers of personal data outside the EEA\n<p>\nWe transfer your personal data to a number of providers in the USA.\nThese\ninclude providers of hosting services, payment processing services and various\nadministrative services.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe majority of these are reliant on the\nEuropean Commission\u2019s\nmodel&nbsp;contract&nbsp;clauses.\n</p>\n<p>\nPayPal, one of our payment services providers, is based in the EEA, but may\ntransfer personal data outside the EEA to provide its service.\nIt uses binding\ncorporate rules for transfers between PayPal-related companies.\nYou can find\nmore information\nhere.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information, please email team@irccloud.com.\n</p> Storage period\n<p>\nWe keep logs of your IRC communications until you delete your account with us,\nor a connection, or channel.\nThis means that, even if you stop using IRCCloud\nfor a while, when you next log in, it will be as if you never went away.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you delete your account, a connection, or channel, your logs are purged\nfrom our active data store within 7 days, and from all backups after a maximum\nof 60 days.\nYou can delete it any time\nfrom&nbsp;your settings on the web site.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe keep website analytics information for approximately a week.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe keep records of your payments indefinitely, to resolve disputes and for our\naccounting records.\n</p> Your rights\n<p>\nYou have the right to\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>request from us access to and rectification or erasure of your personal data;</li>\n<li>restriction of processing or to object to processing.\nand</li>\n<li>request data portability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIf you have any questions, please send an email to\nteam@irccloud.com.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe hope you will never need to use it, and we will deal promptly and effectively\nwith any complaints you might have, but you also have the right to lodge a\ncomplaint with a data protection supervisory authority, such as the Information\nCommissioner\u2019s Office.\n</p> Your account password\n<p>\nWe store your account password using a strong hash function designed for passwords (bcrypt).\nThis would make it very expensive for an attacker to recover your password if they gained access to the hashes.</p>\n<p>As a matter of good practice, we recommend that you use a strong, unique password for IRCCloud, and that\nyou don't reuse your IRCCloud password on other websites.\nWe recommend using a secure password manager such\nas LastPass or 1Password.\n</p> Other passwords and credentials\n<p>\nIf you choose to save server or Nickserv passwords and other on-connect commands,\nwe store these using reversable encryption with a per-user key.\nWe only decrypt these at the point of\ntransmission and never store or log them unencrypted.\n</p> OPERing, and sending passwords via IRCCloud\n<p>\nWe don't store commands you send to the server, such as /oper or Chanserv passwords.\nHowever, be aware that any passwords or credentials included in a response from the server will be stored\nin your backlog.\n</p>\n<p>\nSome IRC network policies prohibit OPERing up on hosted IRC clients, so check with your network administrators if you are unsure.\n</p> Payment Information\n<p>\nPayment information (full credit card details, etc), isn't stored on our servers.\nThey are held by the payment processing services we use: either PayPal or Stripe.\nWe only have access\nto the last 4 digits of your card number, and never see the CCV security code.\n</p> Web Security\n<p>\nAccess to IRCCloud, via the website or mobile apps, is always encrypted over HTTPS.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe also send HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers, and our domain is included in the preloaded\nHSTS lists in Chrome and Firefox.\nThis means your session can't be hijacked due to insecure wifi or coffee-shop/firesheep style exploits.\n</p>\n<p>Embedding media from external sites can cause your web browser to warn that this site is \u201cnot fully secure\u201d.\nYour IRCCloud session and data are <strong>always secure and private</strong>, but embedded media may load insecurely.\nAlso, be aware that embedding external media may result in your IP address being revealed to the external service, even for secure content.</p> IRC Network Security\n<p>\nWhile connections to IRCCloud are always encrypted, bear in mind that you can make insecure (non-SSL) connections to IRC networks.\n</p>\n<p>\nAdditionally, it may be difficult to ensure your conversations don't pass over insecure server-server or server-client connections once they've left our servers.\nUnless you trust your IRC network and are fully aware of these security risks, we recommend that you do not send sensitive information over IRC.\n</p> Chat Logs\n<p>\nAs part of the service, we log and archive all activity in channels you join and private messages.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe store these logs on a separate server cluster to the rest of the system, with no direct references to email addresses and personal data stored alongside them.\n</p>\n<p>\nYour logs are not encrypted, because we send them back to you as plaintext, and we need to be able to index them for searching.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur staff will ask your permission if they need to access your logs, typically to assist with technical support.\nWe may access your account and view your history without asking your permission when investigating abuse or misuse of the service, in accordance with our abuse policy.\n</p>\n<p>Archived versions of our terms and policies are available at /legal-archives</p> ",
