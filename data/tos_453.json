transferred to you upon completion of the purchase as described in paragraph 4.3 above;</li>\n<br>\n<li>any risk of loss of Virtual Money that you receive from us without making a purchase is transferred to you at the time the Virtual Money is successfully credited to your account on our servers.\nand</li>\n<br>\n<li>any risk of loss of other data associated with your Game play (including,

Money, Virtual Goods and/or Subscriptions without any liability to you at any time, but if you have an active Subscription such changes will only take effect following the end of the then-current Subscription period, at which date your Subscription will automatically terminate.</p>\n<p>4.8 We may revise the pricing for Virtual Goods, Virtual Money and/or Subscriptions offered through the

paragraph 21 apply to all Disputes between you and King and/or King\u2019s parents, subsidiaries and Affiliates relating to the Games and Services.\nParagraph 21 also applies to any Dispute between you and any King Affiliates, each of which is an intended third-party beneficiary of paragraph 21.\nFor the purposes of paragraph 21, \u201cAffiliate\u201d shall mean any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with King, where \u2018control\u2019 means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of such entity\u2019s capital or equivalent voting rights and \u201cDispute\u201d shall include any dispute, claim, controversy or action between you and King (or any King Affiliates) arising out of or relating to this agreement, the Services, or any other transaction involving you and King, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis.</p>\n<p>21.2 Initial Dispute Resolution: If you have any concerns or queries regarding our Services, our customer support team can be reached through our King Community portal (http://community.king.com).\nMost concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers' satisfaction.\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>\n<p>21.3 Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to the paragraph 21.2, then You and King agree that all Disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration according to this agreement.\nARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED.\nUnder this agreement, binding arbitration shall be administered by JAMS, a nationally recognized arbitration authority, under its procedures then in effect for consumer related disputes, but excluding any rules that permit joinder or class actions in arbitration (for more detail on procedure, see paragraph 21.5 below).\nYou and King understand and agree that (a) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a71, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this paragraph 21, (b) this agreement memorialises a transaction in interstate commerce, and (c) this paragraph 21 shall survive termination of this agreement.</p>\n<p>21.4 Arbitration Procedure: If you or King commences arbitration, the arbitration shall be governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect when the arbitration is filed, excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class or representative basis (the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d), available at http://www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267, and under the rules set forth in this agreement.\nAll Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and must follow applicable law.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this agreement is void or voidable.\nNotwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is excluded from arbitration under paragraph 21.6.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nIn some instances, the costs of arbitration can exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nYou may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone.\nArbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence, or in Los Angeles, California, at your option.\nInstructions for initiating an arbitration are available at the JAMS website and toll-free number referenced above.</p>\n<p>21.5 Class Action Waiver: The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.\nYOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR THE PRIVACY POLICY ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class action
