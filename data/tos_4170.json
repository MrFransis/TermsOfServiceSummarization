which it was collected, or as required or permitted by applicable laws.</p>\n<p>We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by which the data can be associated with you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves the purpose for which the personal data was collected, and is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.</p>\n<p>We use services outside of Singapore that include the storage on servers and data processed by natural persons outside of Singapore in the normal course of providing goods and services to you.\nWe will obtain your consent for the transfer to be made and we will take steps to ensure that your personal data continues to receive a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that provided
