Advertising Revenue Share Program <strong>Advertising Revenue Share Program</strong>\n<strong>General Info:</strong>\nEmpireStreaming\u2019s ad-insertion system operates using metadata triggers to trigger and specify the length of the ad break.\nWe provide pre-made 30, 60, 90, and 120 second trigger files upon service sign-up.\nOr, you can create your own trigger files by putting these tags in the \u201cartist\u201d or \u201ctitle\u201d field using a metadata tag editor:<br>\n30 Second Trigger \u2013 ADWTAG_30000<br>\n60 Second Trigger \u2013 ADWTAG_60000<br>\n90 Second Triggers \u2013 ADWTAG_90000<br>\n120 Second Trigger \u2013 ADWTAG_122000<br>\n<p>\n<br>\nBroadcasters are required to run 4 minutes worth of ad-breaks per hour for streams which are not using audio pre-rolls, or 3 minutes and 30 seconds (3:30) worth of ad-breaks per hour for streams which are using audio pre-rolls.</p>\n<p>\nA maximum of two (2) minutes is allowed pre ad break, with a separation of at least 15 minutes in-between each ad break.</p>\n<p>\nYou may not run two trigger files back to back.\nOur system will not detect the 2nd trigger and therefore not inject any ads.</p>\n<p>\nBroadcasters must point all listeners to the stream server that EmpireStreaming has provided.\nCredit will not be given for listeners who are listening through a stream not provided by EmpireStreaming.\nWe highly suggest the use of PLS and ASX files to give to directories such as iTunes, TuneIn, etc.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>How does it work?</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Our ad-insertion servers look for the tags enclosed in the metadata of the trigger files, which specifies the length of the ad break.</p>\n<p>\nOnce our system sees the metadata, it will overlay our network spots over the top of your stream for the specified ad break length</p>\n<p>\nOnce the ad break finishes, it will go back to your station\u2019s stream.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Ad-insertion Setup:</strong>\n<p>\n</p> Once you are encoding and pointing your listeners to the stream server that we have provided you, and once we have verified that you are correctly running the ad-break trigger files, we will set up your stream(s) on our ad-insertion platform.\nThis can take up to 7 days from the point that you begin running the trigger files.\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Reports and Payments:</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWithin 40-50 days following the end of each broadcast month, EmpireStreaming will provide a revenue/impressions report showing ad-insertion revenue for the specified month.</p>\n<p>\nAd impressions are calculated based on a CPM (cost per 1000 impressions).</p>\n<p>\nBroadcasters are required to submit an invoice to EmpireStreaming for the amount specified in the revenue/impressions report within 3 months of receiving the report.\nRevenue payments will not be sent unless an invoice is received by EmpireStreaming.</p>\n<p>\nAd revenue will be considered abandoned if broadcaster does not submit an invoice within 3 months of receiving the report.\nIt is the broadcaster\u2019s responsibility to reach out if a revenue report is not received.</p>\n<p>\nUnited States based broadcasters MUST have a valid form W9 on file with EmpireStreaming before any payments can be released.\nWithout a valid W9, any proceeds will be considered abandoned and future payments will not be paid out.\nBroadcaster may submit proper form W9 and be paid, but only within a 3 month history of ad payments.\nExample: Broadcaster submits W9 in September, only the months of June, July, and August will be added as account payments.</p>\n<p>\nEmpireStreaming will distribute ad-revenue payments within 100-140 days following the end of corresponding month.\nOnly those Broadcasters whose EmpireStreaming accounts are current (i.e., active Advertising Supported Package and not delinquent) are eligible to receive payment from EmpireStreaming.</p>\n<p>\nEmpireStreaming requires a minimum of $100 in accumulated revenues for payment via check.\nThere is no minimum revenue requirement for payment via PayPal.</p>\n<p>\nEmpireStreaming has the right to modify the terms of the \u201cAdvertising Revenue Share Program\u201d at any time.</p>\n<p>\nFor the latest terms and conditions about EmpireStreaming\u2019s \u201cAdvertising Revenue Share Program\u201d \u2013 including information about how to receive your payment from EmpireStreaming \u2013 please refer to EmpireStreaming \u201cAdvertising Revenue Share Program\u201d details page, which is available at:
