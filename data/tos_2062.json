Rights.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nThis provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute that may arise between you and us.\nEffectively, then, \u201cdispute\u201d is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis provision provides that all disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.\nWe prefer this because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation.\nTo be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney\u2019s fees).\nYOU AND CALENDLY AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.\n</p>\n<p>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</p>\n<p>\nFor all disputes, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute which is first done by emailing us at support@calendly.com the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.\nIf we do not resolve the dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your dispute in arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>Arbitration Procedures</p>\n<p>\nIf this provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nJAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.\nThe arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.\nThis provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.\nUnder no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.\nBecause this Website and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the arbitrability of all disputes.\nHowever, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.\nYou or we may initiate arbitration in either Georgia or the federal judicial district where you are located.\n</p>\n<p>Class Action Waiver</p>\n<p>\nExcept as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Calendly specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>Other</p>\n<p>\nYou understand and agree that by accepting this provision in these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.\nIf any clause within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect.\nIf the Class Action Waiver clause is found

Personal Information to a third-party for a business purpose.\nWhen we disclose Personal Information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that Personal Information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing your contract.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe disclose your Personal Information for a business purpose to the following categories of third parties:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service Providers.</li>\n<li>Third parties to whom you or your agents authorize us to disclose your Personal Information in connection with the

Specific Information and Data Portability Rights\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>\nYou have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The categories of Personal Information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>The categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal

Deletion Request Rights\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>\nYou have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we have collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.\nAll deletion requests will be managed in accordance with Calendly Deletion Procedures.\nDeletion requests should be sent to support@calendly.com.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will delete (and direct our Service Providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nComplete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.\n</li>\n<li>\nDetect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.\n</li>\n<li>\nDebug software to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.\n</li>\n<li>\nComply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n</li>\n<li>\nEnable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on

Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>\nTo exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by reaching out to support@calendly.com.\n</p>\n<p>\nOnly you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information.\nYou may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.\nYou may only make a verifiable California Resident request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.\n</p>\n<p>The request must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nProvide sufficiently detailed information to allow Calendly to reasonably verify that you are the person to whom the requested Personal Information pertains or their authorized representative.\n</li>\n<li>\nInclude sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\n</li>\n<li>\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.\n</li>\n<li>\nMaking a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\n</li>\n<li>\nCalendly will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.\n</li>\n</ul> Response Timing and Format\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>\nWe will attempt to respond to California Resident requests in as timely a fashion as possible.\nIn the event of delays over 60 days, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\nIf you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.\nAny disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable receipt of a California Resident\u2019s request.\nThe response we provide will explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before fulfilling your request.\n</p> Non-Discrimination\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>\nIn accordance with the CCPA\u2019s requirements, we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\n</p> Changes to Our
