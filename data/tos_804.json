your request to pay any additional arbitration costs.\nIf an arbitrator issues an award in our favor, you will not be required to reimburse us for any fees we have previously paid to the administrator

will consider any reasonable written request by you for us to bear the cost.</p>\n<p>(f) YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and we agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, except that claims brought by joint applicants or co-borrowers relating to the same loan transaction shall be consolidated.\nThe arbitrator shall have no power to arbitrate any Claims on a class action basis or Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other borrowers, or other persons similarly situated.\nThe validity and effect of this paragraph (f) shall be determined exclusively by a court, and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.</p>\n<p>(g) If any portion of this Arbitration Section is deemed invalid or unenforceable for
