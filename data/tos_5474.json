<p>When you look at websites, text, graphics, videos, and other computer data moves from a web server (which stores the website you're looking at and \"serves\" it up to you) to your web browser (the program, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Google Chrome, or whatever you use to surf the Web).\nThere is no easy way for a web browser to remember things about you as you move from page to page, which makes life difficult if you want to do something like putting a product in a shopping cart (trolley), select a particular size of text for the pages you're looking at, sign in to a website for a personalized experience, and so on.</p>\n<p>That's where cookies come in.\nCookies are small files that websites can store on your computer to help them remember things about you.\nSome cookies (known as session cookies) stay on your computer only for very short periods of time (typically, until you close your browser).\nothers, known as persistent cookies, may stay there for years.\nSome cookies, known as first-party cookies, are set by the websites you visit.\nothers are set by services that those websites rely on (for example, advertisements, statistical tracking programs, social networking widgets and so on)\u2014and they're known as third-party cookies.\nCookies like this can be used to track a web user's progress as they move from one website to another, although they generally do so anonymously (they don't usually contain personally identifiable information).\nNevertheless, the use of cookies does raise understandable concerns about privacy.\nIf you are worried about this, you can set up your web browser to accept or reject certain kinds of cookies and you can inspect or delete the cookies it contains at any time.\nI explain how to do this below.</p> How does explainthatstuff.com use cookies? <p>This website uses cookies for three things: to improve your experience of the site, to serve relevant personalized advertising, and for social media.\nVery occasionally, it uses\nanalytics cookies for short-lived tests.</p> Strictly necessary, technical cookies <p>Explainthatstuff.com uses temporary browser storage to record the fact that you have seen a cookie warning and consented to it by clicking \"OK.\" This doesn't contain or record any personally identifying information.\nThis website doesn't use any other \"persistent\" (long-lasting) cookies and doesn't use any cookies to track you or collect personal information about you.</p> Advertising cookies <p>\n<b>This site uses cookies to serve personalized advertising</b>.</p>\n<p>Although our own server does not set persistent cookies (other than for cookie consent), please be aware\nthat <b>some persistent third-party cookies are set when you visit our website</b>.\nOur site runs advertisements on most pages.\nit is a completely free website and if it didn't run advertising, it would simply not exist: the cost of web hosting for a site this big is now around \u00a3800/US$1000 a year.\nThe advertising partners I work with use what are known as persistent, third-party cookies to help them serve up relevant, targeted advertisements that they believe may match your interests, and they may share them with their own partner companies.\n(Although you might raise an eyebrow at this use of cookies, perhaps it is better that advertisers show you things you might find interesting or useful than completely random advertisements?) Explainthatstuff.com has no control over these third-party cookies.\nI do not see or have access to any information they may store or collect.\nThey pass directly between your computer and the servers run by my advertisers.</p>\n<p>At the moment, I run all the advertisements on this site through Google, which publishes a detailed explanation of how it uses information from sites or apps that use its services (including this website).</p>\n<p>Briefly, third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads to you based on your prior visits to our website.\nGoogle's main advertising cookie is called DoubleClick.\nGoogle's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve personalized ads to you based on your visit to our site and/or other sites you have previously visited on the Internet.\nYou may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting\nGoogle's Ads Settings page.\nIf you want to permanently opt-out of the DoubleClick cookie, you can install a\nbrowser plugin\non your browser, which works on Firefox, Chrome, and Internet Explorer,\nbut you will need to do that for each computer and web browser that you use\n(if you use more than one).\nYou can learn more about how Google safeguards your privacy by visiting the Google Privacy Policy website.</p>\n<p>The cookies of other third-party vendors or other ad networks may also be used to serve ads on our site\nas part of Google's wider advertising network, and you can opt out of these cookies too by visiting www.youronlinechoices.com (Europe)\nor youradchoices.com.</p> Analytics cookies\n<p>\nMost websites routinely use what are called analytics cookies to measure what visitors are\ndoing\u2014which pages they're looking at, which pages are most popular, how long people spend on the site, how quickly they leave certain pages, and even which bits of a page they're looking at most.\nThe analytics code they use is typically supplied by Google or a rival company and the data it gathers is shared with those companies.\nAnalytics is running all the time on these sites, tracking everything you do.\nWho knows what happens to it after that?</p>\n<p>\nWe deliberately don't do this: we do not run analytics code all the time.\nThere is no good\nreason for doing it.\nOccasionally, we enable analytics to test a new feature on our site for a few days.\nWhere possible, instead of using one of the third-party analytics options, we run Open Web Analytics on our own server, we don't share the data we gather with anyone else, and we delete whatever data is gathered at the end\nof the test.\nOWA is inherently more \"privacy-friendly.\" The data we look at is aggregated (lots of people's data is merged together) and doesn't reveal anything to us about what you, as an individual, are doing.\nOnce our tests are complete, we switch off the analytics code and delete the data.\n</p> Social media cookies\n<p>\n<b>This site does <u>not</u> use privacy-invasive social media sharing buttons or social media cookies</b>\u2014 and our pages contain no other social media tracking code of any kind.\nIn other words, we do not allow sites like Twitter and Facebook to track you with their social media cookies.\nThe social-sharing icons you'll see on our pages, which look like this...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>...are simple, ordinary web links that don't track or trace you in any way.\nAlthough they look just like the official buttons, they're just images with simple HTML links out to Facebook,\nWhatsApp, and Twitter.\nthey don't use any cookies.</p> UK Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 <p>\nEuropean Law requires that I inform European citizens of how this website uses cookies.\nI have carefully reviewed my legal obligations under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (revised May 2011), in line with guidance from the UK Information Commissioner's Office.\nIt's for this reason that explainthatstuff.com informs you that it is using cookies when you first enter it.</p> EU General Data Protection Regulations <p>As explained above, this website does not collect or store any personal information about you.\nIt fully informs you about cookie use and allows you to consent to the use of cookies or opt-out of cookie use\njust as easily at any time.\nI have reviewed my legal obligations and believe the site is compliant with the EU GDPR, which is effective from May 25, 2018.</p> California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) <p>As explained above, explainthatstuff.com does not collect, store, sell, or share any personal information about you\nand has no plans to do so in the future.\nHowever, in line with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA),\nyou may still send us a \"Do Not Sell My Personal Information\" request if you wish.</p> Children's Online Privacy Protection Act <p>As explained above, this site collects and stores no personal information from anyone\u2014and that includes children under the age of 13.\nI believe it is therefore fully compliant with the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p> Email addresses <p>I value feedback from readers <b>very highly</b>: I'm trying to improve this site all the time and your thoughts and suggestions are invaluable.\nIf you send feedback or comments, I keep them and act on them, if that's appropriate.\nI give you the option of sending feedback anonymously, though (to prevent abuse), your IP address and computer hostname are sent at the same time, along with basic details of which browser, operating system, and so on that you're using (that helps me if you've commented about formatting problems, mobile-device usability, or things like that).\nIf you do choose to send your email address, I may use it to send you a reply.\nI don't use it for any other purpose, I don't record it anywhere, and I don't retain it.\nIf I send you a reply, I delete that promptly too, so there is no record of your email address anywhere on this web server or email server.\nWhen I store your feedback, I delete your name, email address, IP address, and host name.\nonly your comments and suggestions are stored.</p> Opting out <p>Explainthatstuff.com does not offer a way for you to opt-out of having your information collected or a way to remove your personal information from my records, because I don't collect any information about you.</p> How can you control your privacy? <p>Remember: you are in control: you can restrict the information that websites collect about you very easily at any time.</p>\n<p>\nIf you're concerned about cookies, you can change the options in your Web browser to restrict how websites can use them.\nYou can switch off certain cookies, instruct your browser to keep them only for certain periods, or delete cookies altogether.\nYou can set the level of privacy controls you want by looking under Privacy in your browser's options, preferences, or settings.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that if you switch off cookies altogether, you might prevent some parts of some websites (such as shopping carts and personal preferences) from working properly or you might find yourself logged out of a website and unable to access it properly.\nOne solution is to enable cookies only for those websites you know and trust (favorite shopping sites) and disable them for all other sites.\nGenerally, if you don't log in to websites and you don't want to buy things or set website preferences, it is safe to switch off cookies altogether.\nif any websites do need to use them, they will usually display a message suggesting you switch them back on.\nSwitching off third-party cookies usually causes no problems.</p>\n<p>You could also try switching to a browser like Firefox, which blocks third-party tracking, or installing a browser add-on like\nPrivacy Badger.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Don't track, private browsing, and incognito <p>Some modern Web browsers have other ways of improving your privacy.\nFor example, if you look under \"Privacy\" in newer versions of Firefox, you'll find a simple tick-box option \"Tell websites I do not want to be tracked.\" Sounds great! Unfortunately, \"do not track\" is an empty promise: it's entirely voluntary (and it doesn't stop tracking anyway), so it's much less effective than blocking or deleting cookies.\nMost of the common browsers also have a \"private browsing\" or \"incognito\" mode that stops any data from being collected as you move from page to page, but you probably won't be able to sign into websites if you use this option all the time.\nAnd you won't be completely incognito: your IP address will still be visible to and logged by any sites you visit.</p>\n<p>Photo: You'll find the \"Don't Track\" option in Firefox under the Privacy options.\nYou can also change the \"History\" setting underneath so Firefox deletes all records of your current session when you exit your browser.</p> Site statistics and server logs <p>As discussed up above, unlike most other websites, this one doesn't obsessively run analytics software to track visitors.\noccasionally we run Open Web Analytics for a day or two to diagnose technical problems but, unlike most websites, we don't have it switched on the whole time gathering data for no good reason or tracking everything you do.\nLike almost every other server, this site's (Apache) server logs the IP address of visitors and the pages they look at.\nWe run a general statistical package called AWStats to process the logs and show up daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly patterns and trends.\nThis kind of server logging and aggregated analysis doesn't record any personal information about you or how you use this site: it simply shows general patterns about how many visitors the site has, which pages they look at, and so on.</p> How can you find out more about privacy issues? <p>These sites may help you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Ad Choices: Includes a simple way to opt out of online behavioral advertising.</li>\n<li>The Network Advertising Initiative: Makes it easy to see which advertisers have stored cookies on your company and how you can opt out of behavioral advertising.</li>\n<li>Your Online Choices: A simple guide to how and why advertisers use cookies and how you can control your privacy online.\nWritten mainly for European users.</li>\n<li>How Cookies Work: From Howstuffworks.</li>\n<li>HTTP cookies: Wikipedia has a fairly lengthy explanation of the issue and links to further information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a more general look at privacy issues, you might like to look at the\nElectronic Frontier Foundation: Privacy page.\nYou might also find Simson Garfinkel's book\nDatabase Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century\ninteresting.\nthough it's a little dated on specifics now, the basic issues haven't changed.</p> Acknowledgements\n<p>\nThe pop-up cookie-consent warning script on this website was supplied by Silktide, and slightly modified by me on July 29, 2015 so it serves faster from my own server.\nIt's released under the GNU General Public License Version 3 as published by the Free Software Foundation.</p> Let me know <p>I hope this answers any concerns you may have about privacy and reassures you that I take the issue seriously.\nIf you have any further queries, please don't hesitate to contact me using the email form.</p>\n<p>Please do NOT copy our articles onto blogs and other websites</p>\n<p>Articles from this website are registered at the US Copyright Office.\nCopying or otherwise using registered works without permission, removing this or other copyright notices, and/or infringing related rights could make you liable to severe civil or criminal penalties.</p>\n<p>Text copyright \u00a9 Chris Woodford 2006, 2018.\nAll rights reserved.\nFull copyright notice and terms of use.</p> Follow us\n<ul>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n</ul> More to explore on our website...\n<ul>\n<li>Communications</li>\n<li>Computers</li>\n<li>Electricity &amp.\nelectronics</li>\n<li>Energy</li>\n<li>Engineering</li>\n<li>Environment</li>\n<br>\n<li>Gadgets</li>\n<li>Home life</li>\n<li>Materials</li>\n<li>Science</li>\n<li>Tools &amp.\ninstruments</li>\n<li>Transportation</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Home</li>\n<li>A-Z index</li>\n<li>Send feedback</li>\n<li>Random article</li>\n<li>Timeline</li>\n<li>Teaching guide</li>\n<li>About us</li>\n<li>Privacy &amp.\ncookies</li>\n</ul> \u2191 Back to top ", "created_at": "2021-11-03 20:16:10.582144", "updated_at": "2021-11-03 19:16:56.248685"}], "points": [], "urls": ["explainthatstuff.com"]}}
