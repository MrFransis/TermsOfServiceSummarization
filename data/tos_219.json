name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your Instagram account, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek.\nAny Notice of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to Facebook, Inc., ATTN: Instagram Arbitration Filing, 1601 Willow Rd.\nMenlo Park, CA 94025.\nBefore we commence arbitration, we will send you a Notice of Dispute to the email address you use with your Instagram account, or other appropriate means.\nIf we are unable to resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence arbitration.</li>\n<li>We will pay all arbitration filing fees, administration and hearing costs, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration we bring or if your claims seek less than $75,000 and you timely provided us with a Notice of Dispute.\nFor all other claims, the costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules, including rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</li>\n<li>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County.\nYou also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.</li>\n<li>The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Unsolicited Material.</b>\n<blockquote> We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for

Products.Learn more about what information is public and how to control your visibility on Facebook and Instagram.<b>Content others share or reshare about you</b>You should consider who you choose to share with, because people who can see your activity on our Products can choose to share it with others on and off our Products, including people and businesses outside the audience you shared with.\nFor example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Facebook Spaces.\nAlso, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later.People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose.\nFor example, people can share a photo of you in a Story, mention or tag you at a location in a post, or share information about you in their posts or messages.\nIf you are uncomfortable with what others have shared about you on our Products, you can learn how to report the content.<b>Information about your active status or presence on our Products.</b>People in your networks can see signals telling them whether you are active on our Products, including whether you are currently active on Instagram, Messenger or Facebook, or when you last used our Products.<b>Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.</b>When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share.\nFor example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook.\nAlso, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them.\nApps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them.\nBut apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).\nInformation collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e.\nwhere we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.<i>Note: We are in the process of restricting developers\u2019 data access even further to help prevent abuse.\nFor example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address.\nRequesting any other data will require our approval.</i>\n<b>New owner.</b>If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner.</blockquote>\n<br>\n<b>Sharing with Third-Party Partners</b>\n<blockquote>We work with third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people around the world.\nWe don't sell any of your information to anyone, and we never will.\nWe also impose strict restrictions on how our partners can use and disclose the data we provide.\nHere are the types of third parties we share information with:<b>Partners who use our analytics services.</b>We provide aggregated statistics and insights that help people and businesses understand how people are engaging with their posts, listings, Pages, videos and other content on and off the Facebook Products.\nFor example, Page admins and Instagram business profiles receive information about the number of people or accounts who viewed, reacted to, or commented on their posts, as well as aggregate demographic and other information that helps them understand interactions with their Page or account.<b>Advertisers.</b>We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission.\nFor example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience.\nWe also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.<b>Measurement partners.</b>We share information about you with companies that aggregate it to provide analytics and measurement reports to our partners.<b>Partners offering goods and services in our Products.</b>When you subscribe to receive premium content, or buy something from a seller in our Products, the content creator or seller can receive your public information and other information you share with them, as well as the information needed to complete the transaction, including shipping and contact details.<b>Vendors and service providers.</b>We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our Products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys.<b>Researchers and academics.</b>We also provide information and content to research partners and academics to conduct research that advances scholarship and innovation that support our business or mission, and enhances discovery and innovation on topics of general social welfare, technological advancement, public interest, health and well-being.<b>Law enforcement or legal requests.</b>We share information with law enforcement or in response to legal requests in the circumstances outlined below.Learn more about how you can control the information about you that you or others share with third-party partners in the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.<br>\n<br>\n</blockquote>\n<b>IV.\nHow do the Facebook Companies work together?</b>Facebook and Instagram share infrastructure, systems and technology with other Facebook Companies (which include WhatsApp and Oculus) to provide an innovative, relevant, consistent and safe experience across all Facebook Company Products you use.\nWe also process information about you across the Facebook Companies for these purposes, as permitted by applicable law and in accordance with their terms and policies.\nFor example, we process information from WhatsApp about accounts sending spam on its service so we can take appropriate action against those accounts on Facebook, Instagram or Messenger.\nWe also work to understand how people use and interact with Facebook Company Products, such as understanding the number of unique users on different Facebook Company Products.<br>\n<br>\n<b>V.\nHow can I manage or delete information about me?</b>We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data.\nLearn more in your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Facebook Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first.\nThis is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs.\nFor example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months.\nIf you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated.\nLearn more about deletion of content you have shared and cookie data obtained through social plugins.When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later.\nInformation that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted.\nIf you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead.\nTo delete your account at any time, please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.<br>\n<br>\n<b>VI.\nHow do we respond to legal requests or prevent harm?</b> We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others: <ul>\n<li>In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so.\nThis may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.</li>\n<li>When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity.\nto protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries.\nor to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.\nFor example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.</li>\n</ul> Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Facebook) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.\nWe also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>VII.\nHow do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?</b> We share information globally, both internally within the Facebook Companies, and externally with our partners and with those you connect and share with around the world in accordance with this policy.\nYour information may, for example, be transferred or transmitted to, or stored and processed in the United States or other countries outside of where you live for the purposes as described in this policy.\nThese data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the Facebook Terms and Instagram Terms and to globally operate and provide our Products to you.\nWe utilize standard contract clauses, rely on the European Commission's adequacy decisions about certain countries, as applicable, and obtain your consent for these data transfers to the United States and other countries.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>VIII.\nHow will we notify you of changes to this policy?</b>We'll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>IX.\nHow to contact Facebook with questions</b> You can learn more about how privacy works on Facebook and on Instagram.\nIf you have questions about this policy, you can contact us as described below.\nWe may resolve disputes you have with us in connection with our

specific non-disclosure period in a court order and where we have a good faith belief that exceptional circumstances no longer exist, and we are not otherwise prohibited by law from doing so.\nLaw enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited.\nIf

real-world harm, including through our policies prohibiting coordination of harm, sale of medical masks and related goods, hate speech, bullying and harassment and misinformation that contributes to the risk of imminent violence or physical harm.\nAs the situation evolves, we continue to look at content on the platform, assess speech trends, and engage with experts, and will provide additional policy guidance when appropriate to keep the members of our community safe during this crisis.\n</i>\n</p>The Short<p>We want Instagram to continue to be an authentic and safe place for inspiration and expression.\nHelp us foster this community.\nPost only your own photos and videos and always follow the law.\nRespect everyone on Instagram, don\u2019t spam people or post nudity.</p>The Long<p>Instagram is a reflection of our diverse community of cultures, ages, and beliefs.\nWe\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about the different points of view that create a safe and open environment for everyone.</p>\n<p>We created the Community Guidelines so you can help us foster and protect this amazing community.\nBy using Instagram, you agree to these guidelines and our Terms of Use.\nWe\u2019re committed to these guidelines and we hope you are too.\nOverstepping these boundaries may result in deleted content, disabled accounts, or other restrictions.</p>\n<p>In some cases, we allow content for public awareness which would otherwise go against our Community Guidelines \u2013 if it is newsworthy and in the public interest.\nWe do this only after weighing the public interest value against the risk of harm and we look to international human rights standards to make these judgments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share only photos and videos that you\u2019ve taken or have the right to share.<p>As always, you own the content you post on Instagram.\nRemember to post authentic content, and don\u2019t post anything you\u2019ve copied or collected from the Internet that you don\u2019t have the right to post.\nLearn more about intellectual property rights.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Post photos and videos that are appropriate for a diverse audience.<p>We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don\u2019t allow nudity on Instagram.\nThis includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks.\nIt also includes some photos of female nipples, but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed.\nNudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is OK, too.</p>\n<p>People like to share photos or videos of their children.\nFor safety reasons, there are times when we may remove images that show nude or partially-nude children.\nEven when this content is shared with good intentions, it could be used by others in unanticipated ways.\nYou can learn more on our Tips for Parents page.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Foster meaningful and genuine interactions.<p>Help us stay spam-free by not artificially collecting likes, followers, or shares, posting repetitive comments or content, or repeatedly contacting people for commercial purposes without their consent.\nDon\u2019t offer money or giveaways of money in exchange for likes, followers, comments or other engagement.\nDon\u2019t post content that engages in, promotes, encourages, facilitates, or admits to the offering, solicitation or trade of fake and misleading user reviews or ratings.</p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to use your real name on Instagram, but we do require Instagram users to provide us with accurate and up to date information.\nDon't impersonate others and don't create accounts for the purpose of violating our guidelines or misleading others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Follow the law.<p>Instagram is not a place to support or praise terrorism, organized crime, or hate groups.\nOffering sexual services, buying or selling firearms, alcohol, and tobacco products between private individuals, and buying or selling illegal or prescription drugs (even if legal in your region) are also not allowed.\nInstagram also prohibits the sale of live animals between private individuals, though brick-and-mortar stores may offer these sales.\nNo one may coordinate poaching or selling of endangered species or their parts.</p>\n<p>Remember to always follow the law when offering to sell or buy other regulated goods.\nAccounts promoting online gambling, online real money games of skill or online lotteries must get our prior written permission before using any of our products.</p>\n<p>We have zero tolerance when it comes to sharing sexual content involving minors or threatening to post intimate images of others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Respect other members of the Instagram community.<p>We want to foster a positive, diverse community.\nWe remove content that contains credible threats or hate speech, content that targets private individuals to degrade or shame them, personal information meant to blackmail or harass someone, and repeated unwanted messages.\nWe do generally allow stronger conversation around people who are featured in the news or have a large public audience due to their profession or chosen activities.\n</p>\n<p>It's never OK to encourage violence or attack anyone based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, disabilities, or diseases.\nWhen hate speech is being shared to challenge it or to raise awareness, we may allow it.\nIn those instances, we ask that you express your intent clearly.</p>\n<p>Serious threats of harm to public and personal safety aren't allowed.\nThis includes specific threats of physical harm as well as threats of theft, vandalism, and other financial harm.\nWe carefully review reports of threats and consider many things when determining whether a threat is credible.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Maintain our supportive environment by not glorifying self-injury.<p>The Instagram community cares for each other, and is often a place where people facing difficult issues such as eating disorders, cutting, or other kinds of self-injury come together to create awareness or find support.\nWe try to do our part by providing education in the app and adding information in the Help Center so people can get the help they need.</p>\n<p>Encouraging or urging people to embrace self-injury is counter to this environment of support, and we\u2019ll remove it or disable accounts if it\u2019s reported to us.\nWe may also remove content identifying victims or survivors of self-injury if the content targets them for attack or humor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Be thoughtful when posting newsworthy events.<p>We understand that many people use Instagram to share important and newsworthy events.\nSome of these issues can involve graphic images.\nBecause so many different people and age groups use Instagram, we may remove videos of intense, graphic violence to make sure Instagram stays appropriate for everyone.</p>\n<p>We understand that people often share this kind of content to condemn, raise awareness or educate.\nIf you do share content for these reasons, we encourage you to caption your photo with a warning about graphic violence.\nSharing graphic images for sadistic pleasure or to glorify violence is never allowed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>Help us keep the community strong:<ul>\n<li>Each of us is an important part of the Instagram community.\nIf you see something that you think may violate our guidelines, please help us by using our built-in reporting option.\nWe have a global team that reviews these reports and works as quickly as possible to remove content that doesn\u2019t meet our guidelines.\nEven if you or someone you know doesn\u2019t have an Instagram account, you can still file a report.\nWhen you complete the report, try to provide as much information as possible, such as links, usernames, and descriptions of the content, so we can find and review it quickly.\nWe may remove entire posts if either the imagery or associated captions violate our guidelines.\n</li>\n<li>You may find content you don\u2019t like, but doesn\u2019t violate the Community Guidelines.\nIf that happens, you can unfollow or block the person who posted it.\nIf there's something you don't like in a comment on one of your posts, you can delete that comment.</li>\n<li>Many disputes and misunderstandings can be resolved directly between members of the community.\nIf one of your photos or videos was posted by someone else, you could try commenting on the post and asking the person to take it down.\nIf that
