addresses.\nOr, if you search Nextdoor for a particular product, we might show you advertisements for providers of that product or related or similar products.\nOur third party advertising partners

Europe, this section applies to you.\nIf you live in Australia or Canada, you may have some of the following rights under applicable law.</p>\n<p>11.2.1.&nbsp;<strong>On what legal basis do you

necessary for compliance with applicable tax laws.</p>\n<p>\u25cf&nbsp;<strong>Vital Interests</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Nextdoor might process your information in certain circumstances when it is necessary

your&nbsp;email account settings&nbsp;or, if you do not have an account, by&nbsp;contacting us.</p>\n<p>11.2.6.&nbsp;<strong>Revoke consent.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Where consent is required for processing under applicable law, you may have the right to withdraw your consent to the processing of your information at any time.\nIf you withdraw your consent to the use of your information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, you may not have access to all (or any) of our Services and we might not be able to provide you all (or any) of the Services under this Privacy Policy and our&nbsp;Member Agreement.\nIn certain cases, we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn consent if we have a legal basis to do so, or if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.</p>\n<p>11.2.7.&nbsp;<strong>Complain.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have a UK or EU Member account and wish to raise a concern about our use of your information

transferred.\nTo request a copy of the clauses, please email us at&nbsp;dpo@nextdoor.com.</p>\n<p>By continuing to use Nextdoor, you understand that we may transfer and store your data outside your
