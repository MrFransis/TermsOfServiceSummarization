You may create your Student Account because you are a student at a Handshake University Partner (\u201cUniversity Partner\u201d).\nUniversity Partners use Handshake as a service provider to manage their internal and external career center functions, such as scheduling meetings with students, arranging events, and passing resumes to interested employers.\nWhen University Partners sign up for Handshake, they send us personal information about their students so that Handshake can provide these services.\n</p>\n<p> Your University will send you an email with information about how to enable your Student Account.\nAfter you do so, and we confirm your association with our University Partner, we pre-populate some areas of your profile with information your University has provided.\nWe encourage you to review this information for accuracy and completeness.\nSome of this information may be locked by your University and you cannot edit it using Handshake.\nIf any inaccuracies are

associate yourself with a current Handshake Employer Partner (\u201cEmployer Partner\u201d) and be approved by that employer or create a new Employer Account.\nEmployer Partners do not have access to any student profiles unless they are approved by Handshake, or the student\u2019s University, to access student information that the student chooses to share.\n</p>\n<p> You have the option to provide additional information when creating your account, such as a profile picture or professional skills, and to upload documents, such as your resume or transcript.\nAny information or content you upload directly to the Handshake Service is governed by these Terms.\n</p>\n<p> You agree that any information you provide through account registration is accurate, current, and complete, and you agree to

Accounts initiated by University Partners, student information provided to Handshake by the University is private by default.\n</p>\n<p> If a profile is set to \u201cprivate,\u201d employers and other students will not be able to see any information about you.\nWhere available, all Career Center features, such as scheduling and appointments, are still accessible to private profiles.\nYou may still apply for job opportunities when your profile is set to private.\nWhen you submit an application for a job with your profile set to private, limited information provided by you or directly by your University will become visible to that specific employer\u2014including your name, the University you attend, and your educational college (engineering, liberal arts, etc.)\u2014but any other personal information in your profile will be hidden or masked, including your profile photo, GPA, sponsorship status, professional skills, personal bio, and resume.\n</p>\n<p> You can change your privacy settings at any time while your account is active by opening User Settings from the Account Dashboard.\nThis includes changing your profile from public to private, or making your GPA, which is private by default, public.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Recording of Handshake Communications</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Wiretapping laws in some U.S.\nstates prohibit recording individuals without their awareness and consent.\nYou may not initiate an audio or video recording of any third party in violation of the law.\nBy initiating any audio or video recording through the Service, you represent and warrant that you have express permission from all persons appearing in the audio or video recording for all potential uses by Handshake of such audio or video recording where required by law.\nYou agree that you will not hold us responsible and we will not be liable for your failure to inform others that you are recording them and/or your failure to obtain their prior consent.\n</p>\nContinuing Support\n<p> Handshake is committed to helping you succeed in the professional world during school and beyond.\nAfter you graduate or leave your University, we encourage you to update your contact information with a personal email address, so you won\u2019t lose access to your profile once your student email address expires, and to keep your profile current.\nAny information you share directly with Handshake is subject to these Terms and our Privacy Policy.\n</p>\nCreating an Employer Account\n<p> When you create a Handshake Employer Account, we request contact information, including email address and telephone number, to provide a point of contact for Universities and administrative staff and which will be made available on your public profile.\nYou have the option to set your profile as \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d during account creation, and may change your account visibility at any time by opening User Settings from the Account Dashboard.\nWe will not use your phone number to send any commercial or marketing messages to you from third parties.\nYou agree to provide accurate and current information and to correct any misrepresentations immediately upon discovery.\n</p>\n<p> When you create a Handshake Employer Account, all universities will have access to information used to create the account.\nStudents will only have access to that information if you make your profile public.\nOnce your account has been approved by participating Universities, you will receive student data through our Service.\nYou are prohibited from disclosing or sharing this information with other parties, and agree to keep student data confidential.\nYou shall only use student data to provide the employer services to the student and not use, sell, or disclose Handshake Data for any purposes including data analytics, data monetization, advertising, marketing or any other purpose even if such Handshake Data is aggregated or de-identi\ufb01ed.\nYou agree to handle and maintain collected student data with equivalent or superior standards as those described in our Privacy Policy, including the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 regarding any Student Personal Data you receive from Handshake.\n</p>\n<p> You also agree not to use the Service to send spam or other unauthorized communications, and you agree not to use any collected student data for purposes not authorized by Handshake.\nThese prohibitions are addressed in further detail below.\n</p>\nEmployer Account Guidelines\n<p> Through the use of the Service, you will be able to search and filter student results based on a wide range of criteria.\nYou agree to maintain a fair and equitable recruitment process when selecting student candidates.\nYou also agree not to discriminate based on ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or veteran status as prohibited by law.\nYou have the ability to contact students directly through the Service.\nBy using this Service, you agree not to stalk, defame, bully, harass, abuse, threaten, intimidate, or impersonate any people or entities.\n</p>\n<p> Employer Accounts are administered by designated Account Administrators.\nIf the employer chooses to allow additional individual employees to access the Handshake Service through the Employer Account, you agree that the account administrators are responsible for the use of the Service by those individual employees, including requests related to personal data collected from those individual employees.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Handshake is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than these Terms or our Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p> You acknowledge and agree, moreover, that, to ensure your compliance with these Terms, Handshake may review the application flow associated with any new post before it becomes available to applicants on the Handshake Service.\n</p>\nThird Party Recruiter Guidelines\n<p> Handshake is excited to offer as many career opportunities to students as possible, including those offered by third party recruiters.\nHowever, we do not permit outside services to bulk collect student data, employer data, job descriptions, or other marketplace information through the use of automated scripts (\u201cscraping\u201d), or similar or other technologies or methodologies.\nTo protect our users and their data privacy, moreover, you may not use the data of students or other users for the purpose of marketing any employment opportunities other than the opportunity the applicant applied to through the Handshake Service.\nFor the same reason, you may not store any student\u2019s or other user\u2019s data for the purpose of (1) marketing employment opportunities to the applicant in the future.\nor (2) allowing any third party to use the data for marketing or any other reason.\nThird party recruiters are also prohibited from requiring students to create an account on a third-party platform unaffiliated with the company or brand providing the employment role.\nAny violation of these or any other Terms, at our discretion, may result in suspension or termination of the account(s) associated with you or your recruitment service.\n</p>\nNo Spam\n<p> We want Handshake to be a platform where employers and recruiters can connect with students and other users in a way that is productive for all involved.\nTo that end, while we allow employers and recruiters to contact students and other users, we do not allow you to use the Service to send unsolicited marketing messages or broadcasts (i.e., spam).\n</p>\n<p> Spam can take many forms, and our rules are meant to address a wide range of inappropriate content or messaging, including: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unsolicited messages that aim to drive traffic or attention from the Handshake Service to accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives not directly related to a job opportunity posted on the platform.\n</li>\n<li>Bulk or repeated identical messages, or high-volume messages with a low student response rate.\n</li>\n<li>Messages that fail to comply with applicable anti-spam laws and regulations.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> If we determine that you have sent spam or other unauthorized content, we may take any action we deem necessary to protect our users\u2019 experience or the Service, including demanding that you cease violating these Terms, suspending your student messaging privileges, or suspending or terminating your account(s).\n</p>\nCareer Center Accounts\n<p> Career Centers retain access to data as part of their administrative duties.\nCareer Center employees are able to view any student profile associated with their University, including hidden data and private profiles.\n</p>\nGeneral Guidelines for Students and Employers\nThe Content You Submit Belongs to

that your activities are lawful in every jurisdiction where you access or use the service.\n</p>\n<p> The Handshake parties do not endorse content and specifically disclaim any responsibility or

does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\u201d </p>\n<p> Handshake is not responsible for the actions, content, information, or data of third parties, and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties.\n</p>\nIndemnification\n<p> Unless prohibited by law, You (and

Resolution\n<p> You agree that any dispute between you and Handshake arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, the Handshake Service, or any other Handshake products or services (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Governing Law:</strong> The Terms of Service and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Informal Dispute Resolution:</strong> We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.\nBefore filing a claim against Handshake, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting us here.\nWe'll try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email.\nIf a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or Handshake may bring a formal proceeding.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We Both Agree To Arbitrate:</strong> You and Handshake agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate:</strong> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting us here within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement.\nArbitration Procedures: The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nThe arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco, California, or any other location we agree to.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Fees:</strong> The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nHandshake will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000.\nHandshake will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate: </strong>Without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process described above, either you or Handshake (1) may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California, or any United States county where you live or work and seek an amount up to the jurisdictional limit for individuals in such small claims court<em>&nbsp;</em>(notwithstanding any limitation on such damages set forth herein), or (2) may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief (including, in the case of Handshake, to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Handshake products or Handshake Service), or for infringement or material breach of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights).\n.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No Class Actions:</strong> You may only resolve Disputes with Handshake on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed under our agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Judicial Forum for Disputes:</strong> In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Handshake agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California.\nBoth you and Handshake consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.\nWe both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Limitation on Claims:</strong> Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Handshake products or Handshake Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.\n</p>\nGoverning Law &amp.\nVenue\n<p> These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.\n</p>\n<p> If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of Service and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\nHandshake\u2019s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.\nNo waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition.\n</p>\nEntire Agreement\n<p> If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity.\nThese Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Handshake and governs your use of the Service, unless you have a separate signed agreement with Handshake that states it supersedes this Terms of Service.\n</p>\n<p> You will not assign the Terms of Service or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of Handshake.\nAny purported assignment or delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Handshake will be null and void.\nHandshake may assign these Terms of Service or any rights hereunder without your consent.\n</p> ", "created_at": "2021-11-02 02:53:37.049649",
