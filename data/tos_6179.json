has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online

technology standard.\nWhile some progress has been made, it has been slow.\nNo standard has been adopted to this date and, as a result, we are not equipped to respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d
