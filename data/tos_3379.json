commercial websites and\nonline services to post a privacy policy.\nThe law's reach stretches well beyond\nCalifornia to require any person or company in the United States (and\nconceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable\nInformation from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on\nits website stating exactly the information being collected

Principles form the backbone of privacy law in\nthe United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role\nin the development of data protection laws around the globe.\nUnderstanding the\nFair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is\ncritical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal\ninformation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the\nfollowing responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong>\n<br> We will notify you via email within 7 business days<br> We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that\nindividuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data\ncollectors

government agencies to investigate\nand/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How it Works</li>\n<li>FAQ</li>\n<li>Ambassador
