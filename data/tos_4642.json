during your visit to our web site but browse, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit.\nThis information does not identify you personally.\nWe automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:</p>\n<p>The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used.\nThe Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer.\nWe use the Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you.\nThis address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service provider (e.g.\nxcompany.com or yourschool.edu).\nGenerally, the City only determines visitor domain names if a security issue is suspected;<br>The type of browser and operating system you used;<br>The date and time you visited this site;<br>The web pages or services you accessed at this site.</p>\n<p>For site management purposes, information is collected for statistical purposes.\nThe City\u2019s web site uses software programs to create summary statistics, which are used for such purposes as assessing what information is of most and least interest, determining technical design specifications, and identifying system performance or problem areas.</p>\n<p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, the City\u2019s web site employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.\nExcept for authorized law enforcement investigations and the security purposes mentioned elsewhere in this notice, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.\nRaw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with public records retention schedules.</p>\n<p>Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the state Computer Trespass law and federal statutes including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National

engaging in the transaction by other means, including by telephone or in-person while visiting a City facility.\nIn all cases, the City strives to collect the minimum information necessary to comply with applicable law or provide the service requested.</p>\n<p>The City does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute visitor\u2019s information, including electronic mail addresses, to any outside company or organization, unless legally required to do so.\nThis applies to information that may be collected on the City\u2019s site and on that of any third party with whom the City contracts to provide Internet related services.</p> Section C.\nPersonal Information and Choice\n<p>You may choose whether to provide personal information on-line.\n\u201cPersonal information\u201d is information

children on-line or by email will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.</p> Section D.\nPublic Access to Information\n<p>In the State Of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and information possessed by City government.\nAt the same time, there are exceptions to the public\u2019s right to access public records that serve various needs including the privacy of individuals.\nBoth state and federal laws provide exceptions.\nRCW 42.17.260(9)
