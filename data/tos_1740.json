That\u2019s what makes them so fun! We\u2019ll let you know in the contest or sweeps rules what information we\u2019re collecting, but all the info about how we handle the information is found right here in this privacy statement! </li>\n<li>\n<em>Why:</em> We collect this information so that we can choose a winner or winners, and so that we can fulfill any prize obligations.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Product Surveys</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>What:</em> We are all about making sure the new products we are mixing up are tasty and delicious and what you want! To make sure we are on the right track, we\u2019ll sometimes we run some surveys.\nWe have a couple different kinds \u2013 we may ask our fan club members about what they like or dislike, and in that we might collect different sorts of information.\nParticipation in these types of surveys is always voluntary, and it\u2019s anonymized as soon as possible and personal information deleted.\nWe also sometimes test new products at certain super-secret stores and if you are lucky enough to catch one of these test products, we may ask you to complete a survey about the product.\nFor these product surveys, we ask for your email address, age range, and gender.\nWhen you complete a test product survey, we\u2019ll also ask if you want to be added to one of our fan clubs.\nIf that happens, head on back to the fan clubs section to understand the what and why of our collection.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Why:</em> For all of our surveys, we collect this information so that we can improve our products or our marketing.\nFor the test product surveys, we collect your email address so we can offer you a coupon for helping us out, and we ask for your age range and gender to help us ensure the product we\u2019re testing has a wide range of consumer appeal.\nThe individual data gets rolled up to into statements like \u201cthis flavor skewed 60% female\u201d or \u201cthe Sour Patch Kids <em>Blizzard\u00ae </em>treat skews towards Millennials.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Experience Surveys</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>What</em>: We love making happy for our fans!

Well, not exactly.\nAs we mentioned earlier, most <em>DQ</em>\u00ae restaurants are independently owned and operated franchises, which means it\u2019s the owner of each store that is selling delicious <em>DQ</em>\u00ae products.\nIn addition, the \u201cGift Cards and Gear\u201d link on our website is run by a licensed third party vendor.\nEvery once in a while though, we decide there is a special enough opportunity that we want to offer special products to our fans.\nA great example of this is our limited time offer fall <em>Blizzard</em>\u00ae Treat candle collection.\nHow will you know that we are running the offer instead of a third party vendor? Well, the easiest way is to check out the privacy statement on the website.\nIf it links to this one right here, then you know!

So who do we share with?</p>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>One big happy company family.</strong> We share data within the DQ\u00ae/Orange Julius\u00ae family of companies, mostly because we all work together out of the same office spaces and try to streamline where we can.\nOur family includes American Dairy Queen Corporation and Orange Julius of America, which are U.S.\nbased companies, and Dairy Queen Canada Inc.\nand Orange Julius Canada Limited, which are Canadian companies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Franchisees.</strong> Most of the time, your information stays here at our corporate headquarters.\nBut sometimes the best one to take care of you is the franchisee who owns your local DQ<sup>\u00ae</sup> restaurant! We share some information with our franchisees when you order a cake from them, we\u2019ll share some when you get in touch with our Fan Relations team about a celebration or a concern related to a specific DQ\u00ae location, and we\u2019ll share some info from an experience survey if you tell us you want to be contacted by the location about your experience.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Vendors.</strong> We\u2019re actually a pretty small team around here, so we get a little help from our friends.\nThese are companies with pretty specialized skills, and any company who gets personal information about you from us has agreed that they\u2019ll only use your personal information for exactly what we ask them to do.\nThese vendors may help us with things like hosting, data management and storage, marketing or remarketing, website or marketing analytics, email services for our loyalty clubs, services to assist us with responding to you if you send us a comment, question, or complaint, for contest or sweepstakes administration and fulfillment, for employment application processing, surveys, product fulfillment, and other similar services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Police &amp.\nlegal people.</strong> We will share information if we are required to by law, or if we need to in order to cooperate with an investigation or defend our family of companies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>New owners.</strong> Hey, we\u2019d be just as surprised as the next fan, but if we merge, sell, or otherwise reorganize in our corporate family, we\u2019ll pass on your personal information as part of the deal.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>For our visitors from California.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>California\u2019s Business and Professions Code section 22575
