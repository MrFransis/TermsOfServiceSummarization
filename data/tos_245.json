real-world stock photosPrivacy Policy<p>\n<strong>Welcome to Envato\u2019s Privacy Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hi there, we\u2019re Envato Pty Ltd (ABN 11 119 159 741) of Level 1, 121 King Street Melbourne, 3000, Australia (\u201c<strong>Envato</strong>\u201d) and welcome to our privacy policy which also applies to our Affiliate Companies.\nThis policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you\u2019re an Envato user or visitor to our Sites.\nIt applies across Envato Elements, Envato Market, Envato Twenty20, Envato Studio, Envato Sites, Envato Tuts+ and Placeit (the \u201c<strong>Sites</strong>\u201d).</li>\n<li>When we say \u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019 or \u2018Envato\u2019 it\u2019s because that\u2019s who we are and we own and run the Sites.</li>\n<li>If we say \u2018policy\u2019 we\u2019re talking about this privacy policy.\nIf we say \u2018user terms\u2019 we\u2019re talking about the rules for using each of the Sites.\nThe rules vary by product and each product makes them separately available and seeks consent to them separately to this policy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>The type of personal information we collect</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We collect certain personal information about visitors and users of our Sites.</li>\n<li>The most common types of information we collect include things like: user-names, member names, email addresses, IP addresses, other contact details, survey responses, blogs, photos, payment information such as payment agent details, transactional details, tax information, support queries, forum comments (if applicable), content you direct us to make available on our Sites (such as item descriptions), your actions on our Sites (including any selections or inputs into items) and web and email analytics data.\nWe will also collect personal information from job applications (such as, your CV, the application form itself, cover letter and interview notes).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>How we collect personal information</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We collect personal information directly when you provide it to us, automatically as you navigate through the Sites, or through other people when you use services associated with the Sites.</li>\n<li>We collect your personal information when you provide it to us when you complete membership registration and buy or provide items or services on our Sites, subscribe to a newsletter, email list, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication.</li>\n<li>As the operator of digital content marketplaces, we have a legitimate interest in verifying the identity of our authors.\nWe believe that knowing who our authors are will strengthen the integrity of our marketplaces by reducing fraud, making authors more accountable for their content and giving Envato and customers the ability to enforce contracts for authors who break the rules.\nEnvato also has certain legal obligations that require us to know who our authors are in certain circumstances.\nIn light of this, if you are an author we will verify your identity, in particular, your name, full address and date of birth by asking you to show us a Photo ID document.\nThe verification procedure is called Envato Verify.\nEnvato Verify will be carried out by our service provider Jumio Corporation located at 395 Page Mill Road, Suite 150, Palo Alto, California, USA.\nAs part of Envato Verify, you will be asked to take a selfie which will then be compared against your Photo ID document using facial recognition technology.\nWe will use your Photo ID document solely to carry out Envato Verify and delete it after the completion of this process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal information we collect about you from others</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Although we generally collect personal information directly from you, on occasion, we also collect certain categories of personal information about you from other sources.\nIn particular:<ol>\n<li>financial and/or transaction details from payment providers located in the US, UK, and Australia in order to process a transaction;</li>\n<li>third party service providers (like Google, Facebook) who are located in the US or UK, which may provide information about you when you link, connect, or login to your account with the third party provider and they send us information such as your registration and profile from that service, this only occurs if you are using Envato Studio.\nThe information varies and is controlled by that service provider or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service provider.\nand</li>\n<li>other third party sources/and or partners from Australia, US or UK, whereby we receive additional information about you (to the extent permitted by applicable law), such as demographic data or fraud detection information, and combine it with information we have about you.\nFor example, fraud warnings from service providers like identity verification service.\nWe also receive information about you and your activities on and off the Envato platform through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our partner ad networks.\nWe also receive information about you as a rights holder from our third party authors.\nFor example, information in the form of a model release when your image is used in an item made available on our Sites.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>How we use personal information</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We will use your personal information:<ol>\n<li>To fulfil a

welcome! We\u2019re happy to have you here and we hope you enjoy your stay.\nWhen we say \u2018<strong>we</strong>\u2019, \u2018<strong>us</strong>\u2019 or \u2018<strong>Envato</strong>\u2019 it\u2019s because that\u2019s who we are and we own and run the <strong>Envato Market</strong> sites.\n</p>\n<p>2.\nEnvato\u2019s ecosystem of digital marketplaces helps millions of people around the world get creative and earn online.\nWhen you create an account and accept these terms you become a <strong>member</strong> of our community.\nYou will have an <strong>Envato Market account</strong> that will allow you to buy and sell <strong>items</strong> like the ones found on the Envato Market sites and make other related transactions.\n</p>\n<p>3.\nThe Envato Market sites are platforms that allow members to buy and sell licenses to use digital items like website themes, production music, motion graphics project files, software code, vectors, images and much, much more.\nOn Envato Market, buyers and authors (sellers) transact with each other directly and we provide the platform to allow the transactions to happen.\nIf you have an Envato Market account, any transactions are logged on your member\u2019s statement, which records the payments made by you to authors via Envato Market (as a <strong>buyer</strong>) and by buyers via Envato Market to you (as an <strong>author</strong>).\n</p>\n<p>4.\nThe items on Envato Market are owned by the authors, not by us.\nThe items on Envato Market are uploaded at the direction of the author.\nWe provide the platform services.\nwe do not take ownership of the items.</p>\n<p>5.\nDuring your time with us you agree to follow the ground rules outlined in these terms so please read and understand them.\nIf you don\u2019t accept the terms then we\u2019ll be sad, but you will need to leave because your presence on and use of the Envato Market sites is conditional on your acceptance to be bound by these terms and the Acceptable Use Policy whether you become a member or not.\n</p> Envato Websites\n<p>6.\nYou can also access Envato Websites via the Envato Market sites.\nThe products offered on Envato Websites (which include hosted theme and hosted starter site subscriptions) are offered by Envato Hosted and Envato Sites and are subject to separate terms and conditions, which you can access here: Envato Hosted Terms and Envato Sites Terms.\nTo avoid any doubt, the Envato Market terms do not apply to the products offered via Envato Websites.\n</p>\n<p>7.\n<strong>Preview Files</strong>: If you stream or download a preview file from our Envato Market sites, you agree that you will not remove any watermarking or other protective measures from the preview file.\nYou agree that you will use the preview file solely for the purposes of evaluating a purchase from Envato Market sites and not for any other purpose.\n</p> How browsing and membership works <p>8.\n<strong>Browsing</strong>: You need to be 16 years or over to browse the Envato Market sites.\nWe don\u2019t knowingly collect any information from anyone aged 16 or under.\nWhen browsing the sites you agree to follow our guidelines or instructions and keep in mind that these terms apply to any use of our Envato Market sites whether or not you\u2019re a member.\n</p> Membership <p>9.\n<strong>Age</strong>: You need to be 18 years or over to become a member or to buy items.\nIf you\u2019re under 18 you will need to get a parent or guardian to buy items or use the account of a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years of age, with their permission, and this adult will be responsible for all your activities.\n</p>\n<p>10.\n<strong>Envato Account</strong>: Membership is free.\nWhen you become a member you get an Envato Market account that is accessible from any of our Envato Market sites (and is also your Envato account for other Envato services).\nYour membership will allow you to \u2018buy\u2019 (license) items from authors, participate in our online forums, and generally contribute to our ecosystem of Envato Market sites that help people get creative.\nMembership also gives you the opportunity to become an author (see <strong>section 31 \u2013 Becoming an Author</strong>) or earn referral income (see <strong>section 12 \u2013 Referrals</strong>).\n</p>\n<p>11.\n<strong>Your responsibility</strong>: You promise that information you give us is true, accurate and complete and, if you sign up for an Envato Market account, that you will keep your account information up-to-date (including a current email address).\nYour membership is not transferable, that means you cannot sell your account.\nYou are responsible for any use of the Envato Market sites including any activity that occurs in conjunction with your username and password, if you have an Envato Market account, so keep your password secure and don\u2019t let any other person use your username or password.\nIf you realise there\u2019s any unauthorized use of your password or any breach of security you need to let us know immediately.\nYou must not use a virtual private network or VPN or any other means to avoid compliance with these terms and conditions, or for any fraudulent or illegal reasons.</p> It is important that you understand your responsibilities as a member of our community so please take the time to review this section and the Envato Market Terms carefully.\n<p>12.\n<strong>Referrals</strong>: As a part of our Affiliate Program, if you refer a new member to any of our Envato Market sites you may be eligible to receive affiliate income.\nYou can find out more about the Affiliate Program and the terms applying to referrals here.\n</p> How buying items works This section will help you understand what you are buying when you purchase an item and how that transaction takes place on Envato Market.\n<p>13.\n<strong>What you're buying:</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>License</strong>: When you <strong>buy</strong> an item, you acquire the right to use that item.\nyou're not actually acquiring the item itself.\nWhat you get includes a license directly from the author to use that item.\nItems are subject to specific terms of use, and these terms are the \u2018license\u2019 that we set on Envato Market.\nThis license also applies to you if you download an item that someone else has bought for you (because anyone downloading an item needs to be an Envato Market member).\nDifferent license types are available for you to choose when you have selected an item.\nYou\u2019ll need to think about the way you want to use the item so that you can pick the right license to allow that use.\nIt\u2019s your responsibility to choose the correct license.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Item support</strong>: Authors can choose whether or not to support certain items.\nIf an author chooses to support an item, this will be identified on the item page.\n&nbsp;All supported items include a support period.\nYou can buy support extensions on these items.\nYour right to access Item Support requires an Envato Market account.\nTo learn more about item support, like what items are covered, what authors provide, the support period and support extension options, see the item support policy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Buyer Services</strong>: In addition to the use of the platform, when you \u2018buy\u2019 an item you also receive buyer services from Envato like 24/7 buyer support, fraud protection, item quality control and other related buyer services.\nYou can read more about the awesome buyer services buyers get from us over at Why Buy From Us information page.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>14.\nThe total price for an item on Envato Market is made up of:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Item price</strong>: The item price is made up of a license fee (for the license you choose for the item), and if relevant the item support fee (for supported items).\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Buyer fee</strong>: This is the fee for the buyer services you get from Envato.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Handling fee</strong>: In some transactions on Envato Market the total checkout price may include a handling fee.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Taxes</strong>: Some transactions on Envato Market may be subject to tax that may be added to the price.\nSee <strong>section 23</strong> for details about taxes on Envato Market.\n</li>\n</ol> The <strong>list price</strong> is made up of the item price and buyer fee, and is the price you see on an item page.\nTransacting as a buyer: <p>15.\nIf you have an Envato Market account, you can make payments by using the \u2018Buy Now\u2019 function or by using any existing Envato Credits in your Envato Market account.\n</p>\n<p>16.\n<strong>Envato Credits</strong>: Existing Envato Credits can only be used to pay for Envato Market transactions.\nWe do not refund any monies originally placed into your Envato Market account to buy Envato Credits (but you may have rights under an applicable consumer law, which we don\u2019t exclude).\n</p>\n<p>17.\nIf you choose to buy using any existing Envato Credits, the total price will be deducted from your Envato Credits.\nIf you haven\u2019t used your Envato Credits within 12 months they may expire from the date of purchase.\nSee section 24 for details about the expiry of Envato Credits.\n</p>\n<p>18.\nWhen using <strong>Buy Now</strong> you will be redirected to a <strong>payment method</strong> provider.\n</p>\n<p>19.\n<strong>Currency conversion costs</strong>: You are responsible for all costs of currency conversion relating to a transaction on Envato Market.\nYour financial institution does the currency conversion and may charge you additional fees (we don\u2019t control either the conversion rates or your financial institution\u2019s fees).\n</p> This means that you may incur additional costs when purchasing from Envato Market, which we have no control over.\n<p>20.\n<strong>Terms of buying</strong>: When you buy an Envato Market item you\u2019re doing so on the following terms:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> you warrant to us and the author that you have carefully considered the suitability of your chosen license, and that you have chosen appropriately.\n</li>\n<li> you cannot cancel a completed purchase of an item.\n</li>\n<li> we and the authors do not promise that any particular item will continue to be available on Envato Market so you should download and save the item as soon as you buy it.\n</li>\n<li> once you buy or download an item and the item has been paid for, you acquire a non-exclusive license to use the item under the terms set out in the license (non-exclusive means others might also license the same item).\n</li>\n<li> the author retains ownership of the item.\n</li>\n<li> your relevant details may be provided to the author of the item in order to facilitate the transaction, for example for invoicing and item support services.\nand </li>\n<li> we have the right to enforce against you the terms of the license that you have acquired from an author.\n</li>\n</ol> It is important that you understand the terms on which you are making a purchase.\nPlease take the time to review this section carefully.\nSee our Help Center article for information about account limits.\n<p>21.\n<strong>Warranties we make</strong>:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> We warrant that the Envato Market sites will be suitable for the purposes described on the sites, and that we will provide our platform services with reasonable skill and care.\n</li>\n<li> We otherwise do not make any express or implied warranties about the Envato Market sites (or any items on the Envato Market sites).\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>22.\n<strong>Warranties authors make</strong>: The author of an item you buy warrants to you that:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> the item is of acceptable quality and fit for the purpose for which it is 'sold'.\n</li>\n<li> the item matches the description given by the author on the item preview page, as well as any item preview.\n</li>\n<li> they will honour any express warranties given to you that are not contained in these terms.\n</li>\n<li> they have the rights necessary to license that item on the terms of applicable license.\n</li>\n<li> your use of that item in accordance with the terms of the applicable license does not infringe the intellectual property rights of someone else.\n</li>\n<li> the item and its description are not false, inaccurate, misleading, fraudulent, unlawful or defamatory.\n</li>\n<li> the item and its description do not violate any applicable law or regulation (including those governing export control, consumer protection, unfair competition, criminal law, pornography, anti-discrimination, trade practices or fair trading).\n</li>\n<li> the item does not contain viruses or other computer codes, files or programs which are designed to limit or destroy the functionality of other computer software or hardware.\n</li>\n<li> if the item is marked as 'supported', they will provide you with the services as outlined in the item support policy.\n</li>\n<li> they will process your data in accordance with applicable privacy law and data protection regulations.\n</li>\n</ol> This is what authors are promising you when you buy an item.\n<p>23.\n<strong>Taxes</strong>:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Australian GST, European VAT and US Sales Tax.\n</strong> Prices and fees for supplies made to you (whether by Envato or authors) in connection with these terms exclude Australian GST, European VAT and US Sales Tax, unless stated otherwise on our site.\nIf a supply is made to you under or in connection with these terms on which Australian GST, European VAT or US Sales Tax is imposed, any applicable fee that is charged for that supply is increased by, and you must also pay, an amount equal to the GST, VAT or US Sales Tax payable (by Envato or the author) on that supply.\nFor more information on Australian GST and European VAT as they apply to buyers, see EU VAT Information for Buyers and AU GST Information for Buyers and US Sales Tax Information for Buyers.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other taxes.</strong> Prices, fees and charges are otherwise inclusive of other applicable taxes unless stated otherwise on our site.\nYou are responsible for paying all such taxes and imposts associated with your use of Envato Market wherever levied.\nYour responsibility includes withholding tax if it applies, unless we already process that withholding tax.\nWe may collect geographical location information to determine your location, which may be used for tax purposes (so location information you give us must be accurate for tax residency purposes).\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>24.\n<strong>Envato Credits expire</strong>: Envato Credits expire if not used within 12 months from the date of purchase, and will be forfeited on the 12 month anniversary of the purchase date.\nWe generally try to tell you beforehand when Envato Credits are going to expire and be forfeited, but this is not always possible and don\u2019t promise to warn you.\nCheck your member\u2019s statement regularly for details of expiry dates.\nIf you have different rights under an applicable consumer law, we don\u2019t exclude them.\n</p> If you haven\u2019t used your Envato Credits within 12 months they may expire.\n<p>25.\n<strong>Items with an incorrect price or incorrect information</strong>: Despite our reasonable efforts, items may occasionally be listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information.\nIf this happens, we may cancel or reverse a transaction, even after it is completed and a payment has been processed.\nIf we do this, we\u2019ll promptly arrange for any payment to be credited or refunded and you must not use the item unless you re-purchase it at the correct price.\n</p> Refunds <p>26.\nGiven the nature of digital content, a refund or credit on a purchase is not granted unless one of the warranties given by the author in section 22 has been breached, or a refund is required under the Envato Market Refund Rules or Australian consumer law or other relevant consumer protection laws.\nIf you would like to request a refund see this Help Centre article.\n</p>\n<p>27.\nWe will assess refund or credit requests (if you have an Envato Market account) on their merits, considering the digital nature of Envato Market items and the type of item preview that was available before purchase.\nThere is generally no obligation to provide a refund or credit in situations like the following:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> you have changed your mind about an item.\n</li>\n<li> you bought an item by mistake.\n</li>\n<li> you do not have sufficient expertise to use the item.\n</li>\n<li> you ask for goodwill.\nor </li>\n<li> you can no longer access the item because it has been removed (we advise you to download items as soon as you buy them to avoid this situation).\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>28.\nIf the author or we decide to issue a refund or credit (if you have an Envato Market account), this will generally be done using the same manner used to make the purchase.\nSo if the item was purchased using Envato Credits, you will be given credit in Envato Credits.\nif the item was purchased using a particular payment method you will be refunded using the same payment method in reverse.\nAny payment made to you (not Envato Credits) will be made in US Dollars, under the rules of the payment method (see <strong>section 19 - Currency conversion costs</strong> about currency conversion back to your local currency).\n</p> It is important that you understand how refunds work on Envato Market.\n<p>29.\n<strong>Disputes lodged with payment agents</strong>: If, as a buyer via your Envato Market account, you lodge a dispute with a payment agent, this will result in a freezing of your Envato Market account until the dispute raised with the payment agent has been cancelled.\nThis makes it very complex to resolve any related issues, and means we cannot make payments or issue refunds out of your Envato Market account, so we encourage buyers to contact us directly first to see if we can help resolve any concerns.\n</p>\n<p>30.\n<strong>Fine print</strong>: We are not a bank or licensed deposit taker in Australia or elsewhere, your credits are not deposits under Australian law about banks, and that means you don\u2019t get the benefit of any deposit insurance or guarantee under those laws.\nWe don\u2019t act as a fiduciary or as a trustee for you, and we\u2019re not a licensed financial service provider.\n</p> Becoming an author <p>31.\nIf you want to get involved in our community as an author, you can sign up and find out more here.\nRemember that if you become an author these terms will continue to apply, along with the Author Terms you\u2019ll sign up to as an

'<strong>benefit</strong>') is given in our favour in these terms, the Author Terms or Affiliate Terms, we hold that benefit on trust for the other Envato Companies.\nWe may enforce that benefit as trustee for and on behalf of the other Envato Companies as beneficiaries under that trust.\n</p>\n<p>46.\nWe may use the services of another Envato Company to conduct payment or other activities with you, like collecting payments and paying author earnings.\nIf you make a Buy Now payment, we receive your payment as a limited agent for the author and your obligation to pay the author is met when we (or another Envato Company) receive the payment successfully.\n</p> Liability and indemnity - between us and you <p>47.\nWe provide the Envato Market sites and the platform services, not the items on the Envato Market sites.\n</p>\n<p>48.\nYou indemnify us against all losses, costs (including legal costs on a full indemnity basis), expenses, demands or liability that we incur arising out of, or in connection with, a third party claim against us relating to your use of Envato Market and any content you post to Envato Market (including, if you are an author, your items).\n</p>\n<p>49.\nIf you are a buyer, you agree that we are not responsible for, and you release us from liability arising out of or in connection with: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>the items on Envato Market;</li>\n<li>information provided by authors about their items (including on any item page).\nand</li>\n<li>your use of items from Envato Market.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>50.\nOur liability to you in connection with Envato Market or these terms, in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, is limited as follows: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>we exclude liability for any of these things incurred by you: loss of revenue, loss of profit, loss of goodwill, loss of customers, loss of capital, damage to reputation, loss in connection with any other contract, loss of data, or indirect, consequential or special loss, damage or expense.\nand;</li>\n<li>our total liability to you is limited to the greater of USD100 and the total buyer fees paid by you in the 12 months before liability accrued.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p> These sections mean that you protect us from costs and claims that happen because of your actions on the site, and that our liability to you is limited.\n<p> We may, at our expense, assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter you indemnify us against, and if so you agree to cooperate with us.\n</p> Liability and indemnity - between authors and buyers <p>51.\nEach author grants to each buyer of the author\u2019s items a limited indemnity on the following terms: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>if another person makes a claim against a buyer that the buyer's use of the item in accordance with the terms of the applicable license infringes the intellectual property or other rights of that third party.\nand</li>\n<li>if that buyer promptly notifies the author of the claim and gives the author the option to control the defense of the claim (at the author's cost), then the author will indemnify the buyer against damages finally awarded by a court against the buyer or any settlement damages agreed to by the author regarding that claim.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>52.\nThe liability of each author to their buyers is otherwise limited, for each item purchased, to the author's earnings from the payment for that item, except to the extent that the author's liability arises from wilful misrepresentations made about the item.\n</p> This means that the author's liability to buyers is limited.\n<p>53.\n<strong>Availability</strong>: We strive to have Envato Market available to you 24 hours a day, seven days a week but you know how the internet works: occasionally you might not be able to access Envato Market, and this might happen for any reason, at any time, with or without notice, or at our absolute discretion.\nWe might also change aspects of how Envato Market works.\nThe Envato Companies will not be liable to you for any loss you suffer as a result of these things.\n</p>\n<p>54.\n<strong>Third Party</strong>: If you're agreeing to these terms on behalf of someone else (like your employer), then you're promising to us that you have full legal authority to bind that third party.\n</p>\n<p>55.\n<strong>Consumer laws</strong>: In some places there may be non-excludable warranties, guarantees or other rights ('<strong>non-excludable consumer guarantees</strong>').\nWe do not exclude, restrict or modify non-excludable consumer guarantees in these terms.\nExcept for non-excludable consumer guarantees, we and authors are bound only by the express warranties made in these terms.\nOur and each author's liability for breach of a non-excludable consumer guarantee is limited, at our or the author's option, to replacing or paying the cost of replacing the relevant item or service, (unless the non-excludable consumer guarantee says otherwise).\n</p>\n<p>56.\n<strong>Blocking a member, disabling an account or refusing to process a payment.</strong> We may block you, terminate any of your Envato accounts or refuse to process a payment, including withholding your account balance indefinitely, if we reasonably believe there is a risk associated with you, your Envato account, or that payment, including if it breaches a law or regulation.\nExamples of where we might do this include transactions where we suspect the payment is from or to a person or country sanctioned by an authority (like the United Nations, the United States government or the Australian government).\nor where we reasonably believe there is a legal or regulatory risk or a risk of loss being suffered by us or our members.\nYou warrant that you are not located in a sanctioned country and are not on a sanctioned persons list.\nYou also warrant that you will not purchase items on Envato Market using funds sourced from a sanctioned country.\nWe may also block members from a country if we can\u2019t make payments to or from that country.\nYou should check what payment methods are available in your country for making payments as a buyer or for withdrawing earnings as an author.\nWe may take any of the actions stated in this section without notice and against all of your Envato accounts you use on other Envato sites.\nIf required by law we may forfeit existing deposits or earnings.\n</p> As our sites are global, there are different laws that may apply and these may restrict our relationship with you.\nSee this Help Center article for some details.\n<p>57.\n<strong>US-specific controls.</strong> Envato Market is not available to anyone located in any U.S.\nsanctioned countries or to anyone on the U.S Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals List (SDN list).\nYou must not export or re-export Envato Market items to a U.S.\nsanctioned country or to anyone on the SDN list.\n</p>\n<p>58.\n<strong>Relationship between the parties:</strong> Nothing in these terms is to be construed as constituting a partnership, joint venture, employment or agency relationship between you and us, or between you and any other member.\nNeither you nor us can bind each other in any way.\nWe are, however, an agent of the authors only for the limited purposes of collecting Buy Now payments (see section 46), the authors' providing warranties to buyers in section 22 - Warranties authors make, to limit authors' liability to buyers in section 52, and the disclaimer of authors' liability to buyers in section 55 - Consumer laws.\n</p>\n<p>59.\n<strong>Notices:</strong> Any notice you send us must be submitted via a help request.\nAny notice we send to you will be emailed to your Envato Market account email address.\n</p>\n<p>60.\n<strong>Changes to Envato Market Terms:</strong> We may change these terms at any time and, if we make changes, we will take reasonable steps to let our community know about the changes.\nYou can also keep track of whether changes have been made to our terms by referring to the version and effective date at the footer of the terms.\nYou can close your Market Account and terminate your agreement with us at any time if you do not agree to the changes.\nHowever, if you continue to use Envato Market sites after the changes are made, then you will be agreeing to the changes.\n</p>\n<p>61.\n<strong>Interpretation:</strong> Words like 'include' and 'including' are not words of limitation and where anything is within our discretion we mean our sole discretion.\n</p>\n<p>62.\n<strong>Applicable Laws:</strong> We control and operate Envato Market from our offices in Australia.\nThe laws of Victoria, Australia govern these terms, and you submit to the jurisdiction of the courts there for the resolution of any dispute between us.\n</p> Definitions <dl>\n<dt>Author:</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>a member who makes items available for sale on Envato
