against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding that would affect other users of the Services.\nThe arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.\n</p>\n<p> Any arbitration under this provision shall be held in Los Angeles, California (or, alternatively, via telephone or video conference) before and in

to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.\nArbitrations shall be conducted in English.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.\n</p>\n<p> As limited by the Federal Arbitration Act, these Terms, and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any individual Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court (excluding class arbitrations or representative actions as noted above).\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n</p>\n<p> You and MediaLab agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises before filing for arbitration.\nNotice to MediaLab must be sent to law@medialab.la.\nIf the Dispute is not resolved informally between the parties within thirty (30) days of the date of notice, then either party may initiate arbitration in accordance with these Terms.\n</p>\n<p> Any Dispute must be filed within eighteen months after it arose.\notherwise, your claim is permanently

of identifying you).\n</li>\n<li> In our backup or disaster recovery systems for a limited period of time or as required by applicable law.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> If you ever decide to stop using our Services, you can ask us to delete your information (see \u201cYOUR CHOICES\u201d to learn more).\nKeep in mind, while our systems are designed to carry out our deletion automatically, we cannot promise or guarantee that deletion will occur within a specific timeframe.\nAlso, there may be legal requirements to keep and not delete your information when you make a deletion request to us.\nThis means we may suspend deletion of or not delete your information if we receive valid legal process asking us to preserve your information, if we receive reports of abuse or other Terms of Service violations, or if your use of our Services or your information is flagged by our automated systems for abuse or other Terms of Service violations.\n</p> HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE <p> The security of your personal information is very important, and we take a number of steps to safeguard it.\nFor example, we have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification.\nWe also maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to guard your information, and we anonymize or expunge data when it is no longer necessary to provide Services to our users or substantiate records for an advertiser.\nFrom time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.\n</p>\n<p> Even so, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect, impenetrable, or 100% secure.\nWe cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information you transmit to us will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner.\nThese are the risks of being online and conducting business online.\n</p>\n<p> Of course, if we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.\nWe may also post a notice on our Services if a security breach occurs.\nDepending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing.\nIf you have any questions about the security of your information, please contact us at: privacy@medialab.la.\n</p> YOUR CHOICES <p> We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools to exercise control over the information we have about you.\nKeep in mind that each option is subject to applicable legal limitations.\nAdditionally, because your privacy is important to us, we will ask you to verify your identity/request or provide additional information before we let you exercise your choices over the information we have about you.\nWe may also reject your request for several reasons, including, by way of example only, if the request risks the privacy of other persons or is

to manage and/or disable cookies and other online tracking technologies.\nTo opt-out of the use of these technologies, you can usually change your browser options to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies.\nKeep in mind that not all devices and browsers are the same so the methods for disabling cookies on one browser may not be the same for different browsers or devices and may change at any time.\nOpting out of cookies and other tracking technologies may not preclude advertising networks from which you have not opted out from displaying customized advertising.\nIn addition, opting out will not prevent any advertising network from displaying advertising that is not customized to you and your interests and, consequently, may be less relevant to you.\nYou will need to make these choices on each browser and device you may use to visit our Services.\n</p>\n<p> When you elect to opt-out of cookies for a particular Service, an opt-out cookie is placed on your device.\nThen when you visit the same Service, the opt-out cookie tells the Service you opted out.\nThis means that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services, including preventing your consent choices from being stored.\nAs a result, we may not know about, or be able to honor, your election to opt-out.\nWe
