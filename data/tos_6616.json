document provides the privacy policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) that governs how we, MeetMatch (\u201cMeetMatch\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), use Personal Information

operate (each, together with its sub-domains, content and services, a \u201cSite\u201d).\nand (ii) the MeetMatch web and mobile software application, and any other software application, that we license (each individually, and collectively, the \u201cSoftware\u201d).\nThe Site and the App are individually and collectively referred to herein as the \u201cServices\u201d.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nIntroduction.</strong> We have implemented this Privacy Policy because your privacy, and the privacy of other users, is important to us.\nThis Privacy Policy explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your Personal Information is collected and used in connection with the Services.\n\u201cPersonal Information\u201d means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last
