from being shown more than once.\nDoubleClick may also use cookie IDs to track conversions related to ad requests.\nThis is the case, when a user sees a DoubleClick ad and then visits the advertiser's site on the same browser to make a purchase.\nAccording to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information.<br>Due to the marketing tools used, your browser

purposes so that communication for purposes other than rendering their content or services on our website is prevented or communication does not come about unless you actively decide to use the service.\nHowever, since we have no control over the data collected by third parties and its processing by them we are unable to make any binding statements pertaining to the purpose and scope of the processing of your data.<br>For further information on the purpose and scope of the collection and processing of your data, please refer to the privacy policy of the responsible provider (under data protection law) of the services or content integrated by us:<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> YouTube (videos) </li>\n<li> Google Maps </li>\n<li> MovingImage24 </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>4.7 Processing of your data by using a Connector ID (C-ID) <p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>4.7.1 Creation of the Connector ID (mutual responsibility) <br>As long as you have given C-ID online consent according to cypher 4.7.4.2, we transfer the Cookie-ID, the IP address gathered while placing the cookie, and device information to the Bertelsmann Data Services GmbH, Carl-Bertelsmann-Str.\n270, 33311 G\u00fctersloh (\u201eBDS\u201c).\nBDS processes this data to generate a unique Connector-ID (\u201eC-ID\u201c).\nSubsequently, this data is deleted by BDS.\nThe C-ID is an indicator allowing the respectively involved Bertelsmann business unit to determine which data base of the other involved Bertelsmann business units contains an existing person saved in their own data base.<br>Moreover, we transmit the ID (Customer-ID) that we have allocated to your data set to our data catalog, as well as, an anonymized data catalog to BDS.\nThe anonymized data catalog consists of aggregated, non-personal information on data saved in our customer data base (\u201canonymous data catalog\u201d).\nFor all involved Bertelsmann business units, BDS centrally gathers and manages the C-ID, the customer ID, information on the anonymous data catalog and which consent to a C-ID exists in the involved Bertelsmann business units.<br>\n<br>The data processing mentioned above happens to ensure our and the eligible interests of the other Bertelsmann business units involved based on article 6 (1) (f) DS-GVO (GDPR).\nThis initially happens, to allow us and the involved Bertelsmann business units to estimate via a request to the BDS, within which of the involved Bertelsmann business units the same C-ID exists and which potential the anonymous data catalog offers for data exchange.\nFurthermore, this is to enable us and the other involved Bertelsmann business units to exchange data based on interest assessment (cypher 4.7.2) using the C-ID or if your consent was given, to send you interesting and useful offers as well as advertisements and to design the respective websites, products and services accordingly.\n<br>\n<br>You can access the currently involved Bertelsmann business units at https://dataservices.bertelsmann.de/participatingcompanies/&nbsp;<i>\n</i> or request them postally or via email at datenschutz@bertelsmann.de.<br>For data processing during the creation of the C-ID we and BDS are mutually responsible in terms of data protection law.\nIn this respect we have determined a common agreement ac-cording to article 26 DS-GVO on who of us fulfills which duties according to the DS-GVO (GDPR).\nThis particularly affects exercising the rights of the affected persons and the fulfill-ment of the information obligation according to article 13 and 14 DS-GVO (GDPR).<br>\n<br>This agreement is necessary because personalized data is being processed in the different steps of the C-ID creation, which are either operated by us, the BDS or by both parties to-gether.\nEven when the mutual responsibility exists, in terms of data protection law, each party fulfills their own duties accordingly to their responsibilities for the individual process section as follows:<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> For the process of transmitting of the above-mentioned data we are responsible.\n</li>\n<li> For generating the C-ID we and BDS are mutually responsible.\n</li>\n<li> For managing the C-ID as well as the deletion of data described above, transmitted to BDS for the C-ID creation, BDS is responsible.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You can allege your data protection rights both with us, as described in more detail under cypher 1., and with Bertelsmann Data Services GmbH, Corporate Data Protection, Carl-Bertelsmann-Str.\n270, 33311 G\u00fctersloh, Germany, or by email at datenschutz@bertelsmann.de.You will generally receive information from the office where you have alleged your rights.</p>\n<p>\n</p>4.7.2 Processing operations using the C-ID regardless of your consent<p>\n</p>\n<p>Regardless of the presence of your consent we and other involved Bertelsmann business units can share and use your name, your address, your contact data (if available) your date of birth (if available), and interest categories using the C-ID, when the requirements of article 6 (1) (f) DS-GVO (GDPR) is present, to send you interesting and useful offers as well as advertisements and to design the respective websites, products and services accordingly.\nInterest category means belonging to a group of addressees that have similar general characteristics (e.g.\nbelonging to the same age group) or a comparable potential interest in specific products or services (e.g.\npurchases of the same product category, user of the same media content, e.g.\nTV series enthusiast).\nWhen choosing target group specific advertisement or adequate designs for offers, we can also use and additionally save anonymized information as well as data that we have received from data providers based on article 6 (1) (f) DS-GVO (GDPR), sufficiently considering your interests.</p>\n<p>\n</p>4.7.3 Right of objection<br>You can object to the use of your data for the data processing described in cypher 1.1 and 1.2 at any time, as described under cypher 7.\nYour data will then no longer be used for these purposes in the future.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>4.7.4 Processing using the C-ID based on your consent<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>4.7.4.1 Using your IP address and cookie ID to generate the C-ID<br>When you use our offer, we set a cookie with your consent, in which we store a cookie ID.\nThe cookie ID is a randomly generated character string that is used by our offer as an identifier in subsequent invocations.\nThis cookie is a small text file that is stored by your Internet browser.\nIf you have also given your C-ID online consent in accordance with cypher 4.7.4.2, we will transmit the cookie ID, the IP address collected when the cookie was set and information about your terminal device to BDS to generate the C-ID.\nThe legal basis for the collection and transmission of this data is article 6 (1) (a) DS-GVO (GDPR).<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>4.7.4.2 Consent to the cross-offer processing of data by Bertelsmann companies for analysis, product development, measurement, advertising and risk management (\"C-ID Online Consent\") <br>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you have given your consent to the cross-offer processing of data by Bertelsmann compa-nies across all offers for analysis, product development, measurement, advertising, and risk management (\"C-ID Online Consent\") to us, BDS or a Bertelsmann company involved, your data will be processed - in addition to the purposes described in cypher 4.7.2 - on the basis of article 6 (1) (a) DS-GVO (GDPR) as follows:</p>\n<p>We, the other Bertelsmann companies involved, and BDS share and use the following data (if available, hereinafter referred to as \"Online Data\") using the C-ID, in each case under our own responsibility: </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Your IP address.\n</li>\n<li> Details about the content you have requested and about your usage behavior (e.g.\nwhich web pages and sections you have viewed and when).\n</li>\n<li> the content you enter on the website (e.g.\nsearch terms, login data, ratings, form entries, click data).\n</li>\n<li> The date and time of access, information about the Internet browser you are using, the duration of your visit to the site, and the page you previously visited from which you accessed our site.\nand </li>\n<li> Device information such as the terminal device model and other information about your device (e.g.\nbrowser, language, time zone settings, operating system, platform, and screen resolution).\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>to personalize ads and content on the websites and apps of the participating Bertelsmann business units or BDS based on a profile and to measure the performance of ads and content on these websites and apps.\nFurthermore, insights can be derived about target groups that have viewed the ads and content.\nFinally, your online data may be used to build or improve the usability, systems, and software of participating Bertelsmann business units.\nFurthermore, findings/profiles derived in this way can be transmitted between the Bertelsmann companies involved on the basis of the C-ID and used for the aforementioned purposes.\n<br>Moreover, we use the C-ID to pass on your online data/profiles to other involved Bertelsmann business units so that they can automatically check whether there are any indications of possible fraudulent conduct when ordering paid content, goods or services from these Bertelsmann business units or third parties for whom this Bertelsmann business unit provides payment
