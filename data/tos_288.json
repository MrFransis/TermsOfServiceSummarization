Weebly,\nthe following terms and conditions also apply (the \u201cDomain Terms\u201d).\nYour use of\nthe Domain Services provided by Weebly serves as your consent to these terms.\nSome of the service packages include Weebly registering an Internet domain name\nor renewing your existing domain name (the \u201cDomain Name\u201d) on your behalf.\nFor\nthe purpose of procuring and/or maintaining domains, Weebly will act only as\nthe agent between you and the domain name service provider responsible for\ndomain name allocation (the \u201cRegistrar\u201d), which will be Register.com.\nAll new\nregistrations and subsequent renewals of those registrations will therefore\nalso be subject to the Register.com terms and conditions located at:\nhttp://www.register.com/policy/servicesagreement.rcmx.\nWeebly reserves the\nright to utilize another domain name service provider at any time, in which\ncase the terms and condition of such organization will apply complementarily to\nthese Domain Terms and such other domain name service provider shall be deemed\na \u201cRegistrar\u201d for purposes of these Terms.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Weebly may\nprovide one (1) free domain name for up to one year, with a new purchase of an\nannual or bi-annual subscription plan.\nThe domain will be included for the\nlifetime of your Weebly account, and the domain will be registered in your name\nand is yours to keep, as long as you cover any applicable domain registration\nfees following the first year.\nThe free domain name only applies to certain\ntop-level domains (e.g.\n.com, .net, and .org) when signing up for a new plan.\n</p>\n<p>You are\nresponsible for providing correct and complete data regarding the domain name\nholder (\u201cRegistrant\u201d) and the administrative contact when registering the\ndomain name.\nThe technical contact in all cases will be Weebly, Inc.\nBefore\napplying for a domain name, it is your responsibility to check that the domain\nname does not violate the rights of any third party or contravene any applicable\nlaw, rule or regulation.\nWe may defer activation of a domain name until payment\nof the agreed fees for the registration services has been received.\nWeebly is\nin no position to influence the allocation of the domain name by the Registrar.\nWe can neither guarantee that the requested domain names will be allocated to\nyou and/or that allocated domain names are free of third-party rights nor\nguarantee their continued existence.\nAny information we provide regarding the\navailability of a domain name is based on the data provided by third parties\nand only refers to the time that information is requested.\nThe domain will not\nbe deemed as allocated before registration of the domain in the name of you,\nthe Registrant, and its entry in the database of the Registrar.\n</p>\n<p>The initial\nregistration term for purchased domains may vary and such registration will\nauto-renew for successive 12-month periods.\nYou will be charged for\nauto-renewal forty-five (45) calendar days before your domain expires (even if\nthat date differs from your Weebly website subscription renewal date).\nYou can,\nof course, opt out of auto-renewal by turning off the auto-renew option in your\nsettings at any time before the auto-renewal takes effect.\nEach purchased\ndomain name is registered in your name and is yours to keep, as long as you pay\nthe applicable fees.\nIf you purchase a new domain, or renew an existing domain,\nand cancel your purchase within the first thirty (30) days by contacting\nhttp://hc.weebly.com, you may receive a full refund.\nYour right and title to\nyour domain name allows you to transfer a purchased domain to another domain\nprovider.\nhowever, you will not be eligible for a refund of registration fees\npaid to Weebly for transferred domains.\nRegardless of the identity of the\nRegistrant or any other contact information in your domain name records, any\ndomain name registered through Weebly using your Weebly account is covered by\nthese Terms.\n</p>\n<p>Maintaining\naccurate and current billing information is a mandatory condition of\nmaintaining your Weebly account.\nSuch data must include the full and real name\nof the Registrant, a physical mailing address (PO boxes or anonymous addresses\nare not permissible), a valid email address and telephone number.\nIf this\ninformation changes, you must immediately inform us of this change by updating\nit online.\nPlease note that if your billing information, including your current\ncredit card information, is not current, we will not renew your Domain Services\nand they may subsequently expire.\n</p>\n<p>Subject to\nthese Terms and those of the Registrar, you may transfer all domain names\nregistered through us to another domain name service provider by following the\nonline instructions provided by Weebly.\nShould we, due to failure on the part\nof you, the account holder, or the new domain name service provider, be unable\nto make the domain transfer to your new domain name service provider, we are\nexpressly entitled to have the cancelled domain name deleted by the relevant\ndomain name service provider after the cancellation date has lapsed, and we\nwill not be liable to you or any third party for such deletion.\nWe reserve the\nright to allow domain transfers only if you have settled all undisputed pending\nclaims with us.\n</p>\n<p>It may not\nalways be possible to recover a domain name after it has expired, and Weebly\nhas sole discretion in determining when a domain name can be renewed\npost-expiry and what fees will be applicable.\nIf you forfeit a domain name for\nnon-payment, Weebly will have the right, in its sole discretion, to: (a)\nregister and use the domain name for its own purpose.\n(b) sell or transfer the\ndomain name to a third party.\nor (c) delete the domain name and allow any new\nregistrant anywhere in the world to register the domain name anew.\nFurther, you\nagree that Weebly may charge the credit card you have on file with Weebly to\nrecover any amounts outstanding on your account.\n</p>\n<p>On certain\noccasions, domain name registrations may become the subject of a legal\nchallenge.\nIf Weebly is made a party to any legal action by virtue of one of\nyour domain name registrations, you agree to be responsible for all of Weebly\u2019s\ncosts and legal fees and to indemnify and hold Weebly harmless from any action.\nIf Weebly is notified that a complaint has been filed with a judicial or\nadministrative body regarding your domain name, Weebly may, at its sole\ndiscretion: (a) lock or suspend your ability to use, make modifications to, or\ntransfer your registration records.\nand/or (b) deposit control of your\nregistration record with the appropriate judicial entity by supplying a\nregistrar certificate from us.\n</p>\n<p>You must\nnotify us immediately if you lose the rights to a domain name registered by\nWeebly on your

http://hc.weebly.com.\nWe'll contact you by email to informally\nresolve the dispute.\nYou or Weebly may start a formal dispute resolution process\nif a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of your submission.\n</p>\n<p>YOU MAY ONLY\nRESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND YOU WILL NOT BRING A CLAIM\nAS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE\nACTION (E.G., CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION,\nOR CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS).\n</p>\n<p>Any claim\nrelating to these Terms that is not resolved through our informal process, or\nas set forth below, will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding\nindividual arbitration with a single arbitrator (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d) administered\nby the American Arbitration Association (<u>https://www.adr.org</u>) according to this Section and the applicable arbitration rules\nfor that forum.\nThe Arbitrator\nshall be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues,\nincluding issues relating to whether the Terms are enforceable, unconscionable\nor illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or\nestoppel.\nSubject to applicable jurisdictional requirements, you may elect to\npursue your claim in your local small-claims court rather than through\narbitration so long as your matter remains in small claims court and proceeds\nonly on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis.\nThe Federal\nArbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16, fully applies.\nIf you are a consumer\nbringing a claim relating to a transaction intended for a personal, household,\nor family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county where you\nreside.\nOtherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in San Francisco,\nCalifornia, or another mutually agreeable location.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award will\nbe binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent\njurisdiction.\nWhile an arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief,\nthe Arbitrator may do so only with respect to the individual party seeking\nrelief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the\nindividual party\u2019s claim.\nAn Arbitrator\u2019s decision and judgment thereon will\nnot have a precedential or collateral estoppel effect in any other case or\narbitration.\nWeebly will reimburse the arbitration fees due to the American\nArbitration Association for individual arbitrations brought in accordance with\nthis section for all claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the Arbitrator\ndetermines that your claims were frivolous.\nIf you prevail on any claim for\nwhich you are legally entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, you may seek to recover\nthose fees from the arbitrator.\nFor any claim where you are seeking relief, we\nwill not seek to have you pay our attorney\u2019s fees, even if fees might otherwise\nbe awarded, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.\nFor\npurposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Weebly also\ninclude respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors,\nsuccessors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the\nServices.\nSubject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above,\nyou agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in\nconsumer cases as discussed above) will be brought in and you hereby consent to\nthe exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County\nof San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of\nCalifornia.\nIf any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable,\nthat part will be construed to reflect the parties\u2019 original intent, and the\nremaining portions will remain in full force and effect.\n</p>\n<p>Either party\nmay bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or\nabuse of the Service, or to enforce intellectual property rights (e.g.,\ncopyright, trademark, trade secret, or patent rights) without first engaging in\nour informal dispute resolution process or arbitration.\nIn the event this agreement\nto arbitrate does not apply to you or your claim, any judicial proceeding will\nbe brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California.\nYou and Weebly agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of\nthe courts in San Francisco, California.&nbsp.\nREGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO\nTHE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BROUGHT BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR\nRELATED TO USE OF THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR\nAFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>\n<p>25.\nNotice to Users in\nCalifornia</p>\n<p>We want to\naddress your concerns or issues.\nPlease contact us at <u>http://hc.weebly.com</u> so that we can address your

agreements (including, but not limited to, any prior\nversions of these Terms).\nYou also may be subject to additional terms and\nconditions that may apply when you use affiliate or other services, third-party\ncontent or third-party software.\nIf any provision of these Terms or\nincorporated documents are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be\ninvalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect\nto the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other\nprovisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.\nYou agree

you are\neach waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any\npurported class action or representative proceeding.\nFurther, more than one\nperson's claims may not be
