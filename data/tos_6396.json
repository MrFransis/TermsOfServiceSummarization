Program<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>General:</strong> As part of the Services, GetUpside lets you accumulate Cash Back rewards by buying certain products with an associated Cash Back value (a \"GetUpside Offer\").\nWe have created mobile applications and websites that let our members \u201ccheck in\u201d at retail establishments and/or upload or email photos of their receipts so we can validate their purchase of products and services associated with a GetUpside Offer and begin to accumulate Cash Back rewards.\nWe may also validate our members\u2019 purchase of products associated with a GetUpside Offer through retailer or other partner-provided transaction log data, receipt data using a unique identifier (such as a loyalty card number, credit card number, phone number, etc.) to match a GetUpside member to a transaction, or the user\u2019s location as determined by the phone.\nIf we are not able to validate your purchase, or if you return, modify, or cancel the purchase, we have no obligation to issue Cash Back rewards for that purchase, and we may revoke any Cash Back rewards that was previously issued to your account for that purchase.\nGasoline sign prices displayed in the

and transactions that you personally have made.\nIf we discover that you have (1) violated the foregoing, (2) provided us with receipts or purchase confirmations for purchases and transactions made by someone other than you, or (3) provided us with fraudulent or erroneous receipts or purchase confirmations, we may deactivate your account in our sole discretion and/or deduct any fraudulently earned Cash Back rewards from your account.\nGetUpside offers are issued solely for loyalty and promotional purposes, and cannot be purchased in exchange for cash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Referral and

herein.\n(ii) purchasing advertisements featuring or promoting your personal referral code.\n(iii) posting your personal referral code at gas stations, restaurants, grocery stores, or other

Distribution Amount\u201d).\nBelow the Minimum Distribution Amount, GetUpside may prohibit redemptions of Cash Back rewards.\nGetUpside may also deduct a fee of up to $1 from your balance for using certain payment methods to redeem Cash Back rewards.\nIf applicable, the Minimum Distribution Amount and/or redemption fee will be indicated in the Cash Out feature of the mobile application.\nYou may

rewards balance.\nAll redemptions of Cash Back rewards are final and cannot be reversed or refunded.\nMembers have no property rights or other legal interest in the Cash Back rewards for any purpose.\nPrior to our fulfillment of a Distribution Request, we may, for our own account, pledge, repledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, lend or otherwise transfer or use any amount or all of an amount of cash equivalent to your Cash Back rewards balance, separately or together with other property, with all attendant rights of ownership from time to time, without notice to you and without retaining a like amount of cash in our possession or control for delivery.\nYour Cash Back rewards balance or any part of it is not transferable by you, and you cannot divide it as part of a settlement, legal proceeding or death, nor can you combine it with Cash Back rewards of any other user of the Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Payment:</strong> When you make a Distribution

provider to provide payment.\nWe assume no liability and you are solely responsible for your account with PayPal or any other approved third party electronic payment provider.\nShould we receive from PayPal or any other approved third party electronic payment provider any funds that are part of a Cash Back rewards distribution that was not distributed by PayPal or any other approved third party electronic payment provider, we will credit such amounts to your account upon your request.\nprovided that such a request occurs within sixty (60) after we have received such credits from PayPal or

NAME.\nAND</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>STATE THAT YOU REJECT ARBITRATION AND/OR PROHIBITION OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTION AND NON-INDIVIDUALIZED RELIEF.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<br> TO BE EFFECTIVE, WE MUST RECEIVE YOUR WRITTEN NOTICE WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE FIRST DATE YOU REGISTER FOR THE SERVICE.<br>\n<br> IF YOU OPT OUT, ANY DISPUTES WILL STILL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE WHERE YOU RESIDE AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW AND MUST BE BROUGHT WITHIN SUCH STATE\u2019S COURT SYSTEM.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agreement to Arbitrate<br>\n<p> This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Service as the \u201cArbitration Agreement.\u201d You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and GetUpside, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.\nFurther, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.&nbsp;YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND GETUPSIDE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\nYOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief<br>\n<p> YOU AND GETUPSIDE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND GETUPSIDE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S OR PARTY\u2019S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution<br>\n<p>GetUpside is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by emailing customer support support@getupside.com.\nIf such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice to GetUpside should be sent to Upside Services, Inc., 1701 Rhode Island Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036 (\u201cNotice Address\u201d).\nThe Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.\nIf GetUpside and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or GetUpside may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by GetUpside or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or GetUpside is entitled.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Arbitration Procedures<br>\n<p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association\u2019s (\u201cAAA\u201d) rules and procedures, including the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nFor information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.\nInformation about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA\u2019s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.\nIf there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.\nThe arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.\nAlthough arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.\nDecisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>\n<p>Unless GetUpside and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\nIf the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, GetUpside agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Costs of Arbitration<br>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the \u201cArbitration Fees\u201d) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, GetUpside will pay all Arbitration Fees.\nIf the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, GetUpside will pay your portion of such fees.\nIn addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, GetUpside will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.\nAny payment of attorneys\u2019 fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Confidentiality<br>\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Severability<br>\n<p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.\nIf a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.\nThe remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement<br>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, GetUpside agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending GetUpside written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.\nBy rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).</p>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>Termination<p>You agree that GetUpside, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if GetUpside believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service.\nAny suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.\nGetUpside may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice.\nYou agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that GetUpside may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service.\nFurther, you agree that GetUpside will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>User Disputes<p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service and GetUpside will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.\nGetUpside reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.</p>General<p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and GetUpside and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and GetUpside with respect to the Service.\nYou also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software.\nThese Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware.\nWith respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and GetUpside agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Washington, DC.\nThe failure of GetUpside to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nIf any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.\nYou agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.\nA printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.\nYou may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of GetUpside, but GetUpside may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction.\nThe section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nNotices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.\nThe Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>Your Privacy<p> At GetUpside, we respect the privacy of our users.\nFor details please see our&nbsp;Privacy Policy.\nBy using the
