respectively, and collectively the \u201cSubscription\u201d).<br>\n9.3.\nSubscription Fees.\nIn consideration for the provision of the Service (except for Trial Service and free version of the Service for specific types of Users), Customer shall pay us the applicable fees per the purchased Subscription, as set forth in the applicable Order Form (the \u201cSubscription Fees\u201d).\nUnless indicated otherwise, Subscription Fees are stated in US dollars.\nCustomer hereby authorizes us, either directly or through our payment processing service, to charge such Subscription Fees via Customer's selected payment method, upon due date.\nUnless expressly set forth herein, the Subscription Fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable.\nWe reserve the right to change the Subscription Fees at any time, upon notice to Customer if such change may affect Customer's existing subscriptions upon renewal.\nIn the event of failure to collect the Fees owed by Customer, we may, at our sole discretion (but shall not be obligated to) retry to collect at a later time, and/or suspend or cancel the Account, without notice.<br>\n9.4.\nTaxes.\nThe Subscription Fees are exclusive of any and all taxes (including without limitation, value added tax), levies, or duties, which may be imposed in respect of these Terms and the purchase or sale, of the Service hereunder (the \u201cTaxes\u201d), except for Taxes imposed on our income.\nIf Customer is located in a jurisdiction which requires Customer to deduct or withhold Taxes or other amounts from any amounts due to us, please notify us, in writing, promptly and we shall join efforts to avoid any such Tax withholding, provided, however, that in any case, Customer shall bear the sole responsibility and liability to pay such Tax and such Tax should be deemed as being added on top of the Subscription Fees, payable by Customer.<br>\n9.5.\nSubscription Upgrade.\nDuring the Subscription Term, Customer may upgrade its Subscription Plan by either: (i) adding Authorized Users.\n(ii) upgrading to a higher type of Subscription Plan.\n(iii) adding add-on features and functionalities.\nand/or (iv) upgrading to a longer Subscription Term (collectively, \u201cSubscription Upgrades\u201d).\nSome Subscription Upgrades or other changes may be considered as a new purchase, hence will restart the Subscription Term and some won't, as indicated within the Service and/or the Order Form.\nUpon a Subscription Upgrade, Customer will be billed for the applicable increased amount of Subscription Fees, at our then-current rates (unless indicated otherwise in an Order Form), either: (1) prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term, or (2) whenever the Subscription Term is being restarted due to the Subscription

restrictions as for the upload, storage, download and use of the Service.<br>\n9.8.\nBilling.\nAs part of registering, or submitting billing information, to the Service, Customer agrees to provide us with updated, accurate and complete billing information, and Customer authorizes us (either directly or through our affiliates, subsidiaries or other third parties) to charge, request and collect payment (or otherwise charge, refund or take any other billing actions) from Customer's payment method or designated banking account, and to make any inquiries that we may consider necessary to validate Customer's designated payment account or financial information, in order to ensure prompt payment, including for the purpose of receiving updated payment details from Customer's credit card company or banking account (e.g., updated expiry date or card number as may be provided to us by Customer's credit card company).<br>\n9.9.\nSubscription Auto-Renewal.\nIn order to ensure that Customer will not experience any interruption or loss of services, Customer's Subscription includes an automatic renewal option by default, according to which, the Subscription will automatically renew upon the end of the then applicable Subscription Term, for a renewal period equal in time to the original Subscription Term (excluding extended periods) and, unless otherwise notified to Customer, at the same price (subject to applicable Tax changes and excluding any discount or other promotional offer provided for the first Subscription Term).\nAccordingly, unless either Customer or us cancel the Subscription prior to its expiration, we will attempt to automatically charge Customer the applicable Subscription Fees upon or immediately prior to the expiration of the then applicable Subscription Term.\nIf Customer wishes to avoid such auto-renewal, Customer shall cancel its Subscription, prior to its expiration, at any time through the Account settings or by contacting our us.\nExcept as expressly set forth in these Terms, in case a Customer cancels its Subscription, during a Subscription Term, the Subscription will not renew for an additional period, but Customer will not be refunded or credited for any unused period within the Subscription Term.<br>\n9.10.\nDiscounts and Promotions.\nUnless expressly stated otherwise in a separate legally binding agreement, if

Account (\u201cChargeback\u201d), this will be considered as a breach of Customer's payment obligations hereunder, and Customer's use of the Service may be disabled or terminated and such use of the Service will not resume until Customer re-subscribes for any such Service, and pay any applicable Subscription Fees in full, including any fees and expenses incurred by us and/or any Third Party
