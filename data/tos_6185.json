enter free-form text through which the Child User could enter Personal information that would be visible to other Users.\nThis may occur, for example, when a child names his or her word list, or enters his or her notes or sentence examples on a word list.\nIf you are a parent, please advise your child about the risks of posting Personal Information on Vocabulary.com (or any other online service).</p>\n<p>If you are a parent, and you agree to let your child use Vocabulary.com, you agree and acknowledge that you permit your child to use Vocabulary.com and all features made available on
