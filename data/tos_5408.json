date of posting and apply to Orders and Pre-orders placed on and after that date.</p>\nOrder Acceptance\n<p>Framework reserves the right to change prices for Products at any time and without notice, and to correct errors in pricing that may occur.&nbsp.\nDepending on your shipping location, the purchase price may not include shipping, import duties, taxes, transfer fees, and other governmental charges, which are the Customer\u2019s responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When placing an Order for a Product, you will be required to provide certain information, such as your address and other billing information.\nYou represent and warrant that all such information is accurate, and you will ensure that such information is kept current.</p>\n<p>The Product will be delivered to the delivery address specified in \u201cShipping Information\u201d in the checkout process or provided through other payment profiles, such as PayPal.\nYou are responsible for providing the correct address in the ordering process.\nFramework has no responsibility or liability for inaccurate information or information that later becomes outdated and has no obligation to make efforts to determine the correct contact or shipping information.&nbsp.\nFramework is not liable for any loss resulting from failure to provide the correct delivery address.</p>\n<p>The Product will be shipped to you in accordance with the shipping option chosen by you in the ordering process.\nThe cost of shipping is detailed in the order process.\nThe estimated dispatch and delivery date will be stated in the order process.</p>\n<p>The delivery date will depend on the selected shipping option and delivery location, as well as the time of payment.\nChanges and/or delays to the estimated dispatch and delivery date may occur.\nFramework will notify you of any changes impacting the delivery of your ordered Product.\nFramework is not liable for delays in the estimated delivery date for the Order.</p>\n<p>Orders and Pre-orders may be subject to order quantity limits, which will be shown during the checkout process.</p>\n<p>Framework reserves the right to decline, reject, or cancel your order or limit order quantity at any time.&nbsp.\nThis may be for reasons which include but are not limited to product availability, quantity limits, errors in stated price, invalid or unsupported shipment addresses, or payment processing issues.&nbsp.\nIf you have already paid, we will refund you the full amount of the declined, rejected, or cancelled order or the amount of adjusted order quantity, including applicable taxes and any delivery charges.&nbsp.\nFramework may contact you using the contact information we have for your account (the \u201cContact Information\u201d) to adjust your order, payment method, or shipment information to resolve the issue prior to cancellation.</p>\nOrder Cancellation\n<p>Once you have placed an Order, Framework strives to deliver in a timely manner.&nbsp.\nPrior to Order shipment, you may request cancellation of the Order by contacting Framework Support.\nFramework will send a confirmation email to the email you provided if the cancellation was successful.\nIf the cancellation is confirmed by Framework, you are entitled to a full refund of purchase price.\nFramework strives to process refunds within a reasonable amount of time.</p>\nPre-orders\n<p>Each Pre-order you submit for a Product acts as a deposit for a future purchase of the Product.&nbsp.\nYou will be charged a Pre-order deposit, plus any applicable taxes, at the time of placing the Pre-order for Product.&nbsp.\nThe remainder of the specified purchase price, plus any applicable taxes, duties, shipping and other costs, will be charged before the Product is released for shipment.</p>\n<p>We will attempt to charge the remainder of the purchase price and other costs to your payment method on file when your Product is ready to ship.&nbsp.\nIf we are unable to process the payment, we will attempt to contact you via your Contact Information.&nbsp.\nIf you do not complete your Order by updating your payment method and paying the full remainder due within 30 days, Framework may, at its sole discretion, provide you a full refund of the deposit, or continue to attempt to contact you via your Contact Information.\nFramework will make reasonable efforts to contact you to provide a refund after that 30-day period, but if Framework does not receive a response from you within 90 days of our initial request to complete your Order, or if Framework is not able to process your refund after that 30-day period (for example, due to a cancelled credit card), then Framework will treat the amount that you paid as unclaimed property in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<p>Although we will make efforts to begin delivering Products as soon as reasonably practicable, you understand and agree that there may be delays.\nIn the event that a delay arises and the estimated shipment date is not met, Framework is not responsible for any damages that may occur due to the delay, nor is it obligated to provide any discounts, refunds or credits due to any such delays.\nWe will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with updates via your Contact Information with respect to the delivery schedule.\nIf for any reason you decide that you do not wish to continue to wait for your Product, you may cancel your Pre-order by contacting Framework Support.</p>\n<p>Either you or Framework may cancel your Pre-order at any time for any or no reason prior to our notice to you that your Product is ready for delivery.\nIf you do so prior to completing the Product purchase by making the second payment, Framework will refund your Pre-order deposit without interest.\nIf Framework cancels your Pre-order, we will refund your Pre-order deposit without interest.&nbsp.\nOnce you complete the Product purchase by making the second payment, Framework\u2019s standard Order Cancellation, Return, and Limited Warranty Policies will apply.</p>\nGeographic Availability\n<p>Products will only be shipped to supported shipping regions.&nbsp.\nAvailable Products may vary depending on your region.&nbsp.\nDuring checkout, your shipping address will be validated to determine if it is in a supported shipping region for the Product.&nbsp.\nIf the final shipping address is outside of these regions, Framework reserves the right to cancel the Order and refund any amount actually paid.</p>\nReturn Policy\n<p>Framework will accept returns and exchanges for eligible Products for up to 30 days after the date of shipment or download, as applicable.\nBefore returning a Product, you must contact Framework Support to initiate the return process.&nbsp.\nYou

included.</p>\n<p>If Framework does not receive the returned Product as instructed or the Product is worn, damaged, or missing items, Framework may deduct a reprocessing fee or otherwise reduce the amount of the refund.</p>\n<p>Even if you return your Products, these Terms of Sale will still apply to the time between your purchase or download, as applicable, and return.</p>\n<p>Some items are not eligible for return or refund, and will be noted as such at time of order.\nunless otherwise provided by law or by a particular product offer, all purchases of these ineligible products are final and non-refundable.</p>\n<p>When you make a qualifying return, we will credit the full amount, less the original and return shipping and any reprocessing fees, and you will typically receive your refund within 10 business days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Any refunds will be applied to the same account, and using the same method of payment used to place the Order unless you choose a credit through Framework\u2019s web store in the amount of the refund.</p>\n<p>For complete details on how to return eligible products, see our Returns and Refunds page.</p>\nUse of the Product and

to achieve the purposes described below.\nSuch technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User\u2019s device as they interact with this Website.\n</p>\n<p> For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as \"Trackers\" within this document \u2013 unless there is a reason to differentiate.<br> For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker.\nFor this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.\n</p>\n<p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent.\nWhenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>\n<p>This Website uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called \u201cfirst-party\u201d Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called \u201cthird-party\u201d Trackers).\nUnless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.<br>\nThe validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider.\nSome of them expire upon termination of the User\u2019s browsing session.<br>\nIn addition to what\u2019s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information \u2013 such as the presence of other Trackers - in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.</p>\n<p> To find more information dedicated to Californian

deliver personalized marketing content based on User behavior and to operate, serve and track ads.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Remarketing and behavioral targeting <p>This type of service allows this Website and its partners to inform, optimize and serve advertising based on past use of this Website by the User.<br>\nThis activity is facilitated by tracking Usage Data and by using Trackers to collect information which is then transferred to the partners that manage the remarketing and behavioral targeting activity.<br>\nSome services offer a remarketing option based on email address lists.<br>\nIn addition to any opt-out feature provided by any of the services below, Users may opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Users may also opt-out of

withdraw consent, where relevant:</p>\n<p>Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences widget, if available.</p>\n<p>It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the User\u2019s initial consent.</p>\n<p>Other Trackers in the browser\u2019s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.</p>\n<p>With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences and withdraw their consent via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.</p> Locating Tracker Settings\n<p>Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>\n<li>Apple Safari</li>\n<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>\n<li>Microsoft Edge</li>\n<li>Brave</li>\n<li>Opera</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).</p> How to opt out of interest-based advertising <p>Notwithstanding the above, Users may follow the instructions provided by YourOnlineChoices (EU), the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (US), DAAC (Canada), DDAI (Japan) or other similar services.\nSuch initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools.\nThe Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application called AppChoices that helps Users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.\n</p> Owner and Data Controller <p>Framework Computer Inc\n<br>1870 Ogden Drive\n<br>Burlingame CA\n<br>94010</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Owner contact email:</strong>

withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>\n<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the \u201cdefinitions\u201d section of this document.\nUsers are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.\nIn order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>\n<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Regarding the purchase of goods,</strong> the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day on which the User or a third party \u2013 other than the carrier and designated by the User \u2013 takes physical possession of the goods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Regarding the purchase of several goods ordered together</strong> but delivered separately or in

be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>\n<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User\u2019s decision to withdraw from the contract.\nUnless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.\nIn any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>\n\u2026on the purchase of physical goods\n<p>Unless the Owner has offered to collect the goods, Users shall send back the goods or hand them over to the Owner, or to a person authorized by the latter to receive the goods, without undue delay and in any event within 14 days from the day on which they communicated their decision to withdraw from the contract.</p>\n<p>The deadline is met if the goods are handed to the carrier, or otherwise returned as indicated above, before the expiration of the 14-days-period for returning the goods.\nThe reimbursement may be withheld until reception of the goods, or until Users have supplied evidence of having returned the goods, whichever is the earliest.</p>\n<p>Users shall only be liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling of the goods outside of that which is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics and functioning.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The costs of returning the goods are borne by the User</strong>.</p> Legal guarantee of conformity for goods\n<p>Under EU law, for a minimum period of 2 years after delivery, traders guarantee the conformity of the goods they sell.\nThis means that traders must ensure that the goods purchased have the promised quality, or the quality that can be reasonably expected, functionality or characteristics for at least two years after they\u2019ve been delivered to the purchaser.</p>\n<p>Where Users qualify as European Consumers, the legal guarantee of conformity for goods applies to the items available on this Website in accordance with the laws of the country of their habitual residence.</p>\n<p>National laws of such country may grant such Users broader rights.</p>\n<p>Consumers who do not qualify as European may benefit from legal guarantee of conformity
