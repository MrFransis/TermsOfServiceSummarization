rather than in court</strong>, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by any appropriate arbitration forum including, but not limited to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or JAMS, under their rules, including any Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nJAMS rules are available at WWW.JAMSADR.COM or by calling (800) 352-5267.&nbsp;Payment of all filing,

arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</strong>&nbsp;If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration&nbsp;<strong>we each waive any right to a jury trial</strong>.\nWe also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.&nbsp;ENFORCEMENT:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;MCM wishes to maintain the MCM Website and the MCM App

prosecution, including, without limitation, punishment under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 under U.S.\nfederal law.\nYou shall therefore not, nor shall you permit any third party to, disable, circumvent, or otherwise avoid any security device, mechanism, protocol, or procedure established by MCM for use of or with the MCM Website or the MCM App.\nMoreover, you also acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this TOU by you may cause irreparable injury to MCM and/or its licensors, such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and MCM and/or its licensors would not have an adequate remedy at law.\nYou therefore agree that MCM and/or its licensors (or on their behalf) shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of your obligations under any provision of this TOU.\nAccordingly, you hereby waive any requirement that MCM or its licensors post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to MCM to enforce any provision of this TOU.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.&nbsp;TERMINATION:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;MCM also reserves the right at any time and on reasonable grounds, which shall include, without limitation, any reasonable belief of fraud, illegal activity, or actions or omissions that violate any term or condition of this TOU, to terminate this TOU with you (including any registered account) and your right to access and use the MCM Website and/or the MCM App.\nYou acknowledge and agree that MCM shall have the sole right to determine in its reasonable discretion whether you are engaging in any unauthorized activity and/or violating any term or conditions of this TOU.\nMCM shall also not be responsible or liable for any damages or loss, such as loss of sales or profits, as a result of any termination of this TOU in accordance with this section.\nYou may also terminate at any time by ceasing to use the MCM Website and/or the MCM App.\nBut, all applicable provisions of this TOU will survive termination, as outlined below.\nAny licenses from MCM and any right to use the MCM Website and/or the MCM App shall immediately cease upon termination of this TOU.\nThe provisions concerning feedback, MCM's ownership rights, warranty disclaimer, limitation of liability, governing law, enforcement, termination, and the miscellaneous terms will survive the termination or expiration of this TOU for any reason.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.&nbsp;GOVERNING LAW:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This TOU has been made in and will be construed and enforced solely in accordance with the laws of the State of

action is barred.\nIn addition, you agree to waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to this TOU and that each party has the right to seek attorney's fees in any proceeding.\nYou also acknowledge and agree that any applicable state law implementation of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (including any available remedies or laws) shall not apply to this TOU and is hereby disclaimed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.&nbsp;SPECIFIC PROGRAMS.\nOTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional notices, terms, and conditions, including, without limitation, MCM\u2019s Web Privacy Policy, and MCM's Privacy Notice, may apply to the use of the platforms or online solutions available through the MCM Website and/or the MCM App.\nYou agree to abide by such other notices, terms, and conditions (as applicable).\nIf there is a conflict with this Agreement, MCM's obligations, if any, with respect to its services, programs, and/or products are governed solely by the terms, conditions, notices, and agreements pursuant to which they are provided, and nothing should be construed to alter such terms, conditions, notices, and agreements.\nNevertheless, your end use of the MCM Website and the MCM App shall be pursuant to this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.&nbsp;ENGLISH VERSION PREVAILS:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event this TOU is translated into other languages and there is a discrepancy between the two language versions, the English language version shall prevail.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>21.&nbsp;MISCELLANEOUS:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The relationship between you and MCM is and shall be that of independent contractors and nothing in this TOU shall be construed or used to create or imply any relationship of partners, joint ventures, or employer and employee.\nYou may not assign or otherwise transfer this TOU or the license granted hereunder or delegate any of your duties specified herein, in whole or in part, without MCM's prior written consent.\nAny attempt of assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of this TOU shall be void, of no effect, and a material breach of this TOU.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, MCM may assign this TOU in whole or in part.\nMoreover, MCM may delegate its rights and responsibilities or use contractors or agents to fulfill its obligations under this TOU.\nFailure by MCM to insist on strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this TOU will not operate as a waiver of that or any subsequent default or failure of performance.\nIn the event any provision of this TOU is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, you agree that unless it materially affects the entire intent and purpose of this TOU, the invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall affect neither the validity of this TOU nor the remaining provisions herein, and the provision in question shall be deemed to be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision most closely reflecting the intent and purpose of the original provision.\nHeadings are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nThis TOU and MCM's Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth fully herein, represent the entire agreement between you and MCM with respect to subject matter herein, and they supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written between you and MCM with respect to the MCM Website and/or the MCM App.\nPlease note that MCM reserves the right to change the terms and conditions of this TOU and by which the MCM Website and/or the MCM App are extended to you by providing notice of such changes on this webpage or providing in writing or electronically a copy of such revised terms (or notice thereof).\nMCM also has the exclusive right to provide updates, upgrades, and/or changes to
