&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<ul>\n<li>Global policy</li>\n<li>California policy</li>\n</ul>Summary of our Privacy Policy<p>This is a summary of our new privacy policy which takes effect on May 25th, 2018.\nIt covers every Zoho website that links here, and all of the products and services contained on those websites.\nThe detailed policy follows the same structure as this summary and constitutes the actual legal document.</p>\n<p>Our privacy commitment: Zoho has never sold your information to someone else for advertising, or made money by showing you other people's ads, and we never will.\nThis has been our approach for almost 20 years, and we remain committed to it.\nThis policy tells you what information we do collect from you, what we do with it, who can access it, and what you can do about it.</p>Part I \u2013 Information Zoho collects and controls<p>We only collect the information that we actually need.\nSome of that is information that you actively give us when you sign up for an account, register for an event, ask for customer support, or buy something from us.\nWe store your name and contact information, but we don't store credit card numbers (except with your permission and in one of our secured payment gateways).</p>\n<p>When you visit one of our websites or use our software, we automatically log some basic information like how you got to the site, where you navigated within it, and what features and settings you use.\nWe use this information to improve our websites and services and to drive new product development.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we receive information indirectly.\nIf you ask about our products through one of our referral programs or reselling partners, or sign in to one of our products through an authentication service provider like LinkedIn or Google, they'll pass on your contact information to us.\nWe'll use that information to complete the request that you made.\nIf you engage with our brand on social media (for instance, liking, commenting, retweeting, mentioning, or following us), we'll have access to your interactions and profile information.\nWe'll still have that information even if you later remove it from the social media site.</p>What we do with your information<p>We use your information to provide the services you've requested, create and maintain your accounts, and keep an eye out for unauthorized activity on your accounts.\nWe also use it to communicate with you about the products you're currently using, your customer support requests, new products you may like, chances for you to give us feedback, and policy updates.\nWe analyze the information we collect to understand user needs and to improve our websites and services.</p>\n<p>We're required to have a legal basis for collecting and processing your information.\nIn most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us.\nWhen that's not the case, we must demonstrate that we have another legal basis, such as our legitimate business interests.</p>\n<p>You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later.\nYou can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly.\nWe completely disable third-party cookies from all Zoho websites and products.</p>\n<p>We limit access to your personal information to our employees and contractors who have a legitimate need to use it.\nIf we share your information with other parties (like developers, service providers, domain registrars, and reselling partners), they must have appropriate security measures and a valid reason for using your information, typically to serve you.</p>\n<p>The European Economic Area (EEA) provides certain rights to data subjects (including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object and to complain).\nZoho undertakes to provide you the same rights no matter where you choose to live.</p>\n<p>We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.\nWhen we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.</p>Part II \u2013 Information that Zoho processes on your behalf<p>If you handle other people's data using Zoho apps, such as information about your customers or employees, you are entrusting that data to us for processing.\nIf you use a Zoho mobile app and give the app access to your contacts and photo library, you are entrusting data to us.\nThe data you entrust to us for processing is called service data.</p>\n<p>You own your service data.\nWe protect it, limit access to it, and only process it according to your instructions.\nYou may access it, share it through third-party integrations, and request that we export or delete it.</p>\n<p>We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use Zoho Services.\nAfter you terminate your account, your data will be automatically deleted from our active database within 6 months and from our backups within 3 months after that.</p>\n<p>If you are in the European Economic Area and you believe that someone has entrusted your information to us for processing (for instance, your employer or a company whose services you use), you can request certain actions from us regarding your data.\nTo exercise those data rights, please contact the person or company that entrusted the data to us and we will work with them on your request.</p>Part III \u2013 General<p>There are some limitations to the privacy we can promise you.\nWe will disclose personal information if it's necessary to comply with a legal obligation, prevent fraud, enforce an agreement, or protect our users' safety.\nWe do not currently honor Do Not Track signals from internet browsers.\nwhen a universal standard for processing them emerges, we will follow it.</p>\n<p>Third-party websites and social media widgets have their own separate privacy policies.\nAlways check the relevant privacy policy before sharing personal information with third parties.</p>\n<p>You can always contact us to: ask questions about our privacy practices, request a GDPR-compliant Data Processing Addendum, alert us if you believe we have collected personal data from a minor, or ask to have your personal information removed from our blogs or forums.\nYou can also check our Security Policy and Privacy Policy </p>\n<p>We will contact you to let you know if we make any major changes to our privacy policy, or in the highly unlikely event that we ever decide to sell our business.</p>Privacy Policy<p>This Privacy Policy statement is made by the Zoho Group consisting of all the entities listed here (collectively, \"Zoho\", \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\") and is effective as of 25th May 2018.\nIt applies to all our divisions: Zoho, ManageEngine, Site24x7, and WebNMS.</p>Zoho\u2019s Privacy Commitment<p>Zoho has worried about customer and user privacy for almost 20 years, long before it became fashionable, politically correct, or legally binding to take such a position.\nWe ask for only the least amount of information necessary, gathering only what we believe is essential for doing business, or for the specific transaction at hand.\nWe let customers know the information we have on them and allow them to opt out of specific engagements.\nBut, by far, our biggest commitment is that we do not make a single dollar from advertising revenue\u2014never have, never will\u2014even from the free editions of our products.\nThis means we avoid the fundamental conflict of interest between gathering customer information and fueling advertising revenue, and the unavoidable compromises in customer privacy that it brings.</p>\n<p>The goal of this policy is to make explicit the information we gather on our customers and users, how we will use it, and how we will not.\nThis policy is unfortunately longer than we would like, but we must unambiguously address all the relevant cases.\nWe will try and keep the language simple and direct as much as possible.</p>Scope of this Privacy Policy<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all Zoho websites that link to it.\nIt also applies to the products and services provided by Zoho through these websites, our mobile applications, and applications posted by Zoho on Zoho\u2019s online marketplace and in other third-party online marketplaces.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our websites, products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy is divided into three parts:</p>Part I \u2013 Information Zoho collects and controls<p>This part deals with how Zoho collects and uses information about website visitors, potential customers, users of Zoho's products and services, and others who contact Zoho through forms or email addresses published on or linked to our websites.</p>Part II \u2013 Information that Zoho processes on your behalf<p>This part deals with how Zoho handles data that you entrust to Zoho when you use our products and services, or when you share any personal or confidential information with us while requesting customer support.</p>Part III \u2013 General<p>This part deals with topics that are relevant to both Parts I and II, and other general topics such as Zoho's security commitments and how we will inform you when we change this Privacy Policy.</p>Part I \u2013 Information Zoho collects and controlsWhat information Zoho collects<p>We collect information about you only if we need the information for some legitimate purpose.\nZoho will have information about you only if (a) you have provided the information yourself, (b) Zoho has automatically collected the information, or (c) Zoho has obtained the information from a third party.\nBelow we describe the various scenarios that fall under each of those three categories and the information collected in each one.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Information that you provide us</u>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>i.\n<i> Account signup </i>\n</strong>: When you sign up for an account to access one or more of our services, we ask for

accessing the created account.\nYou may also provide us with more information such as your photo, time zone and language, but we don\u2019t require that information to sign up for an account.\nAfter signing up, you will have the option of choosing a security question and an answer to the security question \u2014 if you provide these, they will be used only while resetting your password.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ii.\n<i> Event registrations and other form submissions: </i>\n</strong> We record information that you submit when you (i) register for any event, including webinars or

cardholder, the expiry date and the last four digits of the credit card number.\nWe do not store the actual credit card number.\nFor quick processing of future payments, if you have given us your approval, we may store your credit card information or other payment information in an encrypted format in the secured servers of our Payment Gateway Service Providers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>iv.\n<i>Testimonials </i>\n</strong>: When you authorize us to post testimonials about our products and services on websites, we may include your name and other personal information in the testimonial.\nYou will be given an opportunity to review and approve the testimonial before we post it.\nIf you wish to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at privacy@zohocorp.com </p>\n<p>\n<strong>v.\n<i>Interactions with Zoho </i>\n</strong>: We may record, analyze and use your interactions with us, including email, telephone, and chat conversations with

Products</li>\n</ul>Anti Spam Policy<p>This policy is applicable to all Zoho Services that may be used for transmitting bulk emails or commercial emails (\u201cCovered Services\u201d).</p>\n<p>You agree to Zoho Anti-Spam Policy as a precondition to use of Covered Services.\nCovered Services may be used only for sending mails or messages to persons from whom you have an express permission to send mails or messages on the subject of such mail or message, such as permission-based email marketing.\nWe are very serious about our Anti-Spam Policy.\nIf we discover that you are sending emails or messages to people without their permission, we reserve the right to terminate your user account.</p>\n<p>Last Updated on: 4th September 2009</p>\n<p>By \u201cpermission\u201d we mean express and provable permission granted to you.\nA permission to send commercial emails may be through:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp.\nSubmission of email address as part of downloading anything from your website or ordering a product or service from you.</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\nSubscription to an email newsletter by filling a form on your website.</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\nSomeone has provided you with the email address as part of participation in any contest, event or survey conducted by you and you have informed him/her that you would be sending them marketing emails.</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\nAny instance where a person completing a form has checked an opt-in checkbox indicating their willingness to be contacted by you through email, provided the checkbox is unchecked by default and you have informed such person that the nature of the emails will be commercial.</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\nAny business card given by a person who has expressed his/her willingness to receive emails of a commercial nature.\nWillingness to receive emails of a commercial nature will be presumed where the business card was dropped in your booth at a tradeshow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rule of thumb is \u201cDo not use Covered Services to send mails or messages to email addresses to which you do not have express permission to send emails on the subject of the email.\u201d We insist on 100% compliance with the above rule.</p>\n<p>When we say 100%, we do not include those instances where the recipient of an email has marked it as Spam although you have an express provable permission to send emails to that email address.\nIt should be borne in mind that a permission once granted is deemed to have been revoked if the recipient of a mail has opted out of receiving emails from you.</p>\n<p>In particular, you shall strictly comply with the following rules, which clarify the Rule of Thumb mentioned above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp.\nYou should have explicit permission to contact the recipient on the subject of your email.\nYou shall maintain sufficient proof of the fact that you have received permission from all recipients of emails sent by you through Covered Services.</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\nYou shall not import or send emails to email addresses that you have bought, loaned, rented or in any way acquired from a third party, irrespective of any claim about quality or permission, while using Covered Services.\nYou shall also refrain from importing into your Covered Services account or sending mails to email addresses you have collected from other websites.</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\nYou shall ensure that the routing and header information including your emails \u201cFrom\u201d and \u201cTo,\u201d the originating domain name and email address are true and accurate.</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\nYou shall not use subject lines that mislead the recipient about the contents or subject matter of the message.</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\nYou shall provide a one-click unsubscribe option in all emails and refrain from sending emails to persons who have opted out or un-subscribed from your mailing list.\nThe request to opt-out from the mailing list should be honored within 10 days from the date of request.</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\nYou shall include your valid physical postal address in all emails sent through Covered Services.</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\nYou shall include a conspicuous notice in all marketing emails that the message is an advertisement or solicitation and that the recipient can opt out of receiving more commercial emails from you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may, at any time, require you to prove that you have express permission to send emails to email addresses you have imported to your Covered Services irrespective of whether you have sent marketing emails to such email addresses.</p>\n<p>Your use of Covered Services signifies your unconditional acceptance of this Anti-Spam Policy.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about our Anti-Spam Policy, or if you want to report spamming activity by one of our customers, please contact our
