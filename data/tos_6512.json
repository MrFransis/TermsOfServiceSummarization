sent.\nHowever, if You do not accept Cookies, You may not be able to use some parts of Our Service.\nUnless You have adjusted Your browser setting so that it will refuse Cookies, Our Service may use Cookies.\n</li>\n<li>Cookies can be \"Persistent\" or \"Session\" Cookies.\nPersistent Cookies remain on Your personal computer or mobile device Device when You go offline, while Session Cookies are

</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Necessary / Essential Cookies </li>\n<li>Type: Session Cookies </li>\n<li>Administered by: Us </li>\n<li>Purpose: These Cookies are essential to provide You with the Services available through the Website and to enable You to use some of its features.\nWe only use these Cookies to track Your guesses within a particular game.\nWithout these Cookies, the Service that You have asked for cannot be provided, and We only use these Cookies to provide You with the Service.\n</li>\n<li>More Information: Put simply, We don't want to store Your information or track You.\nHowever, We do want to generate nice looking graphs to see how people are playing the game and that's why We record at least some metadata (date and time of guesses, your answers, your IP address [temporarily] and your browser user-agent).\nNone of it can be tracked back to Yourselves, and even the IP address We initially take is put through a geolocation service and immediately discarded.\nThe User Agent of Your browser is stored against the initial guess, but again this is only used to get a rough idea of the Devices people are using to access Blurdle.\nThere has been a lot of talk in the past about fingerprinting people through their User Agent, but We're not doing that.\nWe don't care who You are (in a nice way!), We're just looking to make the game as accessible and fun as possible.\nWe also want to be able to give You nice features such as the Stats page, and to do that We need to record some information.\nIf You're ok with that, and You understand Our promise not to \"harvest\" Your data, then We'll keep developing Blurdle for You.\n</li>\n</ul> Links to Other Websites <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us.\nIf You click on a third-party link, You will be directed to that third-party's site.\nWe strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.</p>\n<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p> Changes to this Privacy Policy <p>We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time.\nWe will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>\n<p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p> Change Log <ul>\n<li>2022-04-11: Initial Policy </li>\n<li>2022-04-17: Addition of 'More Information' under the Session Cookies section explaining what data we collect and
