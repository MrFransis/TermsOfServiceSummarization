who receives the delivery is conclusively presumed to be authorized to receive the delivery.\nIn cases in which you have designated an alternative receiver, such person shall accept the products under

present at the time of delivery at the address supplied during ordering.\n(iii) decreased product quality due to an incorrect delivery address supplied during ordering, or a re-route requested by the recipient.\n(iv) product quality problems caused by improper handling by the recipient.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There may be some instances, as a result of inclement weather, natural or national disaster, or other unforeseen circumstances, that your delivery cannot be made on your assigned delivery day.&nbsp.\nIn those cases, we will make our best effort to deliver your order as close as possible to the assigned delivery day.&nbsp.\nIn the case that we cannot deliver your box at all, we will notify you and credit your account for the missed delivery if necessary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From time to time, Imperfect may offer pick-up sites.\nFor any customers who are assigned to a pick-up site: &nbsp;Any orders not picked up during the time window of

discretion, as it sees fit.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>Section 5 \u2013 Product Descriptions<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Imperfect attempts to be as accurate as possible with all of our product descriptions.\n&nbsp;However, Imperfect does not warrant that product descriptions, photos, or other content of any product is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.\nThe products delivered may vary from the images and descriptions viewed on the site due to a number of factors that are not within our control, including without limitation, system capabilities and constraints of your computer, manufacturing process issues, and the availability and variability of product, packaging, and raw materials.\nAlthough we will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to help ensure that the products conform to reasonable expectations, variations may sometimes occur.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;If a product offered by Imperfect itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to receive a credit or refund for the product.\nWe are specifically working with produce items that are misshapen and sometimes mis-colored \u2013 nature doesn\u2019t grow perfect produce all the time.\nFor this reason, weights displayed are approximate and intended to communicate approximate amounts of produce that you will receive.\nWhile we don\u2019t anticipate weights to be incorrect, your sole remedy for any error or documented weight-related issue will be resolved via a credit or refund for the product in question.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>Section 6 \u2013 Returns, Replacements, Credits, and Refunds<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are dissatisfied with any product, please reach out to our Customer Care team.\nTo reach out, submit a completed form on our Contact page and a Customer Care Associate will respond to your query and, depending on the circumstances, we will provide you a replacement, a full or partial refund of the purchase price for that box or product, or a full or partial credit of the purchase price for that box or product.\nWe may require the return or photographic documentation of any product with which you are dissatisfied before we provide you a replacement, credit, or refund.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Imperfect reserves the right to refuse service, refuse distribution of credits or refunds, terminate accounts, terminate your rights to use Imperfect, or cancel orders in its sole discretion.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Once processed, please allow the refund amount to appear in your account after 5-10 business days.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Section 6.1 - Credits<p>\n</p>\n<p>Credits given may be for an item\u2019s full or partial purchase price, for a delivery fee, or for some other amount determined by Imperfect in its discretion.\n&nbsp;Imperfect may occasionally provide you with Credits to thank you for your patience with a delayed delivery or to address a customer service issue.\nThe issuance of such Credits and any Credit amounts are determined at the sole discretion of Imperfect.\nImperfect may occasionally provide promotions, offers, and other communications, and Credits may be earned through these special offers communicated to you by Imperfect or its agents (each an \u201cOffer\u201d).\n&nbsp;Once you meet the criteria described in any Offer, you are eligible for the advertised Credits, under these Terms and any additional terms and conditions of each Offer.\nIf there is a conflict between these Terms and the terms and conditions of any Offer, the Offer terms and conditions will control.\n&nbsp;Offers are not transferable.\nOffers may not be made available to all users.\n</p>\n<p>Unless communicated to you otherwise by Imperfect, all Credits are automatically applied to your next Order.\nCertain Credits may not automatically be applied to your next Order and will require additional action on your part (e.g., application of a coupon code) in order to be applied to future purchases, which further requirements for applying Credits shall be communicated to you at the time of Credit issuance.\n&nbsp;Credits may not be applied to and/or redeemed for gift cards, gift subscriptions, taxes, fees, and for certain product and/or service categories as determined by Imperfect in its sole discretion.\n</p>\n<p>Credits can be applied for up to twelve months after date of issuance and thereafter, Credits will automatically expire.\n&nbsp;Credits will expire if your account is inactive (not accepting delivery of an order during a five (5) month period), if you cancel your recurring subscription, or if your account is closed, and all unredeemed Credits at such time will be forfeited immediately and may not be reinstated.</p>\n<p>All Credits are promotional in nature, are not transferable, and are not redeemable for cash or other property.\n&nbsp;Credits may not be applied toward payment of any outstanding account balances or previous purchases.\nOnce a Credit is redeemed, it will not be refundable or reinstated for any reason, including without limitation in connection with returned or exchanged purchases that were made with Credits.</p>\n<p>Credits are displayed in the Billing History section of the Billing Details page within your Account.\n&nbsp;A valid account is required to check Credits.\n&nbsp;If any Credits are believed to have been sold, exchanged, or obtained fraudulently, those Credits will be void and will not be honored.\n&nbsp;At any time and in Imperfect\u2019s sole discretion (including where a user was not eligible to earn certain Credits according to these Terms), Imperfect may correct the amount of Credits shown as credited to an Account.\n</p>\n<p> If for some reason you believe that there is a discrepancy regarding your Credit balance, please submit a request on the Contact page and a Customer Care Associate will respond to your query.\nAll decisions regarding your Credit balance will be determined in our sole discretion and are final.\n</p>\n<p>Imperfect may change the Credits program, associated Credits, and these Terms at any time, for any reason and without notice.\nImperfect may make changes that affect, without limitation, processes, benefits, levels, and rules for receiving and using Credits, availability of Credits, Credit types, availability of Offers, and any other related benefits.\n&nbsp;Imperfect may terminate the Credits program with one month\u2019s advance notice to active users.\nIf the Credits program is terminated, upon termination, all unredeemed Credits will be forfeited without any obligation or liability, and Credits claims will no longer be honored.\nImperfect may terminate the Credits program in whole or in part, in any jurisdiction, on less than one month's notice if required to do so by applicable law, as determined by Imperfect in its reasonable discretion.\n&nbsp;All Credits program benefits, offers, and services are subject to availability and may be changed at any time without notice.\n</p>\n<p>Credits awarded by our Referral Program are also governed by our additional Referral Program Terms and Conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>Section 7 - Cancellation Policy<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Important: when you sign up for a recurring subscription, orders will automatically be generated in your cart according to the weekly delivery schedule assigned to

17 - Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.\nClass Action Waiver<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please Read This Provision Carefully.\n&nbsp;It Affects Your Legal Rights.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.\nClass Action Waiver provision (this \u201cProvision\u201d) facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (e.g., claim or controversy, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort \u2013 including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence \u2013 or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that may arise between you and Imperfect.\n&nbsp;Effectively, then, \u201cdispute\u201d is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>\n<p>This Provision provides that all disputes between you and us shall be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.\n&nbsp;To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nThe arbitrator must follow this Provision and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney\u2019s fees).\nYou may, however, opt-out of this Provision which means you would have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).\nBoth you and Imperfect agree that, except as provided below, any and all disputes, as defined above, whether presently in existence or based on acts or omissions in the past or in the future, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration rather than in court in accordance with this provision.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For all disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the dispute which is first done by submitting a completed form on our Contact page with the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.\nIf we do not resolve the dispute within 45 days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your dispute in arbitration.\n&nbsp;You may pursue your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or we may choose to pursue a dispute in court and not by arbitration if: (a) The dispute qualifies for initiation in small claims court.\nor (b) You opt-out of these arbitration procedures within 30 days from the date that you first consent to these terms (the \u201cOpt-Out Deadline\u201d).\n&nbsp;You may opt-out of this Provision by submitting a completed form on our Contact page with the following information: (1) your name.\n(2) your address.\n(3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration.\nEither way, we will not take any decision you make personally.\n&nbsp;In fact, we promise that your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with us.\nBut, we do have to enforce the Opt-Out Deadline so keep in mind that <strong>any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If this Provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate arbitration proceedings.\n&nbsp;The American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.\n&nbsp;The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.\nAll issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.</p>\n<p>For arbitration before AAA, for disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.\nfor disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.\n&nbsp;In either instance, the AAA\u2019s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.\nThe AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nFor arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.\n&nbsp;The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.\nThis Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.\nUnder no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>\n<p>Because the Sites and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the arbitrability of all disputes.\n&nbsp;However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Award</em> \u2013 The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.\n&nbsp;The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nSuch award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Location of Arbitration</em> \u2013 You or we may initiate arbitration in either San Francisco, CA or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.\n&nbsp;In the event that you select the latter, we may transfer the arbitration to San Francisco so long as we agree to pay any additional fees or costs which the arbitrator determines you incur as a result of the transfer.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs</em> \u2013 So long as you place a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, we will pay all arbitration fees and associated costs and expenses.\nBut, you will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to attorneys\u2019 fees or expert witnesses.\n&nbsp;In addition to any fees and costs recoverable under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with us as provided in the section above titled \u201cPre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\u201d and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and we specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.\n&nbsp;<strong>If you choose to pursue your dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.</strong> &nbsp;Neither you, nor any other user of the Sites can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Jury Waiver</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You understand and agree that by accepting this Provision in these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.\n&nbsp;In the absence of this Provision, you and we might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).\n&nbsp;Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.\nOther rights that you would have if you went to court (e.g.,, the rights to both appeal and certain types of discovery) may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Severability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect.\n&nbsp;If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Continuation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Provision shall survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of the Sites.\n&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this Provision (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change and require us to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Section 18 - General<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In the event that any provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Sites constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Sites and our services, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>California state law and applicable U.S.\nfederal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms.\n&nbsp;Foreign laws do not apply.\nAny disputes relating to these Terms or the Sites will be heard in the courts located in San Francisco, California, USA.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Section 19 -&nbsp;California Consumer Notice<p>\n</p>\n<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California users are entitled to the
