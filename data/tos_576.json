users accessing Trello through an Atlassian account see the additional policies and procedures below.</em>\n</p> Certifications and Assessments <p>Trello, Inc.\n(\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) is SOC2 Type 2 certified\u2014we receive and review our data hosting providers\u2019 SOC1 and SOC2 reports every 6 months under NDA.\nTrello is ISO/IEC 27001 certified which validates our information security management system (ISMS) and the implementation of our security controls.\nMore information is available on the Atlassian Trust Management System.\nTrello is PCI-DSS certified.</p> GDPR and Data Transfers from Europe to the US <p>Trello, as an Atlassian company, invests significant resources in maintaining compliance with the GDPR and we also aim to help our customers comply with the processes and policies outlined.\nAtlassian also adheres to Standard Contractual Clauses as a means to transfer data from the EEA and UK to the US.\nLearn more.</p> Vulnerability Detection and Bug Bounty Program <p>Automated scans of Trello's production site are conducted a minimum of every 7 days.\nAll changes are peer reviewed and vulnerability and security lists are actively monitored for CVE and other vulnerability disclosures with appropriate actions taken.\nWe participate in an active bug bounty program on Bugcrowd and mitigate all material findings as appropriate.</p> Data Centers and Location <p>Trello production services are hosted on Amazon Web Services\u2019 (\u201cAWS\u201d) EC2 platform.\nThe physical servers are located in AWS\u2019s EC2 data centers.\nAs of this date, AWS (i) has certifications for compliance with ISO/IEC 27001:2013, 27017:2015 and 27018:2014, (ii) is certified as a PCI DSS 3.2 Level 1 Service Provider, and (iii) undergoes SOC 1, SOC 2 and SOC 3 audits (with semi-annual reports).\nAdditional details about AWS\u2019 compliance programs, including FedRAMP compliance, can be found at AWS\u2019 website.<sup>1</sup>\n</p>\n<p>All user content is stored within US regions of AWS and Google Cloud Storage (\"GCS\").\nTrello\u2019s production environment is hosted on an AWS EC2 platform.\nUser content can also be found in Trello backups, stored in AWS EC2, S3, Glacier, and GCS.</p>\n<p>We do not offer customers the option of hosting Trello on a private server, or to otherwise use Trello on a separate infrastructure.</p> Production Environment <p>We maintain separate and distinct production, staging, and development environments for Trello.</p>\n<p>To access Trello\u2019s production environment, authorized and trained members of Trello's SRE and select Engineering team members (\u201cAuthorized Personnel\u201d) authenticate to the VPN using unique strong passwords and TOTP based 2FA and then only access the production environment via ssh terminal connections using passphrase protected personal RSA certificates.\nAn IDS system is in place on all production servers, which includes real-time monitoring and alerting of any changes to the production system files or configuration and anomalous security events.\nFor Authorized Personnel, any workstations running Windows or macOS must be running current and active anti-virus software.\nThose members are also trained not to replicate non-public user data stored in Trello\u2019s production environment onto their workstations or mobile devices.</p> Network Security <p>Trello uses Akamai for DDoS protection.\nAWS Network ACL and Security Groups are used to restrict access to Trello\u2019s systems as appropriate to their role.\nActive monitoring of these security rules is in place with alerting mechanisms in place for any changes to the configuration.\nPublic access is restricted to port 443 and 80 on the network load balancers for public traffic.\nAtlassian's Workplace Technology team protects our wireless networks by utilizing WPA2-AES authentication and PEAP-EAP-MSCHAPv2 encryption.\nWe authenticate to our wireless network through 802.1x utilizing our internal identity store.\nWe scan for rogue wireless access points regularly, and maintain a list of rogue access points found.</p> Login Security <p>SAML 2.0 SSO is supported for Trello Enterprise customers.\nAll customers can enable 2FA on their accounts or use Google OAuth.\nIf SSO or OAuth is used to access Trello, Trello will inherit the login security settings in the user's IdP or Google account.</p>\n<p>If logging in directly to Trello using a username or email and password, Trello requires a minimum of 8 characters.\nRepeated failed login attempts trigger a 30 second lock before a user can retry.\nPasswords are stored in a hashed form and will never be sent via email\u2014upon account creation and password reset, Trello will send a link to the email associated with the account that will enable the user to create a new password.</p>\n<p>Password complexity and session length requirements cannot be customized within the app.\nHowever, these can be set within an IdP for an SSO-enforced team.</p> Access Control <p>All user data stored in Trello is protected in accordance with our obligations in the Atlassian Cloud Terms of Service, and access to such data by Authorized Personnel is based on the principle of least privilege.\nOnly Authorized Personnel have direct access to Trello\u2019s production systems.\nThose who do have direct access to production systems are only permitted to view user data stored in Trello in the aggregate, for troubleshooting purposes or as otherwise permitted in Trello\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Trello maintains a list of Authorized Personnel with access to the production environment.\nThese members undergo criminal background checks and are approved by Trello\u2019s Engineering management.\nTrello also maintain a list of personnel who are permitted to access Trello code, as well as the development and staging environments.\nThese lists are reviewed quarterly and upon role change.</p>\n<p>Trained members of the Atlassian and Trello customer support teams also have case-specific, limited access to user data stored in Trello through restricted access customer support tools.\nCustomer support team members are not authorized to review non-public user data stored in Trello for customer support purposes without explicit permission.\nWhen a Trello user submits a support ticket, they have the option of authorizing the customer support team to view their data.\nThe customer support team will only receive such access to the account if it is granted by the user, either by selecting the \"Give support staff temporary access to your account\" option when submitting a help request, or by clicking a link sent to the user's email by the support team.\nThe account owner can revoke such access at any time.<sup>2</sup>\n</p>\n<p>Upon role change or leaving the company, the production credentials of Authorized Personnel are deactivated, and their sessions are forcibly logged out.\nThereafter, all such accounts are removed or changed.</p> Public Content and Other Permissions <p>User data entered on public boards or included in public profile information may be viewed or accessed by anyone.\nIn addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, data may be collected, shared, retained and used as described in Trello\u2019s Privacy Policy or customer\u2019s agreement(s) with Trello.</p> Third Party Access <p>User data may be shared by Trello with third-party service providers (a user's email address for an email delivery provider, for example) pursuant to Trello\u2019s Privacy Policy and in compliance with Trello\u2019s applicable signed service agreements.</p> Physical Security <p>In some instances our offices share buildings with other companies.\nFor that reason, we require mandatory visitor check-in with the building security team and that visitors wear identification badges.\nAdditionally, visitors must check-in with our front desk and require an escort throughout the building at all times.\nEmployee access to physical facilities is protected by electronic badge readers and building security.\nCCTV covers entry and exit points 24/7 with logs made available to us internally.</p>\n<p>Trello's production services are hosted on Amazon Web Services\u2019 (\u201cAWS\u201d) EC2 platform.\nThe physical servers are located in AWS\u2019 secure data centers.<sup>3</sup> We require that production critical data is never to be stored by those with privileged access on physical media outside of our data hosting provider's production environments.\nSee above for information on AWS\u2019 compliance programs.</p> Corporate Environment and Removable Media <p>Strict firewall rules prohibit access to necessary ports for the usage of Trello (e.g., 443), to help ensure limited access to the production environment to our VPN network and authorized systems.\nOur corporate network has no additional access to the production environment, with Authorized Personnel required to connect to the VPN in order to access any special systems or environments.</p>\n<p>Authorized Personnel with access to Trello\u2019s production environment are trained as noted above.\nIn addition, employee workstations are required to time out and lock after a maximum of one minute once sleep or the screen saver begins.\nWe do not have a clean desk policy.</p> Encryption In-Transit <p>Trello uses industry standard Transport Layer Security (\u201cTLS\u201d) to create a secure connection using 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (\u201cAES\u201d) encryption.\nThis includes all data sent between the web, desktop, iOS, and Android apps and the Trello servers.\nThere is no non-TLS option for connecting to Trello.\nAll connections are made securely over HTTPS.</p> Encryption At-Rest <p>Data drives on servers holding user data use full disk, industry-standard AES encryption with a unique encryption key for each server.\nFile attachments to Trello cards are stored in Amazon\u2019s S3 service.\nEach such attachment is assigned a unique link with an unguessable, cryptographically strong random component, and are only accessible using a secure HTTPS connection.\nFile attachments to Trello cards uploaded after June 3, 2015 are encrypted using Amazon S3 server side 256-bit AES encryption.\nThe encryption, key management, and decryption process is inspected and verified internally by Amazon on a regular basis as part of their existing audit process.\nAt an Enterprise customer\u2019s request, attachments uploaded prior to June 3, 2015 can be retroactively encrypted within Amazon S3.\nAll Trello backups are encrypted with AES encryption.</p> Encryption Keys <p>Encryption keys for Trello attachments, stored in S3, are managed by Amazon.\nThe encryption, key management, and decryption process is inspected and verified internally by Amazon on a regular basis as part of their existing audit process.\nEncryption keys for Trello attachments managed by our team are rotated upon relevant changes of roles or employment status.\nEncryption keys managed by our team are not stored outside of Trello\u2019s production backup environment and are managed by the our SRE team.\nTrello backups are of the entire data set, so they are encrypted using a shared key.</p> Data Deletion - Termination of Agreement <p>Upon termination of a Trello Business Class or Enterprise contract, if requested by the Trello customer\u2019s administrator, the user content that is stored on the terminated team\u2019s boards, lists and cards will be completely removed from the live Trello production database.\nAll file attachments uploaded directly to Trello will be removed from the live Trello production database within 30 days.\nThe team\u2019s data will remain in encrypted Trello database backups until those backups fall out of the 90-day backup retention window and are destroyed in accordance with our data retention policy.\nIn the event that a database restore is necessary within 90 days of a requested data deletion, we will re-delete the data as soon as reasonably possible after the live production system is fully restored.</p>\n<p>For clarity, if a customer continues to use Trello pursuant to a free account or different plan following the termination of a Business Class or Enterprise contract, such data may be retained for use in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to such account or plan.</p> Data Deletion - User Personal Data <p>In the case of a Trello user account being deleted, upon deletion, Trello deletes the user\u2019s personal data, including items like name, email address and location, within 30 days of the request.\nAfter 30 days, such personal data will remain in encrypted Trello database backups until those backups fall out of the 90-day retention window and are completely destroyed.</p>\n<p>In certain cases where Trello has a legitimate business or legal purpose to do so, Trello may keep user personal data.\nSome examples of this include financial information related to things like purchases and billing records.\nrecords showing why the account was deleted.\nor data relating to a litigation or other legal inquiry.</p>\n<p>Upon deletion of an individual user account, Trello does not automatically delete the content that was created by individual users in Trello.\nFor example, items typed into cards like a comment or an added file will remain visible even if the removed user no longer exists.\nThe applicable team\u2019s administrators or users, depending on the permission settings, would need to delete that content manually.</p>\n<p>Users may have installed third party applications or custom applications, e.g., Power-Ups, that add features to Trello.\nThese apps may have stored user personal data.\nTo see a list of apps that may have stored personal data, users should navigate to their Trello Settings page (before deleting their account).</p> Development, Patch and Configuration Management <p>All changes to the Trello production system, be they code or system configuration changes, require review prior to deployment to the production environment.\nThousands of automated unit tests are run against all production code prior to deployment.\nProduction code is also subject to regularly conducted automated vulnerability scans.\nAll changes to Trello\u2019s code are tested in a staging environment prior to deployment to production.\nPatches to the Trello web client are deployed on a rolling basis, usually several times per week.\nTrello production servers are managed via a centralized configuration system.\nAll Trello system changes are peer reviewed and patches are deployed as relevant to their level of security and stability impact, with critical patches able to be deployed well within 24 hours of availability as appropriate.</p>\n<p>We restrict access as noted above and maintain separate lists of relevant roles with access to source code, development, staging, and production environments.\nThese lists are reviewed quarterly and upon role change.\nWe use source code management tools and repositories.</p>\n<p>All production servers are running a LTS (Long Term Support) distribution of their operating system to ensure timely updates are available.\nCVE lists and notifications are actively monitored and any systems can be patched in a timeline relevant to the severity of the issue.\nA centralized configuration system is used for the management of production servers, and when needed a patch can be deployed within hours of its availability.</p> Event Logging <p>Certain user actions which manipulate user data are stored within Trello and are available for the customer/user (e.g., when viewing the action history on a card, board, or team).\nThis information is available within Trello unless a card is deleted (not archived), at which point it cannot be restored.</p>\n<p>All Trello API calls and application logs are kept for our internal purposes for at least 45 days without sensitive information (no full user tokens, no user generated content), and are available only for authorized employees as required by their role for monitoring of Trello to ensure service availability and performance and to prevent abuse.</p>\n<p>Application logs for Trello are centrally collected in Splunk for a minimum of 45 days for monitoring and analysis.\nSecurity, authentication, and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) logs for Trello are additionally retained in S3 CloudWatch buckets with a 12 month lifecycle to ensure retention.</p> Asset Management <p>Atlassian maintains Asset Management Policies and implementation guidelines.\nThis policy is reviewed and updated in line with our Policy Management Program (PMP).\nAssets are transferred upon role change or leaving the company.\nFor more information, see: Security Management Program.\nYou can review the high level statements of each of our internal policies at: ISMP Policies</p> Data Within Trello <p>Trello validates files for well-formedness and the like, however, we have explicitly designed Trello to support any type of content users may choose to store within Trello.\nAll attachments are stored and accessed from a completely separate domain to help prevent any potential access by such attachment to other user data or cookies.</p> User Team Management and Access <p>Admins for a Trello Enterprise account will be set via the customer\u2019s account manager.\nAdmin, regular, and observer roles can be assigned within Trello.</p>\n<p>It is not possible to limit the geolocations allowed to access data within Trello.\nData can be accessed by users who have access to such data within the app from any geolocation.\nAll third-party developer access to user data stored in Trello is via the API which includes strict authorization checks.\nAll Authorized Personnel go through strict security group/firewall rules which limits access to authorized instance roles on authorized ports required for them to fulfill their role.</p>\n<p>Power-Ups cannot be restricted within a team.\nPower-Ups which connect Trello to other services (such as Evernote or Dropbox) may require authentication with an existing account in that service before the Power-Up is active.\nIf working within a corporate environment, the domain used to authenticate that account can be blocked in your environment's firewall.</p> Backup, Business Continuity, and Disaster Recovery Policy Backup Policy <p>Data entered into Trello is backed up regularly.\nAll backups are encrypted and stored at multiple offsite locations to help ensure that they are available in the unlikely event that a restore is necessary.</p>\n<p>Files uploaded to Trello as card attachments are not backed up on the same schedule, and instead rely on Amazon S3\u2019s internal redundancy mechanism.</p>\n<p>Files associated with Trello cards from a supported cloud storage provider are also subject to the storage provider\u2019s own backup procedures and policies.</p>\n<p>Trello database backups are immediately encrypted with 256-bit AES encryption using GNU Privacy Guard (\u201cGPG\u201d) with a password-protected symmetric cipher.\nEncrypted backups can only be decrypted by members of the Trello operations team who have received training and have been authorized to decrypt the backups.</p>\n<p>Because user data stored in Trello is on a shared infrastructure, it is not possible for us to recover a subset of that information from backups.\nIf any customer is particularly concerned with maintaining a complete record of their information in Trello, we suggest that such customer frequently exports its data or use our API<sup>4</sup> to connect a DLP tool to Trello.</p> Backup Interval <p>A rolling live replica of Trello\u2019s primary database is constantly being taken on a 1-hour delay.\nAdditionally, a full backup snapshot of the primary database is taken once every 24 hours.</p> Backup Storage <p>All Trello backups are retained on the following schedule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS EC2 on a dedicated backup server for two days</li>\n<li>AWS S3 for 7 days</li>\n<li>Google Cloud Storage for 30 days</li>\n<li>AWS Glacier for 90 days</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Only authorized members of the Trello operations team have access to the backup locations, so that they are able to monitor the performance of the backup processes, and in the very unlikely event that a restore becomes necessary.\nAfter 90 days, the encrypted backup files are destroyed.</p>\n<p>Attachments directly uploaded to Trello are handled differently than the primary database backups.\nTo backup file attachments, Trello primarily relies on S3\u2019s internal redundancy mechanism, which Amazon states provides 99.99% yearly data durability.\nAttachments are also backed up to Google Cloud Storage for additional redundancy.</p> Data Portability <p>Trello board data is available for export by board members in JSON format via the Trello REST API.\nFile attachments can be individually retrieved directly from Amazon S3 using the file\u2019s unique hyperlink.</p>\n<p>Trello personal data is available for export by individual users in JSON format and can be found by clicking this link.\nThe \u201cDownload Personal Data\u201d button will export personal data and deliver it via an API endpoint in JSON format.</p>\n<p>Trello Business Class and Enterprise plans offer a simplified data export process for all team data and attachments.\nEach Business Class and Enterprise team includes one-click export of all Boards within the team.\nOptionally, file attachments uploaded directly to Trello can be included in the export file.\nWithin the export, each board\u2019s data is included in both JSON and Comma Separated Values (\u201cCSV\u201d) format.</p> Business Continuity <p>The Trello operations team has designed systems to keep the service running even if the underlying infrastructure experiences an outage or other significant issue.\nEvery critical Trello service has a secondary, replicated service running simultaneously with mirrored data in a different AWS availability zone than the primary server.\nAdditionally, each Trello database server has a replicated service running in a third availability zone with data that is mirrored on a one hour delay.</p>\n<p>Because it is critical to have reliable access to your business\u2019 important projects and data, Trello has been architected to survive a single availability zone outage without significant service interruptions.</p> Disaster Recovery <p>In the unlikely event that two Amazon EC2 availability zones have long-term service interruptions, Trello has been designed to recover with limited service interruption and a target maximum of 1 hour of data loss.</p>\n<p>In the even more unlikely event that Trello\u2019s entire AWS EC2 region is irrecoverably lost, we will restore servers using automated configuration systems.\nIn this event, Trello\u2019s systems are designed to recover user data as quickly as reasonably possible, with a target of no more than of 24 hours of data loss.</p>\n<p>Trello's SRE team regularly tests the various components of its Business Continuity architecture to ensure continued operations.\nTrello does not currently run anything like Chaos Monkey.</p>\n<p>Trello does not have an SLA or credit policy.\nTrello had over 99.99% uptime in 2018 and 2019, and any downtime is documented at Trello's status page.<sup>5</sup>\n</p> Incidents and Response <p>A Trello problem impacting a Trello Enterprise customer will be assigned a Severity Level and handled according to the resolutions in Table 1.</p>\n<p>Table 1: Incidents and Response Severity Levels:</p> Level Description Resolution Examples Severity 1 Trello is not available or is unusable.\nWork begins within 1 hour from report, temporary resolution within 4 hours, final resolution within 7 hours.\nThe site is not responding.\nall text on the site is being translated into elven runes.\nSeverity 2 Service or performance is substantially degraded in a way that prevents normal use.\nWork begins within 2 hours from report, temporary resolution within 48 hours, final resolution within 14 days.\nSearch only finds cards with the search terms in the title.\nTrello cannot be used with the new Firefox version that came out today.\nSeverity 3 A service not essential to Trello\u2019s main functionality is unavailable or degraded.\nWork begins within 72 hours from report, temporary resolution within 7 days, final resolution within 30 days.\nActivity indicators are not showing who is active.\nupdates are taking 30 seconds to propagate to other board viewers.\nSeverity 4 Minor or cosmetic issues with Trello services, and all feature requests.\nResolution at Trello team\u2019s discretion.\nBoard background images aren\u2019t scaling properly.\nfeature request for dependencies between cards.\nEmployee Policies Anti-Virus <p>Trello has a centrally managed antivirus solution deployed across both our Windows and macOS environments.\nFor Authorized Personnel, any workstations running Windows or macOS used for ssh terminal access to the production environment must be running update-to-date and active instances of our centrally deployed Cylance antivirus software with real-time monitoring and at-least-daily updates.</p>\n<p>Authorized Personnel may choose to run linux as their workstation operating system.\nGiven the inadequate state of linux antivirus software and the lack of prevalence of viruses for that platform, our policy does not require those workstations to run antivirus.\nAll of the existing controls for Authorized Personnel, including restricting access from those workstations to the production environment via ssh terminal connections only and with no replication of user data onto those workstations, still apply.</p> Remote Access <p>Many of Trello\u2019s team members work remotely.\nStrict firewall rules are in place thus limiting access to the production environment to our VPN network and authorized systems.\nCertain other controls described above, including Authorized Personnel and corporate environment controls, also apply to remote access as appropriate.</p> Security Awareness and Confidentiality <p>Security awareness and user data access policies are covered during our employee onboarding as appropriate to the role and employees are updated as relevant policies or practices change.\nOur employees also sign a confidentiality agreement.</p>\n<p>In the event that a security policy is breached by an employee, Trello reserves the right to determine the appropriate response, which may include termination.</p> Background Checks <p>All our employees undergo an extensive interview process before hiring.\nOur employees with direct access to the production environment undergo a criminal background check.\nOther employees may undergo a check depending on their role (e.g., academic for legal roles or credit for finance roles).\nAppropriate NDAs are in place with third parties as appropriate.</p> Maintenance Policy Planned Maintenance <p>When it is necessary to perform planned maintenance on Trello services, the Trello operations team will perform the work during one of two scheduled weekly maintenance windows.\nWe will make reasonable efforts to announce maintenance procedures that could potentially impact users of Trello on the @trellostatus Twitter account<sup>6</sup> at least 24 hours prior to the event, and via an in-app announcement at least 30 minutes prior to the event.</p> Planned Maintenance Windows <ul>\n<li>Tuesday from 10:00 PM US Eastern Time through Wednesday at 2:00 AM US Eastern Time</li>\n<li>Saturday from 10:00 PM US Eastern Time through Sunday at 2:00 AM US Eastern Time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These windows have been selected with the goal of minimizing service downtime, slowness, or other impact to the people and businesses that rely on Trello.</p>\n<p>We do our best to make outages as short as possible.\nAdditionally, our maintenance schedule will frequently be evaluated to ensure that we keep user impact as low as reasonably possible.\nShould we need to reschedule these windows, the updated schedule will be announced on our Status Blog and Twitter accounts with reasonable advance notice.</p> Unplanned Maintenance <p>Due to unforeseen events, we may have to infrequently perform unplanned maintenance on Trello infrastructure or software components.\nThis maintenance might cause some or all of the Trello services to be inaccessible by our users for a period of time.\nIt is our goal to do this as infrequently as possible.\nAny unplanned or emergency maintenance that causes Trello to be inaccessible will be announced on the Trello Status Blog and in-app with as much advance notice as reasonably possible.\nAs with planned maintenance, we do our best to minimize disruption caused by service outages.</p>\n<p>It is not possible for us to customize the maintenance window, as our users are on a shared infrastructure.\nHowever, we've used this maintenance window extremely rarely\u2014about once a year, for under 15 minutes each time.</p> Users who access Trello through an Atlassian account <p>As part of Trello's continued integration into Atlassian, Trello users will have to create Atlassian accounts in order to access the Trello service.\nFor Trello users accessing Trello through an Atlassian account, including accounts managed by organizations subscribing to Atlassian Access, the following policies and procedures, which may differ the policies and procedures above, shall apply.</p> Data Centers and Location <p>As mentioned above, Trello production services and associated user content (i.e., data stored to Trello boards) are stored in AWS\u2019s and GCS\u2019s United States regions.\nHowever, a limited amount of user information used for account authentication purposes may be stored in AWS and GCS regions outside of the United States.\nFor more information on how we secure and store data at Atlassian, see our Trust page.</p> Login Security <p>If you login to Trello using your Atlassian account or if your account is managed by an organization that subscribes to Atlassian Access, login security (including single sign-on and two-step verification) and password features and policies for Atlassian accounts differ from those of legacy Trello accounts.\nMore information about these features and policies is available at Your Atlassian Account and Atlassian Access Policies and Features.</p> Data Deletion <p>If a user accesses Trello through an Atlassian account, the processes and policies for deleting the user\u2019s Trello account and personal data, including deletion request cancellation grace periods and backup data retention periods may differ from the Trello processes and policies outlined above.\nFor more information, see Delete Your Atlassian Account.</p> Support and Incident Response <p>The support policies and incident response procedures for Atlassian Access differ from those applicable to Trello.\nMore information regarding support for Atlassian Access is available at Atlassian Access Policies and Features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Footnotes:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<sup>1</sup>http://aws.amazon.com/security/</p>\n<p>\n<sup>2</sup>https://trello.com/your/account</p>\n<p>\n<sup>3</sup>http://aws.amazon.com/security/</p>\n<p>\n<sup>4</sup>http://developers.trello.com/</p>\n<p>\n<sup>5</sup>https://trello.status.atlassian.com/</p>\n<p>\n<sup>6</sup>https://twitter.com/trellostatus</p>

enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others&nbsp;by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may use your stated job title and activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job function.&nbsp.\nWe also use information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject matter expertise.&nbsp;We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites.&nbsp;Where you&nbsp;use multiple Services, we combine information about

to identify trends, usage, activity patterns, and areas for integration and&nbsp;to improve our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public.&nbsp;For example, to&nbsp;improve the&nbsp;@mention feature, we automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to&nbsp;surface the most relevant connections for users.\nWe automatically analyze and aggregate frequently used search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature.&nbsp;In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features, to better integrate the Services you use, or to provide you with insights based on how others use our Services.\nWe also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>To communicate with you about the Services</strong>\n</em>: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.&nbsp.\nWe send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are&nbsp;@mentioned on a page or ticket,&nbsp;when a task is&nbsp;assigned to you, or when you are added to a Trello board.\nDepending on your chosen method of contact, we may send you SMS notifications or call you if you are on-call for incident alerts in Opsgenie.&nbsp;We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.&nbsp.\nFor example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier.&nbsp.\nWe also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.&nbsp;These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out&nbsp;of them.&nbsp.\nIf an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: </strong>\n</em>We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies' websites and applications.&nbsp.\nThese communications may be informed by audits of interactions (like counting ad impressions), and are&nbsp;aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including&nbsp;information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp.\nWe also communicate with you about new Services, product offers, promotions, and contests.&nbsp.\nYou can control whether you receive these communications as described below under \"Opt-out of communications.\"</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Customer support</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.&nbsp;Where you give us express permission to do so, we share information with a third party expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For safety and security</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to detect, prevent, and respond to potential or actual security incidents and to monitor and protect against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, including violations&nbsp;of Service policies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights</em>:</strong>&nbsp;Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and&nbsp;disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With your&nbsp;consent</strong>\n</em>: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.&nbsp.\nThe legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them.&nbsp;This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>\n<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote&nbsp;the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>\n<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.\nor</li>\n<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.&nbsp.\nWhere we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g.\nyour employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> How we share information we collect <p>We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you.&nbsp.\nThis means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties.&nbsp.\nWe share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below,&nbsp;including in connection with possible business transfers.\nWe are not in the business of selling&nbsp;information about you to advertisers or other third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing with other Service users&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For collaboration</strong>\n</em>: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator&nbsp;(if applicable) select.&nbsp.\nSome of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you comment&nbsp;on a Confluence page or Jira issue, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or issue understand who made the comment.\nSimilarly, when you publish a Confluence page, your name is displayed as the author of that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.&nbsp.\nYour team\u2019s story status in Jira Align or certain profile information when you are listed in an Opsgenie on-call schedule, can be seen by other users with certain role permissions or team assignments.\nPlease be aware that some aspects of the Services like Confluence pages,&nbsp;Bitbucket repositories, or Trello boards&nbsp;can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted in that space,&nbsp;including information about you, can be publicly viewed,&nbsp;indexed by, and returned in search results of search engines.&nbsp.\nYou can confirm whether certain Service properties are publicly visible from within the Services or by contacting the relevant administrator.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Managed accounts&nbsp;and administrators</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization or associate that email address with your existing account, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization\u2019s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain.&nbsp.\nIf you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Community Forums</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp.\nOur websites offer&nbsp;publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and wikis (e.g.,&nbsp;Atlassian Community,&nbsp;Atlassian Developer Community,&nbsp;Trello Community, and Trello Inspiration).&nbsp;You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.&nbsp.\nYour posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account.&nbsp;We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services.&nbsp;To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below.\nIn some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we&nbsp;will&nbsp;let you know if we are unable to and why.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing with third parties</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We share information with third parties that help us&nbsp;operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Service Providers</strong>\n</em>: We&nbsp;work with third-party service providers&nbsp;to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to&nbsp;access or use information about you.&nbsp.\nIf a service provider needs to&nbsp;access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including appropriate security and confidentiality&nbsp;procedures designed to protect your information.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Atlassian Partners</strong>\n</em>: We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, support, and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services.\nWe may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations.&nbsp.\nWe may also share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Third Party Apps</strong>\n</em>: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to&nbsp;add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps within the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like&nbsp;your name and email address,&nbsp;and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.&nbsp.\nIf you are an administrator, or a&nbsp;technical or billing contact listed on an account, we share your details with the third-party app provider upon installation.&nbsp;Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices.&nbsp;If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Links to Third Party Sites</strong>\n</em>: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours.\nIf you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one.\nWe encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Third Party Services:</strong>\n</em>&nbsp;We may offer you the ability to interact with or share information with third parties through the Services.\nFor example, we may offer users the ability to log in to the Services via a third-party service like Google, access embedded maps through Google Maps or interact with social media networks via links on the Services.\nWhen you intentionally interact with these third parties, we may share certain information with those third parties or receive information with those third parties, consistent with your privacy settings on the third-party service.\nSuch information may include contact information, identification, and demographic information, and device information and identifiers.\nYou should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Third Party Widgets</strong>\n</em>: Some&nbsp;of our services contain widgets and social media features, such&nbsp;as the Twitter \"tweet\" button or Facebook \"like\" button.\nThese widgets and features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nWidgets and social media features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Services.\nYou should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With your consent</strong>\n</em>: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so.&nbsp.\nFor example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites.\nWith your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws.\nEnforcement of Our Rights</strong>\n</em>: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,&nbsp;including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our&nbsp;products and services, (d) protect Atlassian, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.\nFor more information on how we respond to government requests, see our Guidelines for Law Enforcement and our Transparency Report.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing with affiliated companies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We share information we collect with affiliated companies and, in some cases, with prospective affiliates.&nbsp.\nAffiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us.&nbsp.\nThe protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we share in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Atlassian companies</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;We share information we have about you with other Atlassian corporate affiliates in order to operate and improve products and services and to offer other Atlassian affiliated services to you.&nbsp;This includes companies that own or operate the Services listed here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Business Transfers</strong>\n</em>: We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.\nYou will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.</p> How we store and secure information we collect <p>\n<strong>Information storage and security</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store.&nbsp;For more information on where and how we store your information, please see the Atlassian&nbsp;Trust, Trello Trust,&nbsp;and Jira Align Trust pages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet,&nbsp;we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care,&nbsp;is&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;safe&nbsp;from&nbsp;intrusion by others.</p>\n<p>If you use our server or data center Services, responsibility for securing storage and access to the information you put into the Services rests with you and not Atlassian.\nWe strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of information transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How long we keep information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.&nbsp.\nAfter such time, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Account information</strong>\n</em>: We&nbsp;retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.&nbsp.\nWe also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.\nWhere we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information&nbsp;to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Information you share on the Services</strong>\n</em>: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.&nbsp.\nFor example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided,&nbsp;but when requested details that can identify you will be removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Managed&nbsp;accounts</strong>\n</em>: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.&nbsp.\nFor more information, see \"Managed accounts and administrators\" above.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Marketing&nbsp;information</strong>\n</em>: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Atlassian account.&nbsp.\nWe retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p> How to access and control your information <p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information.\nBelow is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Choices</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format.&nbsp.\nBelow, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.&nbsp.\nYou can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account.&nbsp;Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see \"Notice to End Users\" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below&nbsp;to request assistance.</p>\n<p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.&nbsp.\nWhere you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.&nbsp.\nIf you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Access and update your information</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;Our Services and related documentation&nbsp;(see Atlassian Documentation and Trello Help) give you the ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;access and update certain information about you from within the Service.\nFor example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using key word searches in the Service.&nbsp.\nYou can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Deactivate your&nbsp;account</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account.\nIf you can deactivate your own account, that setting is&nbsp;available to you in your account settings.\nOtherwise, please contact your administrator.\nIf you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact the appropriate support team (see&nbsp;Atlassian, Jira Align, or Trello support pages).&nbsp.\nPlease be aware that&nbsp;deactivating your account does not delete your information.\nyour information remains visible to&nbsp;other&nbsp;Service users based on your past participation within the Services.&nbsp.\nFor more information on how to delete your information, see below.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Delete your information</strong>\n</em>: Our Services and related documentation&nbsp;(see Atlassian Documentation and Trello Help) give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service.\nFor example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content, and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings.\nPlease note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Request that we stop using your information</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time.\nYou can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.&nbsp.\nIf there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).&nbsp;&nbsp;If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Opt out of&nbsp;communications</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences&nbsp;within your&nbsp;Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.&nbsp.\nEven after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our&nbsp;Services.\nYou can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings.&nbsp;Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads.</p>\n<p>You may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.\nFor more

Notice.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Send \"Do Not Track\" Signals</strong>\n</em>: Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.\nBecause there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.\nYou can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us&nbsp;as described above.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Data&nbsp;portability</strong>\n</em>: Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier).&nbsp.\nDepending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.&nbsp.\nShould you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the spaces under your sole&nbsp;control, like your personal Bitbucket repository.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> How we transfer information we collect internationally <p>\n<strong>International transfers of information we collect</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect

Atlassian\u2019s Cloud Products!&nbsp.\nThese Atlassian Cloud Terms of Service (these <strong>\u201cTerms\u201d</strong>) describe your rights and responsibilities as a customer of our Cloud Products.\nAs applicable to the specific Cloud Product, if you are being invited or added to a Cloud Product set up by an Atlassian customer, the&nbsp;User Notice&nbsp;governs your access and use of the Cloud Product (and not these Terms).&nbsp.\nThese Terms are between you and the Atlassian entity that owns or operates the Cloud Product that you are using or accessing listed here&nbsp;(<strong>\u201cAtlassian\u201d</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>\u201cwe\u201d</strong> or <strong>\u201cus\u201d</strong>).&nbsp.\n<strong>\u201cYou\u201d</strong> means the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or, if that does not apply, you individually.&nbsp.\nIf you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms.\n(ii) you have read and understand these Terms.\nand (iii) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party that you represent.\nIf you don\u2019t have the legal authority to bind your employer or the applicable entity please do not click \u201cI agree\u201d (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you.&nbsp.\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A CLOUD PRODUCT USING AN EMAIL ADDRESS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, THEN (A) YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT SUCH PARTY, (B) YOUR CLICK TO ACCEPT WILL BIND YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY TO THESE TERMS, AND (C) THE WORD \u201cYOU\u201d IN THESE TERMS WILL REFER TO YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>These Terms are effective as of the date you first click \u201cI agree\u201d (or similar button or checkbox) or use or access a Cloud Product, whichever is earlier (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d).\nThese Terms do not have to be signed in order to be binding.\nYou indicate your assent to these Terms by clicking \u201cI agree\u201d (or similar button or checkbox) at the time you register for a Cloud Product, create a Cloud Product account, or place an Order.&nbsp;For No-Charge Products, you also indicate your assent to these Terms by accessing or using the applicable No-Charge Product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nWhat these Terms cover.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.1.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Cloud Products</u>.\nThese Terms govern our Cloud Products, related Support, and Additional Services.\nThese Terms include Our Policies (including our Privacy Policy), the Product-Specific Terms, and your Orders.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.2.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Product-Specific Terms</u>.&nbsp;Some Cloud Products may be subject to additional terms specific to that product as set forth in the Product-Specific Terms.\nBy accessing or using a product covered by the Product-Specific Terms, you also agree to the Product-Specific Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.3.</strong>\n<u>Expanded Coverage Addendum</u>.\nCertain qualifying Cloud Products are also subject to the Expanded Coverage Addendum, as specified in such terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.4.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Software Products Not Covered</u>.\nThese Terms do not apply to our downloadable software products (currently designated as \u201cServer\u201d and \u201cData Center\u201d deployments), use of which requires a separate license agreement with us.\nFor clarity, however, any client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) we provide as part of the Cloud Products themselves remains subject to these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nHow Cloud Products are administered.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1.</strong>\n<u>Administrators</u>.\nThrough the Cloud Products, you may be able to specify certain End Users as Administrators, who will have important rights and controls over your use of Cloud Products and End User Accounts.\nThis may include making Orders for Cloud Products or enabling Apps (which may incur fees).\ncreating, de-provisioning, monitoring or modifying End User Accounts, and setting End User usage permissions.\nand managing access to Your Data by End Users or others.\nAdministrators may also take over management of accounts previously registered using an email address belonging to your domain (which become \u201cmanaged accounts\u201d, as described in our Documentation).\nWithout limiting Section 2.4 (Responsibility for End Users), which fully applies to Administrators, you are responsible for whom you allow to become Administrators and any actions they take, including as described above.\nYou agree that our responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Cloud Products for you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Reseller as Administrator</u>.\nIf you order Cloud Products through a Reseller, then you are responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in your applicable agreement with the Reseller.&nbsp.\nAs between you and Atlassian, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other End User Accounts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3.</strong>&nbsp;<u>End User Consent</u>.&nbsp;You will provide all required disclosures to and will obtain and maintain all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) Administrators to have the access described in these Terms and the Privacy Policy.\nand (ii) Atlassian\u2019s provision of the Cloud Products to Administrators and End Users.\nYou will provide evidence of such consents upon our reasonable request.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Responsibility for End Users</u>.\nOur Cloud Products have various user onboarding flows.\nSome Cloud Products require users to be designated by Administrators.\nsome allow users to sign up for individual accounts which can become associated with teams or organizations at a later time.\nand some may allow users to invite other users.\nYou are responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Product you use and for controlling whom you allow to become an End User.\nIf payment is required for End Users to use or access a Cloud Product, then we are only required to provide the Cloud Products to those End Users for whom you have paid the applicable fees, and only such End Users are permitted to access and use the Cloud Products.\nSome Cloud Products may allow you to designate different types of End Users (for example, Jira Service Management&nbsp;distinguishes between \u201cagents\u201d and \u201ccustomers\u201d), in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of End User.\nYou are responsible for compliance with these Terms by all End Users, including for any payment obligations.\nPlease note that you are responsible for the activities of all your End Users, including Orders they may place and how End Users use Your Data, even if those End Users are not from your organization or domain.\nWe may display our User Notice&nbsp;to End Users at sign up, account creation, Cloud Product registration, or in-product.\nIf you use&nbsp;single sign-on (SSO) for identity management of your Cloud Product(s) such that End Users will bypass these screens and our User Notice, you are responsible for displaying our User Notice&nbsp;to End Users and for any damages resulting from your failure to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.5.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Credentials</u>.&nbsp;You must require that all End Users keep their user IDs and passwords for the Cloud Products strictly confidential and do not share such information with any unauthorized person.\nUser IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared.\nYou are responsible for any and all actions taken using End User Accounts and passwords, and you agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of which you become aware.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.6.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Age Requirement for End Users</u>.&nbsp;The Cloud Products are not intended for, and should not be used by, anyone under the age of 16.\nYou are responsible for ensuring that all End Users are at least 16 years old.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.7.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Domain Name Ownership</u>.&nbsp;Where you are required to specify a domain for the operation of a Cloud Product or certain Cloud Product features, we may verify that you own or control that domain.\nIf you do not own or control the domain you specify, then we will have no obligation to provide you with the Cloud Product or Cloud Product features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nWhat's included in your Cloud Product subscriptions.\nwhat are the restrictions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.1.</strong>\n<u>Access to Cloud Products</u>.&nbsp;Subject to these Terms and during the applicable Subscription Term, you may access and use the Cloud Products for your own business purposes or personal use, as applicable, all in accordance with these Terms, the applicable Order and the Documentation.\nThis includes the right, as part of your authorized use of the Cloud Products, to download and use the client software associated with the Cloud Products.\nThe rights granted to you in this Section 3.1 are non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2.</strong>\n<u>Support</u>.&nbsp;During the Subscription Term, we will provide Support for the Cloud Products in accordance with the Support Policy, Enterprise Support and Services Policy (to the extent applicable), and the applicable Order.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.3.</strong>\n<u>Restrictions</u>.&nbsp;Except as otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, you will not: (a) reproduce, modify, adapt or create derivative works of the Cloud Products.\n(b) rent, lease, distribute, sell, sublicense, transfer or provide access to the Cloud Products to a third party.\n(c) use the Cloud Products for the benefit of any third party.\n(d) incorporate any Cloud Products into a product or service you provide to a third party.\n(e) interfere with or otherwise circumvent mechanisms in the Cloud Products intended to limit your use.\n(f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or non-public APIs to any Cloud Products, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law (and then only upon advance notice to us).\n(g) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in any Cloud Product.\n(h) use the Cloud Products for competitive analysis or to build competitive products.\n(i) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Cloud Products.\nor (j) encourage or assist any third party to do any of the foregoing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nOur security and data privacy

information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which you acknowledge.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.3.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Improving Cloud Products</u>.\nWe are always striving to improve the Cloud Products.\nIn order to do so, we use analytics techniques to better understand how our Cloud Products are being used.\nFor more information on these techniques and the type of data collected, please

license also includes the right to make modifications and derivative works.\nWe may also access your accounts, End User Accounts, and your Cloud Products with End User permission in order to respond to your support requests.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2.</strong>\n<u>Your Data Compliance Obligations</u>.&nbsp;You and your use of Cloud Products (including use by your End Users) must comply at all times

Products.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.3.</strong>\n<u>No Prohibited Sensitive Personal Information</u>.\nYou will not submit to the Cloud Products (or use the Cloud Products to collect) any Sensitive Personal Information unless its processing is expressly supported as a feature of the applicable Cloud Product in the applicable Documentation.\nNotwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, we have no liability under these Terms for Sensitive Personal Information submitted in violation of the foregoing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.4.</strong>\n<u>Your Indemnity</u>.&nbsp;You will defend, indemnify and hold harmless us (and our Affiliates, officers, directors, agents and employees) from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019

terms <strong>\u201cApps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cAtlassian Apps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cThird Party Apps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cVendor\u201d</strong> and <strong>\u201cVendor Terms\u201d</strong> are defined in the Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use, which is a separate agreement governing use of the Atlassian Marketplace.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nUsing Atlassian developer assets.&nbsp;</strong>Access to any of our APIs, SDKs or other Atlassian developer assets is subject to the Atlassian Developer Terms, which is a separate agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nAdditional

Order.\nAdditional Services may be subject to additional policies and terms as specified by us, including the Enterprise Support and Services Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2.</strong>\n<u>Our Deliverables</u>.&nbsp;We will retain all right, title and interest in and to Our Deliverables.\nYou may use any of Our Deliverables provided to you only in connection with the Cloud Products, subject to the same usage rights and restrictions as for the Cloud Products.\nFor clarity, Our Deliverables are not considered Cloud Products, and any Cloud Products are not considered to be Our Deliverables.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.3.</strong>\n<u>Your Materials</u>.&nbsp;You agree to provide us with reasonable access to Your Materials as reasonably necessary for our provision of Additional Services.\nIf you do not provide us with timely access to Your Materials, our performance of Additional Services will be excused until you do so.\nYou retain your rights in Your Materials, subject to our ownership of any Cloud Products, any of Our Deliverables or any of Our Technology underlying Your Materials.\nWe will use Your Materials solely for purposes of performing the Additional Services.\nYou represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights in Your Materials to provide them to us for such purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.4.</strong>\n<u>Training Not Covered</u>.&nbsp;Your purchase, and our provision, of Training is subject to our Training Terms and Policies, which is a separate agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nBilling, renewals, and payment.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.1.</strong>\n<u>Monthly and Annual Plans</u>.\nExcept for No-Charge Products, all Cloud Products are offered either on a monthly subscription basis or an annual subscription basis.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.2.</strong>\n<u>Renewals</u>.&nbsp;Except as otherwise specified in your Order, unless either party cancels your subscription prior to expiration of the current Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically renew for another Subscription Term of a period equal to your initial Subscription Term.\nYou will provide any notice of non-renewal through the means we designate, which may include account settings in the Cloud Products or contacting our support team.\nCancelling your subscription means that you will not be charged for the next billing cycle, but you will not receive any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been charged.\nAll renewals are subject to the applicable Cloud Product continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.3.</strong>\n<u>Adding Users</u>.&nbsp;You may add users, increase storage limits, or otherwise increase your use of Cloud Products by placing a new Order or modifying an existing Order.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, we will charge you for any increased use at our then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.4.</strong>\n<u>Payment</u>.&nbsp;You will pay all fees in accordance with each Order, by the due dates and in the currency specified in the Order.\nIf a PO number is required in order for an invoice to be paid, then you must provide such PO number to Atlassian by emailing the PO number to accountsreceivable@atlassian.com.\nFor Additional Services provided at any non-Atlassian location, unless otherwise specified in your Order, you will reimburse us for our pre-approved travel, lodging and meal expenses, which we may charge as incurred.\nOther than as expressly set forth in Section 10 (Our return policy), 18.3 (Warranty Remedy), Section 20 (IP Indemnification) or Section 24 (Changes to these Terms), all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable.\nYou agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.5.</strong>\n<u>Delivery</u>.&nbsp;We will deliver the login instructions for Cloud Products to your&nbsp;account or through other reasonable means no later than when we have received payment of the applicable fees.\nYou are responsible for accessing your account to determine that we have received payment and that your Order has been processed.\nAll deliveries under these Terms will be electronic.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nOur return policy.&nbsp;</strong>As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction and without limiting the Performance Warranty in Section 18 (Warranties and Disclaimer), you may terminate your initial Order of a Cloud Product under these Terms, for no reason or any reason, by providing notice of termination to us no later than thirty (30) days after the Order date for such Cloud Product.\nIn the event you terminate your initial Order under this Section 10, at your request (which may be made through your account with us), we will refund you the amount paid under such Order.\nThis termination and refund right applies only to your initial Order of the Cloud Product and only if you exercise your termination right within the period specified above, and does not apply to Additional Services.\nYou understand that we may change this practice in the future in accordance with Section 24 (Changes to these Terms).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nTaxes not included.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.1.</strong>\n<u>Taxes</u>.\nYour fees under these Terms exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Cloud Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received.\nTo the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by us, you must pay to us the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under these Terms.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed, you may provide us with such exemption information, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with invoicing documents designed to enable you to obtain a refund or credit from the relevant revenue authority, if such a refund or credit is available.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.</strong>\n<u>Withholding Taxes</u>.&nbsp;You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes.\nYou and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available.\nIf we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof.\nYou will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nIf you purchased through a Reseller.\n</strong> If you make any purchases through an&nbsp;authorized partner or reseller of Atlassian (<strong>\u201cReseller\u201d</strong>):</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;Instead of paying us, you will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between you and the Reseller.\nWe may suspend or terminate your rights to use Cloud Products if we do not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;Your order details (e.g., the Cloud Products you are entitled to use, the number of End Users, the Subscription Term, etc.) will be as stated in the Order placed with us by the Reseller on your behalf, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order as communicated to us.</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;If you are entitled to a refund under these Terms, then unless we otherwise specify, we will refund any applicable fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to you.</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp;Resellers are not authorized to modify these Terms or make any promises or commitments on our behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth in these Terms.</p>\n<p>(e) The amount paid or payable by the Reseller to us for your use of the applicable Cloud Product under these Terms will be deemed the amount actually paid or payable by you to us under these Terms for purposes of calculating the liability cap in Section 19.2.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nNo contingencies on other products of future functionality.&nbsp;</strong>You acknowledge that the Cloud Products and Additional Services referenced in an Order are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services.\nPayment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other products (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Products and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Order).\nYou agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Products beyond the current Subscription Term), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nEvaluations, trials, and betas.</strong> We may offer certain Cloud Products (including some Atlassian Apps) to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use and Beta Versions as defined below (collectively, <strong>\u201cNo-Charge Products\u201d</strong>).\nYour use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted during the Subscription Term we designate (or, if not designated, until terminated in accordance with these Terms).\nExcept as otherwise set forth in this Section 14, the terms and conditions of these Terms governing Cloud Products, including Section 3.3 (Restrictions), fully apply to No-Charge Products.\nWe may modify or terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you.\nYou understand that any pre-release and beta Cloud Products, and any pre-release and beta features within generally available Cloud Products, that we make available (collectively, \u201c<strong>Beta Versions</strong>\u201d) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Cloud Products.\nWe make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available.\nIn some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 14.\nAll information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of any No-Charge Products (including Beta Versions) constitutes our Confidential Information.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support, warranty and indemnity obligations.\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THESE TERMS, OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN RESPECT OF NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS WILL BE US$100.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.\nIP Rights in the Cloud Products and Feedback.</strong> Cloud Products are made available on a limited access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as \u201cpurchase\u201d or \u201csale\u201d.\nWe and our licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Our Technology (including the Cloud Products).\nFrom time to time, you may choose to submit Feedback to us.\nWe may in connection with any of our products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.\nNo Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in these Terms limits our right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products or services, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nConfidentiality.</strong> Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how and business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party (<strong>\u201cReceiving Party\u201d</strong>) by the disclosing party (<strong>\"Disclosing Party\"</strong>) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (<strong>\u201cConfidential Information\u201d</strong>), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny of Our Technology and any performance information relating to the Cloud Products will be deemed our Confidential Information without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under these Terms.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know, provided that they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 16 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by them with the terms of this Section 16.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party).\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nTerm and Termination.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.1.</strong>\n<u>Term</u>.\nThese Terms are effective as of the Effective Date and expire on the date of expiration or termination of all Subscription

for Convenience</u>.&nbsp;You may choose to stop using the Cloud Products and terminate these Terms (including all Orders) at any time for any reason upon written notice to us, but, unless you are

already paid all applicable fees for the then-current Subscription Term or related services period (as applicable), any such fees that are outstanding will become immediately due and

will not have access to Your Data (and we may delete all of Your Data unless legally prohibited) after expiration or termination of these Terms (or its applicable Subscription Term), so you should make sure to export Your Data using the functionality of the Cloud Products during the applicable Subscription Term.\nIf you terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 17.2 (Termination for Cause), we will refund you any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term after the effective date of termination.\nIf we terminate these Terms in accordance with

relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.\nExcept where an exclusive remedy may be specified in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under these Terms, by law or

pre-paid for use of the Cloud Product for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.\nThe Performance Warranty will not apply: (i) unless you make a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which you first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the non-conformity was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party products, software, services or equipment or (iii) to

Agreement\u00a0and Trello Terms of Service.\nPlease read this agreement carefully.\nTo learn more about the changes visit Atlassian's\u00a0Summary of Changes\u00a0and Trello's Summary of Changes.\nIf you choose not to accept the updated terms, make sure to cancel your cloud subscriptions prior to your next renewal and refrain from ordering new Atlassian products.</p> Atlassian Cloud Terms of Service <p>\n<em>Effective starting: November 1, 2018</em>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Thanks for using Atlassian\u2019s Cloud Products!\u00a0 These Atlassian Cloud Terms of Service (these <strong>\u201cTerms\u201d</strong>) describe your rights and responsibilities as a customer of our Cloud Products.\u00a0 If you are being invited or added to a Cloud Product set up by an Atlassian customer, the\u00a0User Notice\u00a0governs your access and use of the Cloud Product (and not these Terms).\u00a0 These Terms are between you and the Atlassian entity that owns or operates the Cloud Product that you are using or accessing listed here\u00a0(<strong>\u201cAtlassian\u201d</strong>,\u00a0<strong>\u201cwe\u201d</strong> or <strong>\u201cus\u201d</strong>).\u00a0 <strong>\u201cYou\u201d</strong> means the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or, if that does not apply, you individually.\u00a0 If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms.\n(ii) you have read and understand these Terms.\nand (iii) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party that you represent.\nIf you don\u2019t have the legal authority to bind your employer or the applicable entity please do not click \u201cI agree\u201d (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you.\u00a0 <strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A CLOUD PRODUCT USING AN EMAIL ADDRESS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, THEN (A) YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT SUCH PARTY, (B) YOUR CLICK TO ACCEPT WILL BIND YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY TO THESE TERMS, AND (C) THE WORD \u201cYOU\u201d IN THESE TERMS WILL REFER TO YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>These Terms are effective as of the date you first click \u201cI agree\u201d (or similar button or checkbox) or use or access a Cloud Product, whichever is earlier (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d).\nThese Terms do not have to be signed in order to be binding.\nYou indicate your assent to these Terms by clicking \u201cI agree\u201d (or similar button or checkbox) at the time you register for a Cloud Product, create a Cloud Product account, or place an Order.\u00a0For No-Charge Products, you also indicate your assent to these Terms by accessing or using the applicable No-Charge Product.\u00a0\u00a0</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nWhat these Terms cover.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.1.</strong>\u00a0<u>Cloud Products</u>.\nThese Terms govern our Cloud Products, related Support, and Additional Services.\nThese Terms include Our Policies (including our Privacy Policy), the Product-Specific Terms, and your Orders.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.2.</strong>\u00a0<u>Product-Specific Terms</u>.\u00a0Some Cloud Products may be subject to additional terms specific to that product as set forth in the Product-Specific Terms.\nBy accessing or using a product covered by the Product-Specific Terms, you also agree to the Product-Specific Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.3.</strong>\u00a0<u>Software Products Not Covered</u>.\nThese Terms do not apply to our downloadable software products (currently designated as \u201cServer\u201d and \u201cData Center\u201d deployments), use of which requires a separate license agreement with us.\nFor clarity, however, any client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) we provide as part of the Cloud Products themselves remains subject to these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nHow Cloud Products are administered.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1.</strong>\n<u>Administrators</u>.\nThrough the Cloud Products, you may be able to specify certain End Users as Administrators, who will have important rights and controls over your use of Cloud Products and End User Accounts.\nThis may include making Orders for Cloud Products or enabling Apps (which may incur fees).\ncreating, de-provisioning, monitoring or modifying End User Accounts, and setting End User usage permissions.\nand managing access to Your Data by End Users or others.\nAdministrators may also take over management of accounts previously registered using an email address belonging to your domain (which become \u201cmanaged accounts\u201d, as described in our Documentation).\nWithout limiting Section 2.4 (Responsibility for End Users), which fully applies to Administrators, you are responsible for whom you allow to become Administrators and any actions they take, including as described above.\nYou agree that our responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Cloud Products for you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2.</strong>\u00a0<u>Reseller as Administrator</u>.\nIf you order Cloud Products through a Reseller, then you are responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in your applicable agreement with the Reseller.\u00a0 As between you and Atlassian, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other End User Accounts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3.</strong>\u00a0<u>End User Consent</u>.\u00a0You will provide all required disclosures to and will obtain and maintain all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) Administrators to have the access described in these Terms and the Privacy Policy.\nand (ii) Atlassian\u2019s provision of the Cloud Products to Administrators and End Users.\nYou will provide evidence of such consents upon our reasonable request.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4.</strong>\u00a0<u>Responsibility for End Users</u>.\nOur Cloud Products have various user onboarding flows.\nSome Cloud Products require users to be designated by Administrators.\nsome allow users to sign up for individual accounts which can become associated with teams or organizations at a later time.\nand some may allow users to invite other users.\nYou are responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Product you use and for controlling whom you allow to become an End User.\nIf payment is required for End Users to use or access a Cloud Product, then we are only required to provide the Cloud Products to those End Users for whom you have paid the applicable fees, and only such End Users are permitted to access and use the Cloud Products.\nSome Cloud Products may allow you to designate different types of End Users (for example, Jira Service Desk distinguishes between \u201cagents\u201d and \u201ccustomers\u201d), in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of End User.\nYou are responsible for compliance with these Terms by all End Users, including for any payment obligations.\nPlease note that you are responsible for the activities of all your End Users, including Orders they may place and how End Users use Your Data, even if those End Users are not from your organization or domain.\nWe may display our User Notice\u00a0to End Users at sign up, account creation, Cloud Product registration, or in-product.\nIf you use\u00a0single sign-on (SSO) for identity management of your Cloud Product(s) such that End Users will bypass these screens and our User Notice, you are responsible for displaying our User Notice\u00a0to End Users and for any damages resulting from your failure to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.5.</strong>\u00a0<u>Credentials</u>.\u00a0You must require that all End Users keep their user IDs and passwords for the Cloud Products strictly confidential and do not share such information with any unauthorized person.\nUser IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared.\nYou are responsible for any and all actions taken using End User Accounts and passwords, and you agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of which you become aware.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.6.</strong>\u00a0<u>Age Requirement for End Users</u>.\u00a0The Cloud Products are not intended for, and should not be used by, anyone under the age of 16.\nYou are responsible for ensuring that all End Users are at least 16 years old.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.7.</strong>\u00a0<u>Domain Name Ownership</u>.\u00a0Where you are required to specify a domain for the operation of a Cloud Product or certain Cloud Product features, we may verify that you own or control that domain.\nIf you do not own or control the domain you specify, then we will have no obligation to provide you with the Cloud Product or Cloud Product features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nWhat's included in your Cloud Product subscriptions.\nwhat are the restrictions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.1.</strong>\n<u>Access to Cloud Products</u>.\u00a0Subject to these Terms and during the applicable Subscription Term, you may access and use the Cloud

and non-transferable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2.</strong>\n<u>Support</u>.\u00a0During the Subscription Term, we will provide Support for the Cloud Products in accordance with the Support Policy,

obligation to monitor any content uploaded to the Cloud Products.\nNonetheless, if we deem such action necessary based on your violation of these Terms, including Our Policies, or in response to takedown requests that we receive following our guidelines for\u00a0Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations, we may (1) remove Your Data from the Cloud Products or (2) suspend your access to the Cloud Products.\nWe will use reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of removals and suspensions when practicable, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the Cloud Product or other users, we may suspend your access or remove Your Data immediately without notice.\nWe have no liability to you for removing or deleting Your Data from or suspending your access to any Cloud Products as described in this Section 5.5.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nUsing third-party products with the Cloud Products.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.1.</strong>\u00a0<u>Third-Party Products</u>.\nYou (including your End Users) may choose to use or procure other third party products or services in connection with the Cloud Products, including Third Party Apps (see Section 6.2 (Marketplace Apps)) or implementation, customization, training or other services.\nYour receipt or use of any third party products or services (and the third parties\u2019 use of any of Your Data) is subject to a separate agreement between you and the third party provider.\nIf you enable or use third party products or services with the Cloud Products (including Third Party Apps as referenced in Section 6.2 (Marketplace Apps)), we will allow the third party providers to access or use Your Data as required for the interoperation of their products and services with the Cloud Products.\nThis may include transmitting, transferring, modifying or deleting Your Data, or storing Your Data on systems belonging to the third party providers or other third parties.\nAny third party provider\u2019s use of Your Data is subject to the applicable agreement between you and such third party provider.\n<strong>We are not responsible for any access to or use of Your Data by third party providers or their

provider.\nWE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES (WHETHER SUPPORT, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY OR OTHERWISE) OR FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OR VENDORS.\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2.</strong>\u00a0<u>Marketplace Apps</u>.\nAs further described in the Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use, the Atlassian Marketplace lists a variety of Apps that may be used with Cloud Products, including both Atlassian Apps and Third Party Apps.\nAtlassian Apps for Cloud Products are considered \u201cCloud Products\u201d under these Terms (unless we specify otherwise through the Atlassian Marketplace).\nThird Party Apps are not Cloud Products and remain subject to their own applicable Vendor Terms.\nWe may enable interoperation of the Cloud Products with Third Party Apps as set forth in Section 6.1 (Third-Party Products).\nThe terms <strong>\u201cApps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cAtlassian Apps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cThird Party Apps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cVendor\u201d</strong> and <strong>\u201cVendor Terms\u201d</strong> are defined in the Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use, which is a separate agreement governing use of the Atlassian Marketplace.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nUsing Atlassian developer assets.\u00a0</strong>Access to any of our APIs, SDKs or other Atlassian developer assets is subject to the

you may purchase Additional Services that we will provide to you pursuant to the applicable Order.\nAdditional Services may be subject to additional policies and terms as specified by us, including the Enterprise Support and Services Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2.</strong>\n<u>Our Deliverables</u>.\u00a0We will retain all right, title and interest in and to Our Deliverables.\nYou may use any of Our Deliverables provided to you only in connection with the Cloud Products, subject to the same usage rights and restrictions as for the Cloud Products.\nFor clarity, Our Deliverables are not considered Cloud Products, and any Cloud Products are not considered to be Our Deliverables.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.3.</strong>\n<u>Your Materials</u>.\u00a0You agree to provide us with reasonable access to Your Materials as reasonably necessary for our provision of Additional Services.\nIf you do not provide us with timely access to Your Materials, our performance of Additional Services will be excused until you do so.\nYou retain your rights in Your Materials, subject to our ownership of any Cloud Products, any of Our Deliverables or any of Our Technology underlying Your Materials.\nWe will use Your Materials solely for purposes of performing the Additional Services.\nYou represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights in Your Materials to provide them to us for such purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.4.</strong>\n<u>Training Not Covered</u>.\u00a0Your purchase, and our provision, of Training is subject to our Training Terms and Policies, which is a separate agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nBilling, renewals, and payment.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.1.</strong>\n<u>Monthly and Annual Plans</u>.\nExcept for No-Charge Products, all Cloud Products are offered either on a monthly subscription basis or an annual subscription basis.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.2.</strong>\n<u>Renewals</u>.\u00a0Except as otherwise specified in your Order, unless either party cancels your subscription prior to expiration of the current Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically renew for another Subscription Term of a period equal to your initial Subscription Term.\nYou will provide any notice of non-renewal through the means we designate, which may include account settings in the Cloud Products or contacting our support team.\nCancelling your subscription means that you will not be charged for the next billing cycle, but you will not receive any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been charged.\nAll renewals are subject to the applicable Cloud Product continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.3.</strong>\n<u>Adding Users</u>.\u00a0You may add users, increase storage limits, or otherwise increase your use of Cloud Products by placing a new Order or modifying an existing Order.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, we will charge you for any increased use at our then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.4.</strong>\n<u>Payment</u>.\u00a0You will pay all fees in accordance with each Order, by the due dates and in the currency specified in the Order.\nIf a PO number is required in order for an invoice to be paid, then you must provide such PO number to Atlassian by emailing the PO number to accountsreceivable@atlassian.com.\nFor Additional Services provided at any non-Atlassian location, unless otherwise specified in your Order, you will reimburse us for our pre-approved travel, lodging and meal expenses, which we may charge as incurred.\nOther than as expressly set forth in Section 10 (Our return policy), 18.3 (Warranty Remedy), Section 20 (IP Indemnification) or Section 24 (Changes to these Terms), all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable.\nYou agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.5.</strong>\n<u>Delivery</u>.\u00a0We will deliver the login instructions for Cloud Products to your\u00a0account or through other reasonable means no later than when we have received payment of the applicable fees.\nYou are responsible for accessing your account to determine that we have received payment and that your Order has been processed.\nAll deliveries under these Terms will be electronic.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nOur return policy.\u00a0</strong>As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction and without limiting the Performance Warranty in Section 18 (Warranties and Disclaimer), you may terminate your initial Order of a Cloud Product under these Terms, for no reason or any reason, by providing notice of termination to us no later than thirty (30) days after the Order date for such Cloud Product.\nIn the event you terminate your initial Order under this Section 10, at your request (which may be made through your account with us), we will refund you the amount paid under such Order.\nThis termination and refund right applies only to your initial Order of the Cloud Product and only if you exercise your termination right within the period specified above, and does not apply to Additional Services.\nYou understand that we may change this practice in the future in accordance with Section 24 (Changes to these Terms).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nTaxes not included.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.1.</strong>\n<u>Taxes</u>.\nYour fees under these Terms exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Cloud Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received.\nTo the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by us, you must pay to us the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under these Terms.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed, you may provide us with such exemption information, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with invoicing documents designed to enable you to obtain a refund or credit from the relevant revenue authority, if such a refund or credit is available.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.</strong>\n<u>Withholding Taxes</u>.\u00a0You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes.\nYou and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available.\nIf we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof.\nYou will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nIf you purchased through a Reseller.\n</strong> If you make any purchases through an\u00a0authorized partner or reseller of Atlassian (<strong>\u201cReseller\u201d</strong>):</p>\n<p>(a)\u00a0Instead of paying us, you will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between you and the Reseller.\nWe may suspend or terminate your rights to use Cloud Products if we do not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller.</p>\n<p>(b)\u00a0Your order details (e.g., the Cloud Products you are entitled to use, the number of End Users, the Subscription Term, etc.) will be as stated in the Order placed with us by the Reseller on your behalf, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order as communicated to us.</p>\n<p>(c)\u00a0If you are entitled to a refund under these Terms, then unless we otherwise specify, we will refund any applicable fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to you.</p>\n<p>(d)\u00a0Resellers are not authorized to modify these Terms or make any promises or commitments on our behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth in these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nNo contingencies on other products of future functionality.\u00a0</strong>You acknowledge that the Cloud Products and Additional Services referenced in an Order are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services.\nPayment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other products (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Products and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Order).\nYou agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Products beyond the current Subscription Term), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nEvaluations, trials, and betas.</strong> We may offer certain Cloud Products (including some Atlassian Apps) to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use and Beta Versions as defined below (collectively, <strong>\u201cNo-Charge Products\u201d</strong>).\nYour use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted during the Subscription Term we designate (or, if not designated, until terminated in accordance with these Terms).\nExcept as otherwise set forth in this Section 14, the terms and conditions of these Terms governing Cloud Products, including Section 3.3 (Restrictions), fully apply to No-Charge Products.\nWe may modify or terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you.\nYou understand that any pre-release and beta Cloud Products, and any pre-release and beta features within generally available Cloud Products, that we make available (collectively, \u201c<strong>Beta Versions</strong>\u201d) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Cloud Products.\nWe make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available.\nIn some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 14.\nAll information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of any No-Charge Products (including Beta Versions) constitutes our Confidential Information.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support, warranty and indemnity obligations.\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THESE TERMS, OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN RESPECT OF NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS WILL BE US$100.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.\nIP Rights in the Cloud Products and Feedback.</strong> Cloud Products are made available on a limited access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as \u201cpurchase\u201d or \u201csale\u201d.\nWe and our licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Our Technology (including the Cloud Products).\nFrom time to time, you may choose to submit Feedback to us.\nWe may in connection with any of our products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.\nNo Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in these Terms limits our right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products or services, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nConfidentiality.</strong> Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how and business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party (<strong>\u201cReceiving Party\u201d</strong>) by the disclosing party (<strong>\"Disclosing Party\"</strong>) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (<strong>\u201cConfidential Information\u201d</strong>), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny of Our Technology and any performance information relating to the Cloud Products will be deemed our Confidential Information without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under these Terms.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know, provided that they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 16 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by them with the terms of this Section 16.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party).\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nTerm and Termination.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.1.</strong>\n<u>Term</u>.\nThese Terms are

including on any third-party systems operated on your behalf.\nYou will certify such deletion upon our request.\nYou will not have access to Your Data (and we may delete all of Your Data unless legally prohibited) after expiration or termination of these Terms (or its applicable Subscription Term), so you should make sure to export Your Data using the functionality of the Cloud Products

then-current Subscription Term after the effective date of termination.\nIf we terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 17.2 (Termination for Cause), you will pay any unpaid fees covering the

any other remedies it may have under these Terms, by law or otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.5.</strong>\n<u>Survival</u>.\u00a0The following provisions will survive any termination or expiration of

pre-paid for use of the Cloud Product for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.\nThe Performance Warranty will not apply: (i) unless you make a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which you first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the non-conformity was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party products, software, services or equipment or (iii) to

Service <p>\n<em>Effective starting: August 6, 2019</em>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks for using Atlassian\u2019s Cloud Products!&nbsp.\nThese Atlassian Cloud Terms of Service (these <strong>\u201cTerms\u201d</strong>) describe your rights and responsibilities as a customer of our Cloud Products.\nAs applicable to the specific Cloud Product, if you are being invited or added to a Cloud Product set up by an Atlassian customer, the&nbsp;User Notice&nbsp;governs your access and use of the Cloud Product (and not these Terms).&nbsp.\nThese Terms are between you and the Atlassian entity that owns or operates the Cloud Product that you are using or accessing listed here&nbsp;(<strong>\u201cAtlassian\u201d</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>\u201cwe\u201d</strong> or <strong>\u201cus\u201d</strong>).&nbsp.\n<strong>\u201cYou\u201d</strong> means the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or, if that does not apply, you individually.&nbsp.\nIf you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms.\n(ii) you have read and understand these Terms.\nand (iii) you agree to these Terms on behalf of the party that you represent.\nIf you don\u2019t have the legal authority to bind your employer or the applicable entity please do not click \u201cI agree\u201d (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you.&nbsp.\n<strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A CLOUD PRODUCT USING AN EMAIL ADDRESS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, THEN (A) YOU WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT SUCH PARTY, (B) YOUR CLICK TO ACCEPT WILL BIND YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY TO THESE TERMS, AND (C) THE WORD \u201cYOU\u201d IN THESE TERMS WILL REFER TO YOUR EMPLOYER OR THAT ENTITY.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>These Terms are effective as of the date you first click \u201cI agree\u201d (or similar button or checkbox) or use or access a Cloud Product, whichever is earlier (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d).\nThese Terms do not have to be signed in order to be binding.\nYou indicate your assent to these Terms by clicking \u201cI agree\u201d (or similar button or checkbox) at the time you register for a Cloud Product, create a Cloud Product account, or place an Order.&nbsp;For No-Charge Products, you also indicate your assent to these Terms by accessing or using the applicable No-Charge Product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nWhat these Terms cover.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.1.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Cloud Products</u>.\nThese Terms govern our Cloud Products, related Support, and Additional Services.\nThese Terms include Our Policies (including our Privacy Policy), the Product-Specific Terms, and your Orders.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.2.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Product-Specific Terms</u>.&nbsp;Some Cloud Products may be subject to additional terms specific to that product as set forth in the Product-Specific Terms.\nBy accessing or using a product covered by the Product-Specific Terms, you also agree to the Product-Specific Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.3.</strong>\n<u>Expanded Coverage Addendum</u>.\nCertain qualifying Cloud Products are also subject to the Expanded Coverage Addendum, as specified in such terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.4.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Software Products Not Covered</u>.\nThese Terms do not apply to our downloadable software products (currently designated as \u201cServer\u201d and \u201cData Center\u201d deployments), use of which requires a separate license agreement with us.\nFor clarity, however, any client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) we provide as part of the Cloud Products themselves remains subject to these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nHow Cloud Products are administered.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1.</strong>\n<u>Administrators</u>.\nThrough the Cloud Products, you may be able to specify certain End Users as Administrators, who will have important rights and controls over your use of Cloud Products and End User Accounts.\nThis may include making Orders for Cloud Products or enabling Apps (which may incur fees).\ncreating, de-provisioning, monitoring or modifying End User Accounts, and setting End User usage permissions.\nand managing access to Your Data by End Users or others.\nAdministrators may also take over management of accounts previously registered using an email address belonging to your domain (which become \u201cmanaged accounts\u201d, as described in our Documentation).\nWithout limiting Section 2.4 (Responsibility for End Users), which fully applies to Administrators, you are responsible for whom you allow to become Administrators and any actions they take, including as described above.\nYou agree that our responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Cloud Products for you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Reseller as Administrator</u>.\nIf you order Cloud Products through a Reseller, then you are responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in your applicable agreement with the Reseller.&nbsp.\nAs between you and Atlassian, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other End User Accounts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3.</strong>&nbsp;<u>End User Consent</u>.&nbsp;You will provide all required disclosures to and will obtain and maintain all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) Administrators to have the access described in these Terms and the Privacy Policy.\nand (ii) Atlassian\u2019s provision of the Cloud Products to Administrators and End Users.\nYou will provide evidence of such consents upon our reasonable request.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Responsibility for End Users</u>.\nOur Cloud Products have various user onboarding flows.\nSome Cloud Products require users to be designated by Administrators.\nsome allow users to sign up for individual accounts which can become associated with teams or organizations at a later time.\nand some may allow users to invite other users.\nYou are responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Product you use and for controlling whom you allow to become an End User.\nIf payment is required for End Users to use or access a Cloud Product, then we are only required to provide the Cloud Products to those End Users for whom you have paid the applicable fees, and only such End Users are permitted to access and use the Cloud Products.\nSome Cloud Products may allow you to designate different types of End Users (for example, Jira Service Management&nbsp;distinguishes between \u201cagents\u201d and \u201ccustomers\u201d), in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of End User.\nYou are responsible for compliance with these Terms by all End Users, including for any payment obligations.\nPlease note that you are responsible for the activities of all your End Users, including Orders they may place and how End Users use Your Data, even if those End Users are not from your organization or domain.\nWe may display our User Notice&nbsp;to End Users at sign up, account creation, Cloud Product registration, or in-product.\nIf you use&nbsp;single sign-on (SSO) for identity management of your Cloud Product(s) such that End Users will bypass these screens and our User Notice, you are responsible for displaying our User Notice&nbsp;to End Users and for any damages resulting from your failure to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.5.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Credentials</u>.&nbsp;You must require that all End Users keep their user IDs and passwords for the Cloud Products strictly confidential and do not share such information with any unauthorized person.\nUser IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared.\nYou are responsible for any and all actions taken using End User Accounts and passwords, and you agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of which you become aware.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.6.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Age Requirement for End Users</u>.&nbsp;The Cloud Products are not intended for, and should not be used by, anyone under the age of 16.\nYou are responsible for ensuring that all End Users are at least 16 years old.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.7.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Domain Name Ownership</u>.&nbsp;Where you are required to specify a domain for the operation of a Cloud Product or certain Cloud Product features, we may verify that you own or control that domain.\nIf you do not own or control the domain you specify, then we will have no obligation to provide you with the Cloud Product or Cloud Product features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nWhat's included in your Cloud Product subscriptions.\nwhat are the restrictions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.1.</strong>\n<u>Access to Cloud Products</u>.&nbsp;Subject to these Terms and during the applicable Subscription Term, you may access and use the Cloud Products for your own business purposes or personal use, as applicable, all in accordance with these Terms, the applicable Order and the Documentation.\nThis includes the right, as part of your

and non-transferable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2.</strong>\n<u>Support</u>.&nbsp;During the Subscription Term, we will provide Support for the Cloud Products in accordance with the Support Policy,

a third party.\n(c) use the Cloud Products for the benefit of any third party.\n(d) incorporate any Cloud Products into a product or service you provide to a third party.\n(e) interfere with or otherwise circumvent mechanisms in the Cloud Products intended to limit your use.\n(f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or non-public APIs to any Cloud Products, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law (and then only upon advance notice to us).\n(g) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in any Cloud Product.\n(h) use the Cloud Products for competitive analysis or to build competitive products.\n(i) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Cloud Products.\nor (j) encourage or assist any third party to do any of the foregoing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nOur security and data privacy

the Cloud Products.\nSubject to these Terms, and solely to the extent necessary to provide the Cloud Products to you, you grant us a worldwide, limited term license to access, use, process, copy, distribute, perform, export, and display&nbsp;Your Data.\nSolely to the extent that reformatting Your Data for display in a Cloud Product constitutes a modification or derivative work, the foregoing license also includes the right to make modifications and derivative works.\nWe may also access your accounts, End User Accounts, and your Cloud Products with End User permission in order to respond to your support requests.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2.</strong>\n<u>Your Data Compliance Obligations</u>.&nbsp;You and your use of Cloud Products (including use by your End Users) must comply at all times with these Terms, the&nbsp;Acceptable Use Policy&nbsp;and all Laws.\nYou represent and warrant that: (i) you have obtained all necessary rights, releases and permissions to submit all Your Data to the Cloud Products and to grant the rights granted to us in these Terms and (ii) Your Data and its submission and use as you authorize in these Terms will not violate (1) any Laws, (2) any third-party

Cloud Products, (ii) your breach (or alleged breach) of Sections 5.2 (Your Data Compliance Obligations) or 5.3 (No Prohibited Sensitive Personal Information).\nor (iii) Your Materials.\nThis indemnification obligation is subject to you receiving (a) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for you to respond without prejudice).\n(b) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense or settlement of such claim and (c) all reasonable necessary cooperation by us at your expense.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.5.</strong>\n<u>Removals and Suspension</u>.&nbsp;We have no obligation to monitor any content uploaded to the Cloud Products.\nNonetheless, if we deem such action necessary based on your violation of these Terms, including Our Policies, or in response to takedown requests that we receive following our guidelines for&nbsp;Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations, we may (1) remove Your Data from the Cloud Products or (2) suspend your access to the Cloud Products.\nWe will use reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of removals and suspensions when practicable, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the Cloud Product or other users, we may suspend your access or remove Your Data immediately without notice.\nWe have no liability to you for removing or deleting Your Data from or suspending your access to any Cloud Products as described in this Section 5.5.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nUsing third-party products with the Cloud Products.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.1.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Third-Party Products</u>.\nYou (including your End Users) may choose to use or procure other third party products or services in connection with the Cloud Products, including Third Party Apps (see Section 6.2 (Marketplace Apps)) or implementation, customization, training or other services.\nYour receipt or use of any third party products or services (and the third parties\u2019 use of any of Your Data) is subject to a separate agreement between you and the third party provider.\nIf you enable or use third party products or services with the Cloud Products (including Third Party Apps as referenced in Section 6.2 (Marketplace Apps)), we will allow the third party providers to access or use Your Data as required for the interoperation of their products and services with the Cloud Products.\nThis may include transmitting, transferring, modifying or deleting Your Data, or storing Your Data on systems belonging to the third party providers or other third parties.\nAny third party provider\u2019s use of Your Data is subject to the applicable agreement between you and such third party provider.\n<strong>We are not

agreement between you and the third party provider, as provided by the applicable third party provider.\nWE DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES (WHETHER SUPPORT, AVAILABILITY, SECURITY OR OTHERWISE) OR FOR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS OR VENDORS.&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Marketplace Apps</u>.\nAs further described in the Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use, the Atlassian Marketplace lists a variety of Apps that may be used with Cloud Products, including both Atlassian Apps and Third Party Apps.\nAtlassian Apps for Cloud Products are considered \u201cCloud Products\u201d under these Terms (unless we specify otherwise through the Atlassian Marketplace).\nThird Party Apps are not Cloud Products and remain subject to their own applicable Vendor Terms.\nWe may enable interoperation of the Cloud Products with Third Party Apps as set forth in Section 6.1 (Third-Party Products).\nThe terms <strong>\u201cApps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cAtlassian Apps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cThird Party Apps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cVendor\u201d</strong> and <strong>\u201cVendor

assets.&nbsp;</strong>Access to any of our APIs, SDKs or other Atlassian developer assets is subject to the Atlassian Developer Terms, which is a separate agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nAdditional Services.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.1.</strong>\n<u>Additional Services</u>.\nSubject to these Terms, you may purchase Additional Services that we will provide to you pursuant to the applicable Order.\nAdditional Services may be subject to additional policies and terms as specified by us, including the Enterprise Support and Services Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2.</strong>\n<u>Our Deliverables</u>.&nbsp;We will retain all right, title and interest in and to Our Deliverables.\nYou may use any of Our Deliverables provided to you only in connection with the Cloud Products, subject to the same usage rights and restrictions as for the Cloud Products.\nFor clarity, Our Deliverables are not considered Cloud Products, and any Cloud Products are not considered to be Our Deliverables.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.3.</strong>\n<u>Your Materials</u>.&nbsp;You agree to provide us with reasonable access to Your Materials as reasonably necessary for our provision of Additional Services.\nIf you do not provide us with timely access to Your Materials, our performance of Additional Services will be excused until you do so.\nYou retain your rights in Your Materials, subject to our ownership of any Cloud Products, any of Our Deliverables or any of Our Technology underlying Your Materials.\nWe will use Your Materials solely for purposes of performing the Additional Services.\nYou represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights in Your Materials to provide them to us for such purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.4.</strong>\n<u>Training Not Covered</u>.&nbsp;Your purchase, and our provision, of Training is subject to our Training Terms and Policies, which is a separate agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nBilling, renewals, and payment.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.1.</strong>\n<u>Monthly and Annual Plans</u>.\nExcept for No-Charge Products, all Cloud Products are offered either on a monthly subscription basis or an annual subscription basis.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.2.</strong>\n<u>Renewals</u>.&nbsp;Except as otherwise specified in your Order, unless either party cancels your subscription prior to expiration of the current Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically renew for another Subscription Term of a period equal to your initial Subscription Term.\nYou will provide any notice of non-renewal through the means we designate, which may include account settings in the Cloud Products or contacting our support team.\nCancelling your subscription means that you will not be charged for the next billing cycle, but you will not receive any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been charged.\nAll renewals are subject to the applicable Cloud Product continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.3.</strong>\n<u>Adding Users</u>.&nbsp;You may add users, increase storage limits, or otherwise increase your use of Cloud Products by placing a new Order or modifying an existing Order.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, we will charge you for any increased use at our then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.4.</strong>\n<u>Payment</u>.&nbsp;You will pay all fees in accordance with each Order, by the due dates and in the currency specified in the Order.\nIf a PO number is required in order for an invoice to be paid, then you must provide such PO number to Atlassian by emailing the PO number to accountsreceivable@atlassian.com.\nFor Additional Services provided at any non-Atlassian location, unless otherwise specified in your Order, you will reimburse us for our pre-approved travel, lodging and meal expenses, which we may charge as incurred.\nOther than as expressly set forth in Section 10 (Our return policy), 18.3 (Warranty Remedy), Section 20 (IP Indemnification) or Section 24 (Changes to these Terms), all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable.\nYou agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.5.</strong>\n<u>Delivery</u>.&nbsp;We will deliver the login instructions for Cloud Products to your&nbsp;account or through other reasonable means no later than when we have received payment of the applicable fees.\nYou are responsible for accessing your account to determine that we have received payment and that your Order has been processed.\nAll deliveries under these Terms will be electronic.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nOur return policy.&nbsp;</strong>As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction and without limiting the Performance Warranty in Section 18 (Warranties and Disclaimer), you may terminate your initial Order of a Cloud Product under these Terms, for no reason or any reason, by providing notice of termination to us no later than thirty (30) days after the Order date for such Cloud Product.\nIn the event you terminate your initial Order under this Section 10, at your request (which may be made through your account with us), we will refund you the amount paid under such Order.\nThis termination and refund right applies only to your initial Order of the Cloud Product and only if you exercise your termination right within the period specified above, and does not apply to Additional Services.\nYou understand that we may change this practice in the future in accordance with Section 24 (Changes to these Terms).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nTaxes not included.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.1.</strong>\n<u>Taxes</u>.\nYour fees under these Terms exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Cloud Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received.\nTo the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by us, you must pay to us the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under these Terms.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed, you may provide us with such exemption information, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with invoicing documents designed to enable you to obtain a refund or credit from the relevant revenue authority, if such a refund or credit is available.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.</strong>\n<u>Withholding Taxes</u>.&nbsp;You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes.\nYou and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available.\nIf we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof.\nYou will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nIf you purchased through a Reseller.\n</strong> If you make any purchases through an&nbsp;authorized partner or reseller of Atlassian (<strong>\u201cReseller\u201d</strong>):</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;Instead of paying us, you will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between you and the Reseller.\nWe may suspend or terminate your rights to use Cloud Products if we do not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;Your order details (e.g., the Cloud Products you are entitled to use, the number of End Users, the Subscription Term, etc.) will be as stated in the Order placed with us by the Reseller on your behalf, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order as communicated to us.</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;If you are entitled to a refund under these Terms, then unless we otherwise specify, we will refund any applicable fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to you.</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp;Resellers are not authorized to modify these Terms or make any promises or commitments on our behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth in these Terms.</p>\n<p>(e) The amount paid or payable by the Reseller to us for your use of the applicable Cloud Product under these Terms will be deemed the amount actually paid or payable by you to us under these Terms for purposes of calculating the liability cap in Section 19.2.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nNo contingencies on other products of future functionality.&nbsp;</strong>You acknowledge that the Cloud Products and Additional Services referenced in an Order are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services.\nPayment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other products (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Products and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Order).\nYou agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Products beyond the current Subscription Term), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nEvaluations, trials, and betas.</strong> We may offer certain Cloud Products (including some Atlassian Apps) to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use and Beta Versions as defined below (collectively, <strong>\u201cNo-Charge Products\u201d</strong>).\nYour use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted during the Subscription Term we designate (or, if not designated, until terminated in accordance with these Terms).\nExcept as otherwise set forth in this Section 14, the terms and conditions of these Terms governing Cloud Products, including Section 3.3 (Restrictions), fully apply to No-Charge Products.\nWe may modify or terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you.\nYou understand that any pre-release and beta Cloud Products, and any pre-release and beta features within generally available Cloud Products, that we make available (collectively, \u201c<strong>Beta Versions</strong>\u201d) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Cloud Products.\nWe make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available.\nIn some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 14.\nAll information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of any No-Charge Products (including Beta Versions) constitutes our Confidential Information.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support, warranty and indemnity obligations.\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THESE TERMS, OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN RESPECT OF NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS WILL BE US$100.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.\nIP Rights in the Cloud Products and Feedback.</strong> Cloud Products are made available on a limited access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as \u201cpurchase\u201d or \u201csale\u201d.\nWe and our licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Our Technology (including the Cloud Products).\nFrom time to time, you may choose to submit Feedback to us.\nWe may in connection with any of our products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.\nNo Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in these Terms limits our right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products or services, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nConfidentiality.</strong> Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how and business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party (<strong>\u201cReceiving Party\u201d</strong>) by the disclosing party (<strong>\"Disclosing Party\"</strong>) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (<strong>\u201cConfidential Information\u201d</strong>), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny of Our Technology and any performance information relating to the Cloud Products will be deemed our Confidential Information without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under these Terms.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know, provided that they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 16 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by them with the terms of this Section 16.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party).\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nTerm and Termination.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.1.</strong>\n<u>Term</u>.\nThese Terms are effective as of the Effective Date and expire on the date of expiration or termination of all Subscription

of these Terms within thirty (30) days after notice.\n(b) ceases operation without a successor.\nor (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors\u2019 arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.3.</strong>\n<u>Termination for Convenience</u>.&nbsp;You may choose to stop using the Cloud Products and terminate these Terms (including all Orders) at any time for any reason upon written notice to us, but, unless you are exercising your right to terminate early pursuant to Section 10 (Our return policy), upon any such termination (i) you will not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees and (ii) if you have not already paid all applicable fees for the then-current Subscription Term or related services period (as applicable), any such fees that are outstanding will become immediately due and payable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.4.</strong>\n<u>Effects of Termination</u>.&nbsp;Upon any expiration or termination of these Terms, you must cease using all Cloud Products and delete (or at our request, return) all Confidential Information or other materials of ours in your possession, including on any third-party systems operated on your behalf.\nYou will certify such deletion upon our request.\nYou will not have access to Your Data (and we may delete all of Your Data unless legally prohibited) after expiration or termination of these Terms (or its applicable Subscription Term), so you should make sure to export Your Data using the functionality of the Cloud Products during the applicable Subscription Term.\nIf you terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 17.2 (Termination for Cause), we will refund you any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term after the effective date of termination.\nIf we terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 17.2 (Termination for Cause), you will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term after the effective date of termination.\nIn no event will termination relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.\nExcept where an exclusive remedy may be specified in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under these Terms, by law or

Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.2.</strong>&nbsp;<u>Our Warranties</u>.\nWe warrant, for your benefit only, that we use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent introduction of viruses, Trojan horses or similar harmful materials into the Cloud Products (but we are not responsible for harmful materials submitted by you or End Users) (the <strong>\u201cPerformance Warranty\u201d</strong>).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.3.</strong>\n<u>Warranty Remedy</u>.&nbsp;We will use commercially reasonable efforts, at no charge to you, to correct reported non-conformities with the Performance Warranty.\nIf we determine corrections to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable Subscription Term.\nIn this case, you will receive a refund of any fees you have pre-paid for use of the Cloud Product for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.\nThe Performance Warranty will not apply: (i) unless you make a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which you first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the non-conformity was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party products, software, services or equipment or (iii) to No-Charge Products.\nOur sole liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, for any breach of the Performance Warranty are set forth in this Section 18.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.4.</strong>\n<u>WARRANTY

THAT TRANSMISSIONS OF YOUR DATA WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE OR THAT UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTIES WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DEFEAT OUR SECURITY MEASURES OR THOSE OF OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.\nWE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.\nYOU MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.\nLimitation of Liability.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.1.</strong>\n<u>Consequential Damages Waiver</u>.\nEXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (AS DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) WILL HAVE ANY LIABILITY

the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 19 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and

brought against you by a third party alleging that the Cloud Products, when used as authorized under these Terms, infringe any third-party patent, copyright or trademark, or misappropriates any third-party trade secret enforceable in any jurisdiction that is a signatory to the Berne Convention (a \u201c<strong>Claim</strong>\u201d), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded on the Claim by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to via settlement executed by us (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of the Claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice).\n(b) reasonable assistance in the defense and investigation

your use of the Cloud Products is (or in your opinion is likely to be) enjoined, whether by court order or by settlement, or if we determine such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, we may, at our option and in our discretion: (i) procure the right for your continued use of the Cloud Product in accordance with these Terms.\n(ii) substitute a substantially functionally similar Cloud Product.\nor (iii) terminate your right to continue using the Cloud Product and refund any prepaid amounts for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.\nOur indemnification

than US$50,000.\n(2) if the Cloud Product is modified by any party other than us, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification.\n(3) if the Cloud Product is used in combination with any non-Atlassian product, software, service or equipment, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination.\n(4) to unauthorized use of Cloud Products.\n(5) to any Claim arising as a result of (y) Your Data or circumstances covered by your indemnification obligations in Section 5.4 (Your Indemnity) or (z) any third-party deliverables or

we use the information we collect about you.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>To provide the Services and personalize your experience</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate,&nbsp;maintain, and improve&nbsp;the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we use the name and picture you provide&nbsp;in your&nbsp;account to identify you to other Service users.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;Services also include&nbsp;tailored features that&nbsp;personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others&nbsp;by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may use your stated job title and activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job function.&nbsp.\nWe also use information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject matter expertise.&nbsp;We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites.&nbsp;Where you&nbsp;use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another&nbsp;or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites.&nbsp;Based on your interactions with different Atlassian products and advertisements, we will personalize your experience and tailor our communications and offers to you.\nTo opt out of this personalization, please contact privacy@atlassian.com.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For research and development</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp.\nWe are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful.&nbsp.\nWe use information and&nbsp;collective learnings (including feedback)&nbsp;about how people use our Services to troubleshoot, to identify trends, usage, activity patterns, and areas for integration and&nbsp;to improve our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public.&nbsp;For example, to&nbsp;improve the&nbsp;@mention feature, we automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to&nbsp;surface the most relevant connections for users.\nWe automatically analyze and aggregate frequently used search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature.&nbsp;In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features, to better integrate the Services you use, or to provide you with insights based on how others use our Services.\nWe also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>To communicate with you about the Services</strong>\n</em>: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.&nbsp.\nWe send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are&nbsp;@mentioned on a page or ticket,&nbsp;when a task is&nbsp;assigned to you, or when you are added to a Trello board.\nDepending on your chosen method of contact, we may send you SMS notifications or call you if you are on-call for incident alerts in Opsgenie.&nbsp;We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.&nbsp.\nFor example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier.&nbsp.\nWe also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.&nbsp;These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out&nbsp;of them.&nbsp.\nIf an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: </strong>\n</em>We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies' websites and applications.&nbsp.\nThese communications may be informed by audits of interactions (like counting ad impressions), and are&nbsp;aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including&nbsp;information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp.\nWe also communicate with you about new Services, product offers, promotions, and contests.&nbsp.\nYou can control whether you receive these communications as described below under \"Opt-out of communications.\"</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Customer support</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.&nbsp;Where you give us express permission to do so, we share information with a third party expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For safety and security</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to detect, prevent, and respond to potential or actual security incidents and to monitor and protect against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, including violations&nbsp;of Service policies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights</em>:</strong>&nbsp;Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and&nbsp;disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With your&nbsp;consent</strong>\n</em>: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.&nbsp.\nThe legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them.&nbsp;This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>\n<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote&nbsp;the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>\n<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.\nor</li>\n<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.&nbsp.\nWhere we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g.\nyour employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> How we share information we collect <p>We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you.&nbsp.\nThis means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties.&nbsp.\nWe share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below,&nbsp;including in connection with possible business transfers.\nWe are not in the

certain information about you with other Service users.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For collaboration</strong>\n</em>: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator&nbsp;(if applicable) select.&nbsp.\nSome of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you comment&nbsp;on a Confluence page or Jira issue, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or issue understand who made the comment.\nSimilarly, when you publish a Confluence page, your name is displayed as the author of that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.&nbsp.\nYour team\u2019s story status in Jira Align or certain profile information when you are listed in an Opsgenie on-call schedule, can be seen by other users with certain role permissions or team assignments.\nPlease be aware that some aspects of the Services like Confluence pages,&nbsp;Bitbucket repositories, or Trello boards&nbsp;can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted in that space,&nbsp;including information about you, can be publicly viewed,&nbsp;indexed by, and returned in search results of search engines.&nbsp.\nYou can confirm whether certain Service properties are publicly visible from within the Services or by contacting the relevant administrator.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Managed accounts&nbsp;and administrators</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;If you register or access the Services using an email address with a

about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization\u2019s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain.&nbsp.\nIf you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Community Forums</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp.\nOur websites offer&nbsp;publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and

function properly.\nWidgets and social media features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Services.\nYou should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With your consent</strong>\n</em>: We share information about you with third

the testimonial.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws.\nEnforcement of Our Rights</strong>\n</em>: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,&nbsp;including to

includes companies that own or operate the Services listed here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Business Transfers</strong>\n</em>: We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.\nYou will be notified via email and/or a

and how we store your information, please see the Atlassian&nbsp;Trust, Trello Trust,&nbsp;and Jira Align Trust pages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet,&nbsp;we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care,&nbsp;is&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;safe&nbsp;from&nbsp;intrusion by others.</p>\n<p>If you use our server or data center Services, responsibility for securing storage and access to the information you put into the Services rests with you and not Atlassian.\nWe strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of information transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How long we keep information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.&nbsp.\nAfter such time, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Account information</strong>\n</em>: We&nbsp;retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.&nbsp.\nWe also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.\nWhere we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information&nbsp;to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Information you share on the Services</strong>\n</em>: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.&nbsp.\nFor example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided,&nbsp;but when requested details that can identify you will be removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Managed&nbsp;accounts</strong>\n</em>: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.&nbsp.\nFor more information, see \"Managed accounts and administrators\" above.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Marketing&nbsp;information</strong>\n</em>: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Atlassian account.&nbsp.\nWe retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p> How to access and control your information <p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information.\nBelow is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any

these requests.&nbsp.\nYou can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account.&nbsp;Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see \"Notice to End Users\" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below&nbsp;to request assistance.</p>\n<p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.&nbsp.\nWhere you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.&nbsp.\nIf you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Access and update your information</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;Our Services and related documentation&nbsp;(see Atlassian Documentation and Trello Help) give you the

settings.\nPlease note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Request that we stop using your information</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time.\nYou can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.&nbsp.\nIf there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the

already asserted control over your account or access to the Services, you can update the email address associated with your account through your account settings in your&nbsp;profile.&nbsp.\nOnce an

approval.</p>\n<p>Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator\u2019s organizational policies for more information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>California

repositories are public (meaning that anyone coming to the Bitbucket website can view them) or private (meaning that access to those repositories will be limited to those who have permission to access the repositories).\nFor each public repository that you maintain, you must indicate the license under which you are making the contents of the repository available to others, as well as the license under which you will accept contributions to your repository.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nStorage Rules.</strong>\u00a0The Bitbucket Cloud documentation sets forth pre-defined storage limits on Your Data in Bitbucket Cloud.\nWe enforce those parameters to ensure that you do not use Bitbucket Cloud in a way that consumes a disproportionate amount of system resources (CPU\u2019s, memory, disk space, bandwidth, etc.) or that would adversely impact the performance or operation of Bitbucket Cloud for other Bitbucket Cloud users.\nSimilarly, since Bitbucket Cloud is designed to be used as a source code repository, we reserve the right to remove any other content (such as music or video), particularly if the content is consuming a disproportionate amount of storage.\nPlease note that, since we do not maintain access to your repositories, any removal of Your Data under Section 5.5 (Removals and Suspension) of the Agreement means removal of the entire repository in which the offending data resides, not just the offending portions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nAccessing Repositories.</strong> If you are accessing code in someone else\u2019s repository, you should carefully read all the licenses applicable to that repository before using or contributing any code.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL CODE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH BITBUCKET CLOUD IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ACCOUNT OWNER CONTROLLING THE PARTICULAR REPOSITORY.\nWE ARE NOT THE LICENSOR OF ANY THIRD PARTY CODE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH BITBUCKET CLOUD AND TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR SUCH CODE.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nGranting Permissions.\u00a0</strong>Be careful about granting permissions to your repositories.\nOnce you grant such permissions, we will not be able to prevent those users from taking the actions allowed under those permissions, even if you don\u2019t approve of those actions.\nBe especially careful about granting administrative access to your repositories, as some of those actions may be irreversible.\nFor example, if you grant someone permission that allows them to move content in your repository to another account, we will not be able to reach into that other user\u2019s account without their permission to recover the data, as we are not in a position to arbitrate disputes among our users.\nIn that case, your only recourse may be requesting a takedown under our policy regarding\u00a0Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations\u00a0or pursuing legal action against the other user directly.</p> ", "created_at": "2019-01-01 04:41:25.51305", "updated_at": "2019-01-01

<strong>\u201cTerms\u201d</strong>) describe your rights and responsibilities as a customer of our Cloud Products.\nAs applicable to the specific Cloud Product, if you are being invited or added to a Cloud Product set up by an Atlassian customer, the\u00a0User Notice\u00a0governs your access and use of the Cloud Product (and not these Terms).\u00a0 These Terms are between you and the Atlassian entity that owns or operates the Cloud Product that you are using or accessing listed here\u00a0(<strong>\u201cAtlassian\u201d</strong>,\u00a0<strong>\u201cwe\u201d</strong> or <strong>\u201cus\u201d</strong>).\u00a0 <strong>\u201cYou\u201d</strong> means the entity you represent in accepting these Terms or, if that does not apply, you individually.\u00a0 If you are accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to these Terms.\n(ii) you have read and

do not click \u201cI agree\u201d (or similar button or checkbox) that is presented to you.\u00a0 <strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU SIGN UP FOR A CLOUD PRODUCT USING AN EMAIL ADDRESS FROM YOUR EMPLOYER

cover.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.1.</strong>\u00a0<u>Cloud Products</u>.\nThese Terms govern our Cloud Products, related Support, and Additional Services.\nThese Terms include Our Policies (including our Privacy Policy), the Product-Specific Terms, and your Orders.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.2.</strong>\u00a0<u>Product-Specific Terms</u>.\u00a0Some Cloud Products may be subject to additional terms specific to that product as set forth in the Product-Specific Terms.\nBy accessing or using a product covered by the Product-Specific Terms, you also agree to the Product-Specific Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.3.</strong>\u00a0<u>Software Products Not Covered</u>.\nThese Terms do not apply to our downloadable software products (currently designated as \u201cServer\u201d and \u201cData Center\u201d deployments), use of which requires a separate license agreement with us.\nFor clarity, however, any client software (e.g., a desktop or mobile application) we provide as part of the Cloud Products themselves remains subject to these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nHow Cloud Products are administered.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1.</strong>\n<u>Administrators</u>.\nThrough the Cloud Products, you may be able to specify certain End Users as Administrators, who will have important rights and controls over your use of Cloud Products and End User Accounts.\nThis may include making Orders for Cloud Products or enabling Apps (which may incur fees).\ncreating, de-provisioning, monitoring or modifying End User Accounts, and setting End User usage permissions.\nand managing access to Your Data by End Users or others.\nAdministrators may also take over management of accounts previously registered using an email address belonging to your domain (which become \u201cmanaged accounts\u201d, as described in our Documentation).\nWithout limiting Section 2.4 (Responsibility for End Users), which fully applies to Administrators, you are responsible for whom you allow to become Administrators and any actions they take, including as described above.\nYou agree that our responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Cloud Products for you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2.</strong>\u00a0<u>Reseller as Administrator</u>.\nIf you order Cloud Products through a Reseller, then you are responsible for determining whether the Reseller may serve as an Administrator and for any related rights or obligations in your applicable agreement with the Reseller.\u00a0 As between you and Atlassian, you are solely responsible for any access by Reseller to your accounts or your other End User Accounts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3.</strong>\u00a0<u>End User Consent</u>.\u00a0You will provide all required disclosures to and will obtain and maintain all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) Administrators to have the access described in these Terms and the Privacy Policy.\nand (ii) Atlassian\u2019s provision of the Cloud Products to Administrators and End Users.\nYou will provide evidence of such consents upon our reasonable request.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4.</strong>\u00a0<u>Responsibility for End Users</u>.\nOur Cloud Products have various user onboarding flows.\nSome Cloud Products require users to be designated by Administrators.\nsome allow users to sign up for individual accounts which can become associated with teams or organizations at a later time.\nand some may allow users to invite other users.\nYou are responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Cloud Product you use and for controlling whom you allow to become an End User.\nIf payment is required for End Users to use or access a Cloud Product, then we are only required to provide the Cloud Products to those End Users for whom you have paid the applicable fees, and only such End Users are permitted to access and use the Cloud Products.\nSome Cloud Products may allow you to designate different types of End Users (for example, Jira Service Desk distinguishes between \u201cagents\u201d and \u201ccustomers\u201d), in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of End User.\nYou are responsible for compliance with these Terms by all End Users, including for any payment obligations.\nPlease note that you are responsible for the activities of all your End Users, including Orders they may place and how End Users use Your Data, even if those End Users are not from your organization or domain.\nWe may display our User Notice\u00a0to End Users at sign up, account creation, Cloud Product registration, or in-product.\nIf you use\u00a0single sign-on (SSO) for identity management of your Cloud Product(s) such that End Users will bypass these screens and our User Notice, you are responsible for displaying our User Notice\u00a0to End Users and for any damages resulting from your failure to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.5.</strong>\u00a0<u>Credentials</u>.\u00a0You must require that all End Users keep their user IDs and passwords for the Cloud Products strictly confidential and do not share such information with any unauthorized person.\nUser IDs are granted to individual, named persons and may not be shared.\nYou are responsible for any and all actions taken using End User Accounts and passwords, and you agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of which you become aware.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.6.</strong>\u00a0<u>Age Requirement for End Users</u>.\u00a0The Cloud Products are not intended for, and should not be used by, anyone under the age of 16.\nYou are responsible for ensuring that all End Users are at least 16 years old.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.7.</strong>\u00a0<u>Domain Name Ownership</u>.\u00a0Where you are required to specify a domain for the operation of a Cloud Product or certain Cloud Product features, we may verify that you own or control that domain.\nIf you do not own or control the domain you specify, then we will have no obligation to provide you with the Cloud Product or Cloud Product features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nWhat's included in your Cloud Product subscriptions.\nwhat are the restrictions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.1.</strong>\n<u>Access to Cloud Products</u>.\u00a0Subject to these Terms and during the applicable Subscription Term, you may access and use the Cloud Products for your own business purposes or personal use, as applicable, all in accordance with these Terms, the applicable Order and the Documentation.\nThis includes the right, as part of your authorized use of the Cloud Products, to download and use the client software associated with the Cloud Products.\nThe rights granted to you in this Section 3.1 are non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2.</strong>\n<u>Support</u>.\u00a0During the Subscription Term, we will provide Support for the Cloud Products in accordance with the Support Policy, Enterprise Support and Services Policy (to the extent applicable), and the applicable Order.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.3.</strong>\n<u>Restrictions</u>.\u00a0Except as otherwise expressly permitted in these Terms, you will not: (a) reproduce, modify, adapt or create derivative works of the Cloud Products.\n(b) rent, lease, distribute, sell, sublicense, transfer or provide access to the Cloud Products to a third party.\n(c) use the Cloud Products for the benefit of any third party.\n(d) incorporate any Cloud Products into a product or service you provide to a third party.\n(e) interfere with or otherwise circumvent mechanisms in the Cloud Products intended to limit your use.\n(f) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, translate or otherwise seek to obtain or derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or non-public APIs to any Cloud Products, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law (and then only upon advance notice to us).\n(g) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in any Cloud Product.\n(h) use the Cloud Products for competitive analysis or to build competitive products.\n(i) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Cloud Products.\nor (j) encourage or assist any third party to do any of the foregoing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nOur security and data privacy

distribute, perform, export, and display\u00a0Your Data.\nSolely to the extent that reformatting Your Data for display in a Cloud Product constitutes a modification or derivative work, the foregoing license also includes the right to make modifications and derivative works.\nWe may also access your accounts, End User Accounts, and your Cloud Products with End User permission in order to respond to your support requests.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2.</strong>\n<u>Your Data Compliance Obligations</u>.\u00a0You and your use of Cloud Products (including use by your End Users) must comply at all times with these Terms, the\u00a0Acceptable Use Policy\u00a0and all Laws.\nYou represent and warrant that: (i) you have obtained all necessary rights, releases and permissions to submit all Your Data to the

obligation to monitor any content uploaded to the Cloud Products.\nNonetheless, if we deem such action necessary based on your violation of these Terms, including Our Policies, or in response to takedown requests that we receive following our guidelines for\u00a0Reporting Copyright and Trademark Violations, we may (1) remove Your Data from the Cloud Products or (2) suspend your access to the Cloud Products.\nWe will use reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of removals and suspensions when practicable, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the Cloud Product or other users, we may suspend your access or remove Your Data immediately without notice.\nWe have no liability to you for removing or deleting Your Data from or suspending your access to any Cloud Products as described in this Section 5.5.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nUsing third-party products with the Cloud Products.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.1.</strong>\u00a0<u>Third-Party Products</u>.\nYou (including your End Users) may choose to use or procure other third party products or services in connection with the Cloud Products, including Third Party Apps (see Section 6.2 (Marketplace Apps)) or implementation, customization, training or other services.\nYour receipt or use of any third party products or services (and the third parties\u2019 use of any of Your Data) is subject to a separate agreement between you and the third party provider.\nIf you enable or use third party products or services with the Cloud Products (including Third Party Apps as referenced in Section 6.2 (Marketplace Apps)), we will allow the third party providers to access or use Your Data as required for the interoperation of their products and services with the Cloud Products.\nThis may include transmitting, transferring, modifying or deleting Your Data, or storing Your Data on systems belonging to the third party providers or other third parties.\nAny third party provider\u2019s use

PROVIDERS OR VENDORS.\u00a0</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2.</strong>\u00a0<u>Marketplace Apps</u>.\nAs further described in the Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use, the Atlassian Marketplace lists a variety of Apps that may be used with Cloud Products, including both Atlassian Apps and Third Party Apps.\nAtlassian Apps for Cloud Products are considered \u201cCloud Products\u201d under these Terms (unless we specify otherwise through the Atlassian Marketplace).\nThird Party Apps are not Cloud Products and remain subject to their own applicable Vendor Terms.\nWe may enable interoperation of the Cloud Products with Third Party Apps as set forth in Section 6.1 (Third-Party Products).\nThe terms <strong>\u201cApps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cAtlassian Apps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cThird Party Apps\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cVendor\u201d</strong> and <strong>\u201cVendor Terms\u201d</strong> are defined in the Atlassian Marketplace Terms of Use, which is a separate agreement

Our Deliverables provided to you only in connection with the Cloud Products, subject to the same usage rights and restrictions as for the Cloud Products.\nFor clarity, Our Deliverables are not considered Cloud Products, and any Cloud Products are not considered to be Our Deliverables.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.3.</strong>\n<u>Your Materials</u>.\u00a0You agree to provide us with reasonable access to Your Materials as reasonably necessary for our provision of Additional Services.\nIf you do not provide us with timely access to Your Materials, our performance of Additional Services will be excused until you do so.\nYou retain your rights in Your Materials, subject to our ownership of any Cloud Products, any of Our Deliverables or any of Our Technology underlying Your Materials.\nWe will use Your Materials solely for purposes of performing the Additional Services.\nYou represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights in Your Materials to provide them to us for such purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.4.</strong>\n<u>Training Not Covered</u>.\u00a0Your purchase, and our provision, of Training is subject to our Training Terms and Policies, which is a separate agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nBilling, renewals, and payment.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.1.</strong>\n<u>Monthly and Annual Plans</u>.\nExcept for No-Charge Products, all Cloud Products are offered either on a monthly subscription basis or an annual subscription basis.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.2.</strong>\n<u>Renewals</u>.\u00a0Except as otherwise specified in your Order, unless either party cancels your subscription prior to expiration of the current Subscription Term, your subscription will automatically renew for another Subscription Term of a period equal to your initial Subscription Term.\nYou will provide any notice of non-renewal through the means we designate, which may include account settings in the Cloud Products or contacting our support team.\nCancelling your subscription means that you will not be charged for the next billing cycle, but you will not receive any refunds or credits for amounts that have already been charged.\nAll renewals are subject to the applicable Cloud Product continuing to be offered and will be charged at the then-current rates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.3.</strong>\n<u>Adding Users</u>.\u00a0You may add users, increase storage limits, or otherwise increase your use of Cloud Products by placing a new Order or modifying an existing Order.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable Order, we will charge you for any increased use at our then-current rates, prorated for the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.4.</strong>\n<u>Payment</u>.\u00a0You will pay all fees in accordance with each Order, by the due dates and in the currency specified in the Order.\nIf a PO number is required in order for an invoice to be paid, then you must provide such PO number to Atlassian by emailing the PO number to accountsreceivable@atlassian.com.\nFor Additional Services provided at any non-Atlassian location, unless otherwise specified in your Order, you will reimburse us for our pre-approved travel, lodging and meal expenses, which we may charge as incurred.\nOther than as expressly set forth in Section 10 (Our return policy), 18.3 (Warranty Remedy), Section 20 (IP Indemnification) or Section 24 (Changes to these Terms), all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable.\nYou agree that we may bill your credit card or other payment method for renewals, additional users, overages to set limits or scopes of use, expenses, and unpaid fees, as applicable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.5.</strong>\n<u>Delivery</u>.\u00a0We will deliver the login instructions for Cloud Products to your\u00a0account or through other reasonable means no later than when we have received payment of the applicable fees.\nYou are responsible for accessing your account to determine that we have received payment and that your Order has been processed.\nAll deliveries under these Terms will be electronic.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nOur return policy.\u00a0</strong>As part of our commitment to customer satisfaction and without limiting the Performance Warranty in Section 18 (Warranties and Disclaimer), you may terminate your initial Order of a Cloud Product under these Terms, for no reason or any reason, by providing notice of termination to us no later than thirty (30) days after the Order date for such Cloud Product.\nIn the event you terminate your initial Order under this Section 10, at your request (which may be made through your account with us), we will refund you the amount paid under such Order.\nThis termination and refund right applies only to your initial Order of the Cloud Product and only if you exercise your termination right within the period specified above, and does not apply to Additional Services.\nYou understand that we may change this practice in the future in accordance with Section 24 (Changes to these Terms).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nTaxes not included.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.1.</strong>\n<u>Taxes</u>.\nYour fees under these Terms exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Cloud Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received.\nTo the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by us, you must pay to us the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under these Terms.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you have obtained an exemption from relevant taxes or duties as of the time such taxes or duties are levied or assessed, you may provide us with such exemption information, and we will use reasonable efforts to provide you with invoicing documents designed to enable you to obtain a refund or credit from the relevant revenue authority, if such a refund or credit is available.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.</strong>\n<u>Withholding Taxes</u>.\u00a0You will pay all fees net of any applicable withholding taxes.\nYou and we will work together to avoid any withholding tax if exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available.\nIf we qualify for a tax exemption, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, we will provide you with reasonable documentary proof.\nYou will provide us reasonable evidence that you have paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nIf you purchased through a Reseller.\n</strong> If you make any purchases through an\u00a0authorized partner or reseller of Atlassian (<strong>\u201cReseller\u201d</strong>):</p>\n<p>(a)\u00a0Instead of paying us, you will pay the applicable amounts to the Reseller, as agreed between you and the Reseller.\nWe may suspend or terminate your rights to use Cloud Products if we do not receive the corresponding payment from the Reseller.</p>\n<p>(b)\u00a0Your order details (e.g., the Cloud Products you are entitled to use, the number of End Users, the Subscription Term, etc.) will be as stated in the Order placed with us by the Reseller on your behalf, and Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such Order as communicated to us.</p>\n<p>(c)\u00a0If you are entitled to a refund under these Terms, then unless we otherwise specify, we will refund any applicable fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the appropriate amounts to you.</p>\n<p>(d)\u00a0Resellers are not authorized to modify these Terms or make any promises or commitments on our behalf, and we are not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth in these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nNo contingencies on other products of future functionality.\u00a0</strong>You acknowledge that the Cloud Products and Additional Services referenced in an Order are being purchased separately from any of our other products or services.\nPayment obligations for any products or services are not contingent on the purchase or use of any of our other products (and for clarity, any purchases of Cloud Products and Additional Services are separate and not contingent on each other, even if listed on the same Order).\nYou agree that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features (including future availability of any Cloud Products beyond the current Subscription Term), or dependent on any oral or written public comments we make regarding future functionality or features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nEvaluations, trials, and betas.</strong> We may offer certain Cloud Products (including some Atlassian Apps) to you at no charge, including free accounts, trial use and Beta Versions as defined below (collectively, <strong>\u201cNo-Charge Products\u201d</strong>).\nYour use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted during the Subscription Term we designate (or, if not designated, until terminated in accordance with these Terms).\nExcept as otherwise set forth in this Section 14, the terms and conditions of these Terms governing Cloud Products, including Section 3.3 (Restrictions), fully apply to No-Charge Products.\nWe may modify or terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you.\nYou understand that any pre-release and beta Cloud Products, and any pre-release and beta features within generally available Cloud Products, that we make available (collectively, \u201c<strong>Beta Versions</strong>\u201d) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Cloud Products.\nWe make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available.\nIn some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 14.\nAll information regarding the characteristics, features or performance of any No-Charge Products (including Beta Versions) constitutes our Confidential Information.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support, warranty and indemnity obligations.\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THESE TERMS, OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU IN RESPECT OF NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS WILL BE US$100.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.\nIP Rights in the Cloud Products and Feedback.</strong> Cloud Products are made available on a limited access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as \u201cpurchase\u201d or \u201csale\u201d.\nWe and our licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to Our Technology (including the Cloud Products).\nFrom time to time, you may choose to submit Feedback to us.\nWe may in connection with any of our products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.\nNo Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in these Terms limits our right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products or services, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nConfidentiality.</strong> Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how and business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party (<strong>\u201cReceiving Party\u201d</strong>) by the disclosing party (<strong>\"Disclosing Party\"</strong>) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (<strong>\u201cConfidential Information\u201d</strong>), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.\nAny of Our Technology and any performance information relating to the Cloud Products will be deemed our Confidential Information without any marking or further designation.\nExcept as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under these Terms.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know, provided that they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 16 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by them with the terms of this Section 16.\nThe Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations will not apply to information which the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information.\n(ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party.\n(iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation.\nor (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.\nThe Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant to a regulation, law or court order (but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party).\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nTerm and Termination.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.1.</strong>\n<u>Term</u>.\nThese Terms are

successor.\nor (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors\u2019 arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against

terminate these Terms (including all Orders) at any time for any reason upon written notice to us, but, unless you are exercising your right to terminate early pursuant to Section 10 (Our return policy), upon any such termination (i) you will not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees and (ii) if you have not already paid all applicable fees for the then-current Subscription Term or related services period (as applicable), any such fees that are outstanding will become immediately due and payable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.4.</strong>\n<u>Effects of Termination</u>.\u00a0Upon any expiration or termination of these Terms, you must cease using all Cloud Products and delete (or at our request, return) all Confidential Information or other materials of ours in your possession, including on any third-party systems operated on your behalf.\nYou will certify such deletion upon our request.\nYou will not have access to Your Data (and we may delete all of Your Data unless legally prohibited) after expiration or termination of these Terms (or its applicable Subscription Term), so you should make sure to export Your Data using the functionality of the Cloud Products during the applicable Subscription Term.\nIf you terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 17.2 (Termination for Cause), we will refund you any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term after the effective date of termination.\nIf we terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 17.2 (Termination for Cause), you will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the then-current Subscription Term after the effective date of termination.\nIn no event will termination relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us for the period prior to the effective date of termination.\nExcept where an exclusive remedy may be specified in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any remedy, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under these Terms, by law or otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.5.</strong>\n<u>Survival</u>.\u00a0The following provisions will survive any termination or expiration of

similar harmful materials into the Cloud Products (but we are not responsible for harmful materials submitted by you or End Users) (the <strong>\u201cPerformance Warranty\u201d</strong>).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.3.</strong>\n<u>Warranty Remedy</u>.\u00a0We will use commercially reasonable efforts, at no charge to you, to correct reported non-conformities with the Performance Warranty.\nIf we determine corrections to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable Subscription Term.\nIn this case, you will receive a refund of any fees you have pre-paid for use of the Cloud Product for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.\nThe Performance Warranty will not apply: (i) unless you make a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which you first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the non-conformity was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party products, software, services or equipment or (iii) to No-Charge Products.\nOur sole liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, for any breach of the Performance Warranty are set forth in this Section 18.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.4.</strong>\n<u>WARRANTY

THAT TRANSMISSIONS OF YOUR DATA WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE OR THAT UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTIES WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO DEFEAT OUR SECURITY MEASURES OR THOSE OF OUR THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.\nWE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.\nYOU MAY HAVE

brought against you by a third party alleging that the Cloud Products, when used as authorized under these Terms, infringe a patent right granted in the United States, Australia or a member nation of the European Union or a copyright registered in such a jurisdiction (a <strong>\u201cClaim\u201d</strong>), and we will indemnify you and hold you harmless against any damages and costs finally awarded on the Claim by a court of competent jurisdiction or agreed to via settlement executed by us (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees), provided that we have received from you: (a) prompt written notice of the Claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for us to respond without prejudice).\n(b) reasonable assistance in the defense and investigation of the Claim, including

Products is (or in your opinion is likely to be) enjoined, whether by court order or by settlement, or if we determine such actions are reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, we may, at our option and in our discretion: (i) procure the right for your continued use of the Cloud Product in accordance with these Terms.\n(ii) substitute a substantially functionally similar Cloud Product.\nor (iii) terminate your right to continue using the Cloud Product and refund any prepaid amounts for the terminated portion of the Subscription Term.\nOur indemnification obligations above do not apply:

Cloud Product is modified by any party other than us, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification.\n(3) if the Cloud Product is used in combination with any

is limited to clickstream data&nbsp;about how you interact with and use features in the Services, in addition to content-related information described in \"Content you provide through&nbsp;our products,\" above.&nbsp.\nServer and data center administrators can disable our collection of this information from the Services via the administrator settings or prevent this information from being shared with us by blocking transmission at the local network level.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Device and Connection Information</strong>\n</em>: We collect information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other devices you use to access the Services.\nThis device information includes your connection type and settings when you install, access, update, or use our Services.\nWe also collect information through your device about your operating system, browser type, IP address, URLs of referring/exit pages, device identifiers, and crash data.\nWe use your IP address and/or country preference in order to approximate your location to provide you with a better Service experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;How much of this information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services.&nbsp.\nServer&nbsp;and data center Service administrators can disable collection of this information via the administrator settings or prevent this information from being shared with us by blocking transmission at the local network level.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong>\n</em>: Atlassian and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g., web beacons, device identifiers and pixels) to provide functionality and to recognize you across different Services and devices.\nFor more information, please see our Cookies and Tracking Notice, which includes information on how to control or opt out&nbsp;of these cookies and tracking technologies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information we receive from other sources</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We receive information about you from other Service&nbsp;users, from third-party services, from our related companies, social media platforms, public databases, and from our business and channel partners.&nbsp;We may combine this information with information we collect through other means described above.\nThis helps us to update and improve our records, identify new customers, create more personalized advertising and suggest services that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Other users of the Services</strong>\n</em>: Other users of our Services may provide information about you when they submit content through the Services.&nbsp;For example, you may be mentioned in a Jira&nbsp;issue or paged via an Opsgenie incident opened by someone else,&nbsp;a team member may upload content about you to a Trello board, or your team\u2019s story status may be discussed in Jira Align.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also receive your email address from other Service users when they provide it in order to invite you to the Services.&nbsp.\nSimilarly, an administrator may provide your contact information when they designate you as the billing or technical contact on your company's account or when they designate you as an administrator.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Other services you link to your account</strong>\n</em>: We receive information about you when you or your administrator integrate&nbsp;third-party apps, like Power-UPs, or link a third-party service with our Services.&nbsp;For example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you.\nYou or your administrator may also integrate our Services with other services you use, such as to allow you to access, store, share and edit certain content from a third-party through our Services.&nbsp.\nFor example, you may authorize our Services to access, display and store files from a third-party document-sharing service within the Services interface.&nbsp;Or you may authorize our Services to connect with a third-party calendaring service&nbsp;or to sync a contact list or address book so that your meetings and connections are available to you through the Services, so you can invite others to collaborate with you on our Services or so your organization can limit access to certain users.&nbsp;Your administrator may also&nbsp;authorize our Services to connect with a third party reporting service so your organization can review how the Services are being used.&nbsp;The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service.\nYou should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Atlassian Companies</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;We receive information about you from companies that are owned or operated by Atlassian, in accordance with&nbsp;their terms and policies.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Atlassian Partners</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp.\nWe work with a global network of partners who provide consulting, implementation, training and other services around our products.&nbsp.\nSome of these partners also help us to market and promote our Services, generate leads for us, and resell our Services.&nbsp.\nWe receive information from these partners, such as billing information, billing and technical contact information, company name, what Atlassian Services&nbsp;you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Other Partners</strong>\n</em>: We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from third-party partners, such as&nbsp;advertising and market research partners who provide us with information about your interest in and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Third Party Providers</strong>\n</em>: We may receive information about you from third party providers of business information and publicly available sources (like&nbsp;social media platforms), including physical mail addresses, job titles, email addresses, phone numbers, intent data (or user behavior data), IP addresses and social media profiles, for the purposes of targeted advertising of products that may interest you, delivering personalized communications, event promotion, and profiling.</p> How we use information we collect <p>How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us.&nbsp.\nBelow are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>To provide the Services and personalize your experience</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate,&nbsp;maintain, and improve&nbsp;the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we use the name and picture you provide&nbsp;in your&nbsp;account to identify you to other Service users.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;Services also include&nbsp;tailored features that&nbsp;personalize your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to collaborate effectively with others&nbsp;by automatically analyzing the activities of your team to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you and your team.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may use your stated job title and activity to return search results we think are relevant to your job function.&nbsp.\nWe also use information about you to connect you with other team members seeking your subject matter expertise.&nbsp;We may use your email domain to infer your affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize the content and experience you receive on our websites.&nbsp;Where you&nbsp;use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another&nbsp;or to present relevant product information as you travel across our websites.&nbsp;Based on your interactions with different Atlassian products and advertisements, we will personalize your experience and tailor our communications and offers to you.\nTo opt out of this personalization, please contact privacy@atlassian.com.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For research and development</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp.\nWe are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful.&nbsp.\nWe use information and&nbsp;collective learnings (including feedback)&nbsp;about how people use our Services to troubleshoot, to identify trends, usage, activity patterns, and areas for integration and&nbsp;to improve our Services and to develop new products, features and technologies that benefit our users and the public.&nbsp;For example, to&nbsp;improve the&nbsp;@mention feature, we automatically analyze recent interactions among users and how often they @mention one another to&nbsp;surface the most relevant connections for users.\nWe automatically analyze and aggregate frequently used search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature.&nbsp;In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features, to better integrate the Services you use, or to provide you with insights based on how others use our Services.\nWe also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>To communicate with you about the Services</strong>\n</em>: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.&nbsp.\nWe send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are&nbsp;@mentioned on a page or ticket,&nbsp;when a task is&nbsp;assigned to you, or when you are added to a Trello board.\nDepending on your chosen method of contact, we may send you SMS notifications or call you if you are on-call for incident alerts in Opsgenie.&nbsp;We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.&nbsp.\nFor example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier.&nbsp.\nWe also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.&nbsp;These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out&nbsp;of them.&nbsp.\nIf an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: </strong>\n</em>We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies' websites and applications.&nbsp.\nThese communications may be informed by audits of interactions (like counting ad impressions), and are&nbsp;aimed at driving engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including&nbsp;information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp.\nWe also communicate with you about new Services, product offers, promotions, and contests.&nbsp.\nYou can control whether you receive these communications as described below under \"Opt-out of communications.\"</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Customer support</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.&nbsp;Where you give us express permission to do so, we share information with a third party expert for the purpose of responding to support-related requests.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For safety and security</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to detect, prevent, and respond to potential or actual security incidents and to monitor and protect against other malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity, including violations&nbsp;of Service policies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights</em>:</strong>&nbsp;Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and&nbsp;disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With your&nbsp;consent</strong>\n</em>: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Legal bases for processing (for EEA users)</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.&nbsp.\nThe legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them.&nbsp;This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services;</li>\n<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote&nbsp;the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>\n<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.\nor</li>\n<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.&nbsp.\nWhere we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g.\nyour employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> How we share information we collect <p>We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you.&nbsp.\nThis means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties.&nbsp.\nWe share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below,&nbsp;including in connection with possible business transfers.\nWe are not in the business of selling&nbsp;information about you to advertisers or other third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing with other Service users&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For collaboration</strong>\n</em>: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator&nbsp;(if applicable) select.&nbsp.\nSome of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you comment&nbsp;on a Confluence page or Jira issue, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or issue understand who made the comment.\nSimilarly, when you publish a Confluence page, your name is displayed as the author of that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.&nbsp.\nYour team\u2019s story status in Jira Align or certain profile information when you are listed in an Opsgenie on-call schedule, can be seen by other users with certain role permissions or team assignments.\nPlease be aware that some aspects of the Services like Confluence pages,&nbsp;Bitbucket repositories, or Trello boards&nbsp;can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted in that space,&nbsp;including information about you, can be publicly viewed,&nbsp;indexed by, and returned in search results of search engines.&nbsp.\nYou can confirm whether certain Service properties are publicly visible from within the Services or by contacting the relevant administrator.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Managed accounts&nbsp;and administrators</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization or associate that email address with your existing account, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization\u2019s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain.&nbsp.\nIf you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Community Forums</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp.\nOur websites offer&nbsp;publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and wikis (e.g.,&nbsp;Atlassian Community,&nbsp;Atlassian Developer Community,&nbsp;Trello Community, and Trello Inspiration).&nbsp;You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.&nbsp.\nYour posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account.&nbsp;We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services.&nbsp;To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below.\nIn some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we&nbsp;will&nbsp;let you know if we are unable to and why.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing with third parties</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We share information with third parties that help us&nbsp;operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Service Providers</strong>\n</em>: We&nbsp;work with third-party service providers&nbsp;to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to&nbsp;access or use information about you.&nbsp.\nIf a service provider needs to&nbsp;access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including appropriate security and confidentiality&nbsp;procedures designed to protect your information.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Atlassian Partners</strong>\n</em>: We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, support, and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services.\nWe may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations.&nbsp.\nWe may also share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Third Party Apps</strong>\n</em>: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to&nbsp;add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps within the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like&nbsp;your name and email address,&nbsp;and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.&nbsp.\nIf you are an administrator, or a&nbsp;technical or billing contact listed on an account, we share your details with the third-party app provider upon installation.&nbsp;Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices.&nbsp;If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Links to Third Party Sites</strong>\n</em>: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours.\nIf you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one.\nWe encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Third Party Services:</strong>\n</em>&nbsp;We may offer you the ability to interact with or share information with third parties through the Services.\nFor example, we may offer users the ability to log in to the Services via a third-party service like Google, access embedded maps through Google Maps or interact with social media networks via links on the Services.\nWhen you intentionally interact with these third parties, we may share certain information with those third parties or receive information with those third parties, consistent with your privacy settings on the third-party service.\nSuch information may include contact information, identification, and demographic information, and device information and identifiers.\nYou should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Third Party Widgets</strong>\n</em>: Some&nbsp;of our services contain widgets and social media features, such&nbsp;as the Twitter \"tweet\" button or Facebook \"like\" button.\nThese widgets and features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nWidgets and social media features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our Services.\nYou should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand how those third-parties may use your information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With your consent</strong>\n</em>: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so.&nbsp.\nFor example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites.\nWith your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws.\nEnforcement of Our Rights</strong>\n</em>: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,&nbsp;including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our&nbsp;products and services, (d) protect Atlassian, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person.\nFor more information on how we respond to government requests, see our Guidelines for Law Enforcement and our Transparency Report.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing with affiliated companies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We share information we collect with affiliated companies and, in some cases, with prospective affiliates.&nbsp.\nAffiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us.&nbsp.\nThe protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we share in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Atlassian companies</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;We share information we have about you with other Atlassian corporate affiliates in order to operate and improve products and services and to offer other Atlassian affiliated services to you.&nbsp;This includes companies that own or operate the Services listed here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Business Transfers</strong>\n</em>: We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.\nYou will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on the Services if a transaction takes place, as well as any choices you may have regarding your information.</p> How we store and secure information we collect <p>\n<strong>Information storage and security</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use industry standard technical and organizational measures to secure the information we store.&nbsp;For more information on where and how we store your information, please see the Atlassian&nbsp;Trust, Trello Trust,&nbsp;and Jira Align Trust pages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet,&nbsp;we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care,&nbsp;is&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;safe&nbsp;from&nbsp;intrusion by others.</p>\n<p>If you use our server or data center Services, responsibility for securing storage and access to the information you put into the Services rests with you and not Atlassian.\nWe strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of information transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How long we keep information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.&nbsp.\nAfter such time, we will either delete or de-identify your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Account information</strong>\n</em>: We&nbsp;retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.&nbsp.\nWe also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.\nWhere we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information&nbsp;to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Information you share on the Services</strong>\n</em>: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.&nbsp.\nFor example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided,&nbsp;but when requested details that can identify you will be removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Managed&nbsp;accounts</strong>\n</em>: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.&nbsp.\nFor more information, see \"Managed accounts and administrators\" above.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Marketing&nbsp;information</strong>\n</em>: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Atlassian account.&nbsp.\nWe retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p> How to access and control your information <p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information.\nBelow is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Choices</strong>:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format.&nbsp.\nBelow, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.&nbsp.\nYou can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account.&nbsp;Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see \"Notice to End Users\" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below&nbsp;to request assistance.</p>\n<p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.&nbsp.\nWhere you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.&nbsp.\nIf you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Access and update your information</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;Our Services and related documentation&nbsp;(see Atlassian Documentation and Trello Help) give you the

the editing tools associated with that content.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Deactivate your&nbsp;account</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account.\nIf you can deactivate your own account, that setting is&nbsp;available to you in your account settings.\nOtherwise, please contact your administrator.\nIf you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact the appropriate support team (see&nbsp;Atlassian, Jira Align, or Trello support pages).&nbsp.\nPlease be aware that&nbsp;deactivating your account does not delete your information.\nyour information remains visible to&nbsp;other&nbsp;Service users based on your past participation within the Services.&nbsp.\nFor more information on how to delete your information, see below.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Delete your information</strong>\n</em>: Our Services and related documentation&nbsp;(see Atlassian Documentation and Trello Help) give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service.\nFor example, you can remove content that contains information about you using the key word search and editing tools associated with that content, and you can remove certain profile information within your profile settings.\nPlease note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Request that we stop using your information</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time.\nYou can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request.&nbsp.\nIf there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable).&nbsp;&nbsp;If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Opt out of&nbsp;communications</strong>\n</em>:&nbsp;You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences&nbsp;within your&nbsp;Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.&nbsp.\nEven after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our&nbsp;Services.\nYou can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings.&nbsp;Please note, you will continue to receive generic ads.</p>\n<p>You may be able to opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.\nFor more

Notice.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Send \"Do Not Track\" Signals</strong>\n</em>: Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.\nBecause there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.\nYou can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us&nbsp;as described
