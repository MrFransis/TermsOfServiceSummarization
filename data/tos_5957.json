from or relating to these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this agreement to arbitration (collectively, \u201cCovered Disputes\u201d) will be settled by binding arbitration in the U.S.\nState of California administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with its International Arbitration Rules in effect on the date thereof.\n<p>Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60 days\u2019 advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration.\nHalloweenville will provide such notice by mail or e-mail using the contact information on file with

administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules.\nIf, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be cost-prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, Halloweenville will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive for you.\nIf the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Halloweenville for all fees associated with the arbitration that Halloweenville paid on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p>A single arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted in the English language.\nThe arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives.\nThe arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision must be with written explanation and remain confidential.</p>\n<p>Halloweenville and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only.\n<strong>Neither Halloweenville nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private-attorney action and the arbitrator will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis.</strong> If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this Section 10 is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration).\nRegardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred.\nFor purposes of this Section 10, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\nsec.\n1-16
