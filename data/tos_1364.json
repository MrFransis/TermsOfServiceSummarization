responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications.\nUse of the Service by User following such notification constitutes User's acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified.\n</p>\n<p> User certifies to Brilliant that if User is an individual (i.e., not a corporation) User is at least 13 years of age (provided that, if User is located in a state in which 13 is under the age of majority, then User represents he/she has the legal consent of a legal guardian to enter this Agreement).\nUser also certifies that User is legally permitted to use the Service and takes full responsibility for the selection and use of the Service.\nThis Agreement is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Service is revoked in such jurisdictions.\n</p> FEES AND PAYMENT.\n<p> The basic Service is free to users, but if User elects to upgrade to a subscription membership or any of our other paid features, the following terms below shall apply.\nBrilliant reserves the right to change its prices at any time.\n</p> A.\nBilling and Payment.\n<p> Brilliant bills users through an online account for use of the Service.\nUser agrees to pay Brilliant all applicable Service fees using this online account.\nAll fees are exclusive of applicable taxes (e.g.\nsales, use, or value-added tax), unless otherwise stated, and User is solely

again after any subsequent subscription period, User's subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price User agreed to when subscribing.\nUser agrees that User's account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature.\nIf User does not wish User's account to renew automatically, or if User wants to change or terminate User's subscription, please log in and go to the Change / Cancel Membership page.\nIf User cancels a subscription, User may use such subscription until the end of then-current subscription term and the subscription will not be renewed thereafter.\nHowever, User will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.\n</p>\n<p> By subscribing, User authorizes Brilliant to charge User's credit card, debit card or other payment method at such time and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period, including any sales or similar taxes imposed on User's subscription payments.\nUpon the renewal of your subscription, if Brilliant does not receive payment, User agrees that Brilliant may either terminate or suspend User's subscription and continue to attempt to charge User's payment method provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, User's account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, User's new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).\nIf User does not terminate User's subscription and/or if User continues to use the Service, User agrees that Brilliant is authorized to charge the payment method in User's Service account.\nBrilliant may also seek payment directly from User.\nCharges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise specified when User initially subscribes to the Service.\n</p> C.\nPromotions <p> Any free trial or other promotion that provides subscriber-level access to the Service must be

copyright that has been allegedly infringed;</li>\n<li>Identification of works or materials being infringed;</li>\n<li>Identification of the content that is claimed to be infringing including

repeat offenders will have the infringing content removed from the system.\nand</li>\n<li>to terminate such content provider's, member's or user's access to the service.</li>\n</ol> C.\nProcedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent: <p> If the content provider, member or user believes that the content that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such content from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or
