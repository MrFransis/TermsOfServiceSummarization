such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged on a monthly or yearly basis (depending on the Premium plan previously purchased/subscribed) to your Payment Method on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of the paying portion of your membership.\nIn some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month.\nYou can change your Payment Method by visiting our website and clicking on the \u201cYour Account\u201d section.\nIf a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not change your Payment Method or cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have obtained a valid Payment Method.\nWhen you update your Payment Method, you authorize us to continue charging the updated Payment Method, and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.\nThis may result in a change to your payment billing dates.\nFor some Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you certain fees, such as a foreign transaction fee or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method.\nLocal tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used.\nCheck with your Payment Method service provider for details.</p>\n<p>\n<b>11.3</b> When you register for a Premium Subscription or Free Trial, you consent to get access to Ludwig Premium immediately.\nGiven that we already offer a free trial of fifteen (15) days of the Ludwig\u2019s Premium Service, Refunds will not, however, be provided once that the free trial period of fifteen (15) days expires.\nMoreover, it must be noted that the fifteen days free trial is not included if you are purchasing a Promo Offer or any discounted offer directly from Ludwig or a third party.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>11.4</b> Your payment to Ludwig\u2019 Premium Service will automatically renew at the end of the monthly or yearly subscription period, unless you cancel your Premium Subscription before the end of the current subscription period.\nYou can cancel your Ludwig membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Ludwig service through the end of your monthly billing period.\nTo the extent permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial-month membership periods.\nIf you cancel your membership, you will be automatically downgraded to the Free Service at the end of your current billing period.\nMore specifically, the cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period.\nHowever, if you cancel your payment or Paid Subscription and/or terminate any of the Agreements before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.\nTo cancel, go to your \u201cAccount\u201d and follow the instructions for cancellation.</p>\n<p>\n<b>11.5</b> If you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, your subscription is also subject to the terms of your agreement with that third party (in

adding new Fees, at any time on ten (10) days\u2019 notice.\nSuch notice may be sent to you by email to your most recently provided email address or posted on the Site or by any other manner chosen by Ludwig in its commercially reasonable discretion.\nYou will be deemed to have received any such notice that is posted on the Site on the day it was posted.\nYour use of the Services after the ten (10) day notice period constitutes your acceptance of the new or revised Fees.\nThe Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of your next monthly or yearly subscription period.\nAs permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Ludwig Service after the price change takes effect.\nIf you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Ludwig Service prior to the price change going into effect.\nPlease therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.</p>\n<p>\n<b>11.7</b> By subscribing to Ludwig\u2019s Premium Service you acknowledge that you lost your right to withdrawal, but this does not affect your right to cancel your membership at any time.\nThe right of withdrawal is a right that allows European consumers to withdraw from their contract within 14 days of its effective date.\nSince we at Ludwig already provide our customers with fifteen (15) days of free trial, we rely on an exception for digital content providers, and our service does not include a right of withdrawal.\nLudwig does not offer a right of withdrawal in any European country, however you can cancel at any time during the free trial of fifteen (15) days or after.\nAfter 15 days from your purchase, you may cancel your subscription as described above but you will not receive a refund.\nSpecifically, at the end of the trial we will automatically apply the yearly/monthly price, at the then-current yearly/monthly price, and start charge your payment details on a yearly/monthly recurring basis, unless you cancel or change your subscription before the trial period ends.\nThe law requires us to inform you that you do not have a right of withdrawal.\nTo this end, when our customers sign up in any European country they acknowledge that they lose their right of withdrawal.\nAcknowledging that you lose your right of withdrawal will not affect any of your other rights as a consumer and will not affect your ability to cancel your subscription at any time.</p>\n<p>\n<b>11.8 Invoices.\n</b>Please note that, according to Italian Fiscal law, if you need an invoice, you have to request it before you go through the payment process.\nTo request an invoice for your payments, send a request to invoice@ludwig.guru, adding invoice information (Business name,

activation of your premium subscription.\nWe will send you the invoice at the email address you have used to register.</p>\n<b>12 Term and termination</b>\n<p>\n<b>12.1</b> The Agreements will

AND LUDWIG AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\n</p>\n<p>Unless both you and Ludwig agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class

or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Ludwig as a user of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding individual arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of the Agreements.</p>\n<p>\n<b>20.6</b> Notwithstanding clause (20.5) above, you and Ludwig both agree that nothing herein will be

Agreements, and will be administered by the International Court of Arbitration of the ICC.\nAny arbitration will be conducted in the Italian language and unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of a member state of the European Union or any other jurisdiction, the law to be applied in any arbitration shall be the Italian law, without regard to choice or conflicts of law principles.</p>\n<p>\n<b>20.8</b> Any arbitration must be commenced by filing a demand for arbitration within ONE (1) YEAR after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or reasonably should know of the act, omission, or default giving rise to the claim.\nand there shall be no right to any remedy for any claim not asserted within that time period.\nIf applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<b>20.9</b> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by certified email (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nLudwig's address for Notice is: Ludwig Srls, Via Fiume 6, 90133, Palermo.\nLudwig\u2019s certified email is: ludwig@mypec.eu.\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d).\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Ludwig may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Ludwig shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIn the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Ludwig shall pay you (1) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (2) the last written settlement amount offered by Ludwig in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nor (3) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.\nAll documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of arbitrator\u2019s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.\nExcept as required to enforce the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award, neither you nor Ludwig shall make any public announcement or public comment or originate any publicity concerning the arbitration, including, but not limited to, the fact that the parties are in dispute, the existence of the arbitration, or any decision or award of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<b>20.10</b> In the event that Ludwig makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Ludwig's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Ludwig's address for Notice, in which case your account with Ludwig shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, shall survive.</p>\n<p>\n<b>20.11</b> If the class action waiver at article 20.3 is found to be unenforceable in arbitration or if any part of articles from 20.5 to 20.10 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then all the provisions of such articles (from 20.5 to 20.10) shall be considered null and void and, in such case, the parties
