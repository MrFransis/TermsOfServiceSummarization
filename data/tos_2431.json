money to another Cash App user, then you\u2019ll need to give us some more information about you, and we\u2019ll need to be able to verify your identity.</p>\n<p>You must be a resident of the United States, at least 18 years and the age of majority in your State of residence, and you must register for an account (your \u201cAccount) to use the Service.\nCertain features of the Service will only

certain information about you and we are able to verify your identity.</p>\nIII.\nCash App Account and Communication\n1.\nCash App Account\n<p> Here\u2019s the part where you tell us you own the email

help us do so.</p>\n<p>You represent and warrant that you own the email or mobile phone number you register with and all information entered or collected in the course of creating your Account and any

\u201cRestricted Account.\u201d A Restricted Account has all the features and functionality described in these Terms of Service except that you cannot make a payment to another Cash App customer (including a Cash for Business Seller) using your Cash App Balance (defined below).\nWith a Restricted Account you may link an external, U.S.-issued bank account (an \u201cEligible Bank Account\u201d) (subject to these Terms of Service) to make a payment to another Cash App customer (including payments made to a Cash for Business Seller), and you may transfer funds from your Cash App Balance to your Eligible Bank Account.\nIf you have a Restricted Account and you attempt to make a payment to another Cash App customer from your Cash App Balance, then you will be given the option of upgrading your Account to an \u201cUnrestricted Account\u201d.To upgrade your Account, you will need to provide us with certain personal information so that we can verify your identity.\nAfter we verify your identity, your Account will convert to an Unrestricted Account.\nIf you decline to provide us with the information that we request or if we cannot verify your identity to our satisfaction (in our sole judgment and discretion) for any reason, then your Account will remain a Restricted Account and you will not be able to use your Cash App Balance to make payments to other Cash App users.</p>\n<p>The first time you access your Account using a new device we may require you to authenticate your Account with additional information.\nIf your Account cannot be verified you may be required to set up a

Contact us if you see any errors or issues with your account.\nOur contact info is below, along with a description of the process and timeline for us to look into your issue.\nWe\u2019ll need some basic information from you to begin our investigation.\n</p>\n<p>In case of errors or questions about your account call us at 1-855-351-2274, please note (1) this is the only phone number customers can call for Cash App support, and (2) a Cash App representative will never ask you for your password, PIN, social security number or full debit card number.\nOr write us at Square, Inc., 1455 Market

access your Account, if the error could be viewed in your electronic history.\nIn order for us to assess the situation, you will need to tell us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your name and Account number;</li>\n<li>Why you believe there is an error, and the dollar amount involved.\nand</li>\n<li>Approximately when the error took place.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.\nWe will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly.\nIf we need more time however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question.\nIf we decide to do this, and your Account is registered with us, we will credit your Account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.\nIf we ask you to put your complaint or

account.\nDepending on the circumstances, if an unauthorized transaction has occurred we may be able to cover you.\n</p>\n<p>Please let us know if you believe there is an Unauthorized Transaction on your Account.\nYou could lose all the money in your Account.</p>\n<p>We will protect you from Unauthorized Transactions in your Account.\nWhen this protection applies, we will cover you for the full amount of the Unauthorized Transaction, so long as we were able to complete the Error Resolution procedures described above.</p>\n<p>An \"Unauthorized Transaction\" occurs when money is sent from your Account that you did not authorize and that did not benefit you.\nFor example, if someone steals your password, uses the password to access your Account, and sends a payment from your Account, an Unauthorized Transaction has occurred.\nHowever, the following are NOT considered Unauthorized Transactions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give someone access to your Account (e.g.\nby giving them your login information) and they use your Account without your knowledge or permission, unless you have notified us that transfers by that person are no longer authorized;</li>\n<li>If you, or someone else with whom you are acting in concert, act with fraudulent intent.\nor</li>\n<li>You reverse engineer or chargeback a transaction made with your Cash Card.</li>\n</ul>\n5.\nOur Liability\n<p> We will cover your losses for certain incomplete or incorrect transactions, detailed here.\n</p>\n<p>If we do not complete a transaction to or from your Account on time or in the correct amount according to these Cash Terms, we will be liable for your losses or damages.\nHowever, there are some exceptions.\nWe will not be liable, for instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If, through no fault of ours, you have insufficient funds in your Account to complete the transaction;</li>\n<li>If the ATM where you are making the Transaction or using your Cash Card does not have enough cash;</li>\n<li>If the Cash App was not working properly and you knew about the breakdown when you started the transaction;</li>\n<li>If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.</li>\n</ul>\n6.\nFunding Sources Used for Payments Made Through the Service\n<p>You may link an Eligible Bank Account to your Cash App to fund payments made through the Service.\nSquare reserves the right to limit which banks or what types of accounts constitute an Eligible Bank Account.\nIf you choose to link your Eligible Bank Account to your Cash App by providing the username and password you use to access your bank information online, you acknowledge your personal and financial information is being provided to Plaid Inc., that your personal and financial information will be collected, processed, transferred, or stored in accordance with Plaid Inc.\u2019s Privacy Policy, and that you acknowledge and agree to Plaid Inc\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>When you initiate a payment through the Cash App, if you have a Restricted Account, then you will not be able to initiate payments to other Cash App users (including Sellers with Cash for Business accounts) with your Cash App Balance.\nIf you have a Restricted Account and you wish to make a payment to another Cash App customer, you may: (1) use an Eligible Bank Account or Eligible Credit Account.\nor (2) upgrade to an Unrestricted Account to make the payment with your Cash App Balance.</p>\n<p>If you have an Unrestricted Account and have sufficient funds in your Cash App Balance to satisfy the full payment amount you can choose whether you want the payment fulfilled by your Cash App Balance, Eligible Bank Account or Eligible Credit Account.\nIf you do not have sufficient funds in your Cash App Balance to cover the full transaction, then you may choose the funding source from your Eligible Transaction Accounts or Eligible Credit Accounts.</p>\n7.\nCashtags\n<p> You may choose a unique username for Cash App, which will be your \u201cCashtag.\u201d If you choose a Cashtag that turns out to be too confusing or deceptive, we might require you to change it.\n</p>\n<p>You may select a unique alpha-numeric name to identify yourself on the Service (a \u201cCashtag\u201d).\nYour Cashtag must accurately and truthfully represent your business or personal identity.\nYou may not select a Cashtag that misleads or deceives others as to your identity or creates an undue risk of chargebacks or mistaken payments.\nWe may require you to change your Cashtag or details of your Account Information in our sole discretion, and we may reclaim or make unavailable Cashtags without liability to you.</p>\n8.\nSharing of Your Information\n<p>We will share Account Information and transaction information, including your name, the amount, and a description, with the other party to your transaction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>\n9.\nText Messages\n<p> Here\u2019s where we describe your consent to receive texts from us and your representations regarding texts we send to others relating to your payments.\n</p>\n<p>By providing us with a mobile number, you consent to receiving text (SMS) messages from us.\nIf you provide us with the mobile number of any other person or entity when initiating or requesting a payment through the Service, you represent and warrant to us that the person or entity has consented to receive text messages from us related to that payment.\nStandard text messaging rates may apply based on your plan with your mobile carrier.</p>\n10.\nCash App Fees\n<p>The fee for using the Cash App are found in the \"Stored Balance Disclosures\" in Section IV.1 of these Terms.\nWe reserve the right to charge for or change the fees associated with the use of the Cash App at any time subject to these Cash Terms.\nA fee may be imposed by Square or an ATM operator for use of the Cash Card at an ATM, including for a balance inquiry, and by any network used to complete the ATM transaction.</p>\n11.\nCash App Investing\n<p> If you want to use Cash App to buy stocks you need to sign up with our broker-dealer, Cash App Investing LLC.\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to use brokerage services provided by Cash App Investing LLC, a FINRA registered broker-dealer and subsidiary of Square (\u201cCash App Investing\u201d), you must open a brokerage account with Cash App Investing and agree to their terms and conditions for such account.\nBy using any Cash App Investing services, you authorize and instruct us to follow any instructions provided to us by Cash App Investing on your behalf regarding the transmission or receipt of any funds in your Cash App Balance.</p>\nIV.\nCash App Balance\n1.\nGeneral\n<p> By initiating transactions from your linked bank account or debit card, you are authorizing us to debit those sources.\nIf we incur costs because you have insufficient funds in your account, you will cover those costs.\n</p>\n<p>a.\n<strong>Functionality</strong>.\nYour balance consists of the funds you have in your Account that are available for new transactions and are not subject to pending transactions (your \u201cCash App Balance\u201d).\nYou are solely responsible for all funds necessary to complete any payments initiated through the Service.\nYou agree to reimburse Square for any fees, costs, or expenses it incurs as a result of insufficient or unavailable funds in connection with any payment you initiate through the Service.</p>\n<p>b.\n<strong>Authorization</strong>.\nBy instructing us through the Cash App to add funds from an Eligible Bank Account or Direct Deposit (both defined below) or debit card to your Cash App Balance or make any other transfer you authorize us to debit such Eligible Bank Account or debit card for the amount instructed, either in a single or recurring transaction, as applicable.</p>\n<p>c.\n<strong>Limitations</strong>.\nSquare may impose limits on the amount you can keep in your Cash App Balance and reserves the right to change these limits at any time.\nFunds in your Cash App Balance might not be available to use for all types of transactions.\nIf you have a Restricted Account, then you may not use your Cash App Balance to make payments to other Cash App users (including Cash for Business Sellers) unless you first upgrade to an Unrestricted Account.</p>\n2.\nFunding Your Cash App Balance\n<p> There are several ways you can add funds to your Cash App balance.\nEach method is described here.\n</p>\n<p>a.\n<strong>Eligible Bank Account</strong>.\nYou may use funds from your Eligible Bank Account to fund your Cash App Balance.</p>\n<p>b.\n<strong>Direct Deposit</strong>.\nYou may direct payments made to you from your employer or otherwise into your Cash App Balance using the bank routing and account number provided to you under the direct deposit program provided by our partner banks (the \u201cDirect Deposit\u201d).\nSuch Direct Deposits are governed by the terms and conditions provided by the applicable bank.</p>\n<p>c.\n<strong>Debit Card</strong>.\nYou may link a debit card to fund your Cash App Balance.\nTo do so, you must have a valid debit card issued by a U.S.\nbank or financial institution bearing the Visa Inc.\n(\u201cVisa\u201d), MasterCard International Inc.\n(\u201cMasterCard\u201d), or DFS Services, LLC (\u201cDiscover\u201d) logo.\nAny such debit card, collectively with your Cash App Balance (if you have an Unrestricted Account) and an Eligible Bank Account, is referred to herein as an \u201cEligible Transaction Account\u201d.</p>\n<p>d.\n<strong>P2P Payments Received Through Cash App</strong>.\nYou can keep funds received from P2P Payments (defined below) made to you through the Cash App in your Cash App Balance.</p>\n<p>e.<strong>Access to Funds</strong>.Certain funding features (such as cash loads and Direct Deposit) may be unavailable or delayed from time to time due to risk-based restrictions, scheduled maintenance, changes to our Services, unforeseen circumstances, or outages.</p>\n3.\nTransferring Funds to Your Bank Account\n<p> You can transfer funds from your Cash App balance out to your bank account.\nThese transfers can take up to three days, or for a fee, be made instantly.\nWe may limit your ability to transfer funds to your bank account, based on the circumstances.\nFor example, we may delay transfers while we screen for fraud or risks.\nYou are responsible for all amounts owed on your account even after it is closed.\n</p>\n<p>a.\n<strong>Transfers to Your Bank Account</strong>.\nYou may electronically transfer funds from your Cash App Balance to an Eligible Bank Account.\nBy selecting an Eligible Bank Account as your deposit source you are requesting that we settle an electronic transfer to your bank account.\nSquare will settle these electronic transfers (via the Automated Clearing House (\u201cACH\u201d) of NACHA - The Electronic Payment Association (\u201cNACHA\u201d)) to your Eligible Bank Account in the amount you instruct, and you will not be able to cancel the ACH transfer.\nSuch transfer to your Eligible Bank Account via ACH will typically arrive within three (3) business days.</p>\n<p>b.\n<strong>Instant Deposit</strong>.\nIf such feature is available to you, you may transfer funds from your Cash App Balance to your Eligible Bank Account instantly via the Cash App\u2019s instant deposit feature, which is subject to the fees detailed in the Instant Deposit experience.</p>\n<p>c.\n<strong>Limitations</strong>.\nSquare may limit how many transfers you can initiate from your Cash App to your Eligible Bank Account and the amount of funds you can transfer in a single transaction.\nWe reserve the right to delay or further limit such transfers while we screen for risk, or we may request you provide additional information to verify your identity.\nYou may not transfer funds from your Cash App Balance to your Eligible Bank Account to evade a payment investigation.\nIf you attempt to transfer your Cash App Balance while we are conducting an investigation, we may hold your funds at our discretion to protect Square or a third party against the risk of reversals, chargebacks, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability.\nWe also may defer or redirect payout or restrict access to your funds as necessary to comply with applicable law, subpoena or court order, or if requested by any governmental entity.\nYou will remain liable for all obligations related to your Account even after the Account is closed.</p>\n4.\nTreatment of Funds\n<p> Square will not mix your funds with Square\u2019s corporate funds.\nYour funds will be held in pooled bank accounts with the funds of other Cash App customers.\n</p>\n<p>If you do hold funds in your Cash App Balance, Square will hold such funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use your funds for any corporate purposes, nor will Square voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.\nSquare will combine your funds with the funds of other users and place those pooled accounts in one or more bank accounts in Square\u2019s name.</p>\n5.\nInterest\n<p> You will not receive interest on the funds that you have in your stored balance.\n</p>\n<p>You agree that you will not receive interest on or other monies derived from the funds that Square handles and places in pooled accounts.\nIt is likely that Square will receive interest on funds held for its users.\nIn consideration for your use of the Service, and with full knowledge and understanding that Square will receive this interest, you irrevocably transfer and assign to Square all right that you may have in any interest that may accrue on funds held in pooled accounts.</p>\nV.\nPeer to Peer Service\n1.\nDescription Of Service\n<p>The peer-to-peer Service (\u201cPeer-to-Peer Service\u201d) allows you to send funds or receive funds for peer-to-peer personal, non-commercial purposes.</p>\n2.\nSending Funds\n<p> You will be able to send funds using our P2P service if you have a linked bank account or linked a credit card.\nIf you have an Unrestricted Account you will also be able to send funds using our P2P service if you have funds available in your balance.\nYou authorize us to move funds on your behalf.\nWe won\u2019t be responsible for certain incomplete transactions, as described here.</p>\n<p>Once you have opened an Account and either have funds available in an Eligible Transaction Account or linked a credit card issued by a U.S.-based bank or financial institution bearing the trademark of Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or American Express Travel Related Payment Services Company, Inc.\n(\u201cAmerican Express\u201d) (an \u201cEligible Credit Account), you will be able to send funds using the Peer-to-Peer Service.\nNote that your Cash App Balance will not be an \u201cEligible Transaction Account\u201d until you have given us certain information and we have verified your identity, as set forth above.\nThis means that until (a) you give us this information (b) we verify your identity and (c) you have an Unrestricted Account, you will not be able to use the Cash App Balance to send funds using the Peer-to-Peer Service.\nYour Cash App Balance is an \u201cEligible Transaction Account\u201d only if you have an Unrestricted Account.\nWith a Restricted Account, you may send funds with the Peer-to-Peer Service using an Eligible Credit Account or an Eligible Bank Account.</p>\n<p>As a party initiating a transfer (\u201cSender\u201d), you will send funds to your selected recipient (\u201cRecipient\u201d) by designating the Recipient and the transfer amount to us (a \u201cPayment Instruction\u201d).\nYour Payment Instruction authorizes us to move funds from your Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account to your designated Recipient (a \u201cP2P Payment\u201d).\nBy submitting a Payment Instruction, you are also authorizing us to move funds to your applicable Eligible Transaction or applicable Eligible Credit Account for P2P Payments that are canceled or otherwise returned.</p>\n<p>You understand and agree that when you initiate a P2P Payment Instruction using the Service, the processing of the Payment Instruction will begin, and funds will leave your Eligible Transaction Account, as early as the moment of the initiation of such Payment Instruction.\nHowever, we will only begin to process the requested transfer of funds to the Recipient once the Recipient has provided all required information, and you hereby authorize and direct us to retain such funds until the earlier of such time as the Recipient has provided all required information or fourteen (14) days.</p>\n<p>You agree that we shall incur no liability if we are unable to complete any transaction because of: (i) insufficient funds in your Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account.\n(ii) malfunction of the Peer-to-Peer Service due to circumstances beyond our control or due to circumstances that you were already aware of at the time you initiated your Payment Instruction.\n(iii) inaccurate or insufficient Payment Instructions.\nor (iv) failure of the Recipient to claim the P2P Payment.\nor (v) either you or the Recipient does not provide us with any information that we request, or we are unable to verify your identity or the identity of the Recipient to our satisfaction.</p>\n3.\nRequesting Funds\n<p>You may also request funds to be transferred to you through the Peer-to-Peer Service by designating the amount of funds requested and your selected Sender (a \u201cCash Request\u201d).\nIf the Sender approves your Cash Request, your Cash Request will become the Sender\u2019s Payment Instructions and be processed as described in these Cash Terms.</p>\n4.\nReceiving Funds\n<p>Any P2P Payment you receive via the Peer-to-Peer Service will be stored in your Cash App Balance.</p>\n5.\nPeer-to-Peer Service Payment Amount Limits\n<p> If you\u2019re sending large amounts of money over the thresholds described here, you will need to provide additional ID so that we can make sure you are who you say you are.\n</p>\n<p>Additional identification information will be required to send more than two hundred and fifty dollars ($250) in any one transaction or in multiple transactions over any seven (7) day period or to receive more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) in any thirty (30) day period.\nSenders may not send more than seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) in any one transaction or in multiple transactions over any seven (7) day period, subject to some restrictions.\nWe may adjust these limits at any time in our discretion.\nCurrent limits are posted on our Support Center.</p>\n6.\nPeer-to-Peer Service Fees\n<p> Sending money to others through our P2P service is currently free, but we can charge fees in the future.\n</p>\n<p>There are currently no fees for sending funds via an Eligible Transaction Account using the Peer-to-Peer Service.\nThe fee for sending funds using an Eligible Credit Account through Peer-to-Peer Service will be displayed at the time of the transaction.\nWe reserve the right to charge for or change the fees associated with use of the Peer-to-Peer Service at any time subject to these Cash Terms.</p>\n7.\nPayment Cancellation, Stop Payment Requests and Refused Payments\n<p>Our ability to stop a P2P Payment Instruction or recover funds associated with an unauthorized Payment Instruction will depend on how the Payment Instruction was initiated, and whether the Payment Instruction has begun processing.\nP2P Payments not claimed by a Recipient for fifteen (15) days after the processing has begun will be canceled automatically.\nWe will attempt to return any unclaimed, refused, refunded, prohibited, or denied P2P Payment to your Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account, as applicable.\nIf we are not able to do so, we may use other reasonable means to return the P2P Payment to you, as permitted by applicable law.</p>\n8.\nInvalid P2P Payments\n<p> If we believe you received a payment that should not have been made for some reason (for example, fraud), you give us permission to reverse that payment.\nWe are not responsible for any payments that you receive, even if you don\u2019t know who sent the payment.\n</p>\n<p>If you receive a P2P Payment and we later determine in our sole discretion that the P2P Payment was invalid for any reason, you hereby authorize us to move funds from the applicable Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account in an amount equal to the P2P Payment.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable in any way for any P2P Payments that you may receive, regardless of whether you authorized the Sender to send them to you.</p>\n9.\nRisk of Fraudulent Transactions\n<p>The Peer-to-Peer Service is a money transmission service.\nAs a result, fraudulent transactions may result in the loss of funds with no recourse.</p>\nVI.\nCash Card\n1.\nIssuance of the Cash Card\n<p> We may arrange for a bank to provide you with a virtual or physical Cash Card.\nBy using the Cash Card, you agree to any additional applicable terms from the issuing bank.\nWe may cancel, repossess or revoke your Cash Card at any time.\n</p>\n<p>Square may arrange for an issuing bank to provide you with access to a prepaid payment card under the Cash App Prepaid Card Program or a debit card under the demand deposit account program (each a \u201cCash Card\u201d).\nBy using the Cash Card, you agree to the Cash App Prepaid Card Program Agreement or the Cash Lincoln Savings Bank Terms, as applicable (each the \u201cCash Card Terms\u201d), which may be updated from time to time.\nFor avoidance of doubt, the applicable Cash Card Terms are between you and the issuing bank of your card program, not Square, and in the event of any inconsistency between these Cash Terms and the applicable Cash Card Terms, the applicable Cash Card Terms shall govern your use of the Cash Card and your relationship with the issuing bank.</p>\n<p>The Cash Card may be issued in virtual or physical form.\nTo activate the virtual card, and to request a physical card, you need to follow in-app prompts.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to reject signatures and card applications for any reason.\nProhibited signatures include, but are not limited to, those signatures that depict inappropriate subject matter, the intellectual

Payment Terms.\nWe may use certain information from your Account Information to create your Square Account and display such information to your customers, such as on receipts.\nIn connection with the Payment Services (as defined in the Payment Terms), you authorize us to act as your agent for the purposes of holding, receiving, and disbursing funds on your behalf.\nOnce you have created an Account

political campaigns who use Cash for Business.\nNote that you can fund these purchases from your Cash App Balance only if we have verified your identity as described above.\nIf we have not yet

use Cash for Business.\nYou may only use other authorized linked accounts for such transactions.</p>\n<p>Typically Cash for Business Sellers will be identified to you by a badge in the Cash App.\nBy initiating a payment transaction to a Cash for Business Seller, you authorize the Cash for Business Seller to charge your applicable Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account to complete the purchase or donation and you consent to sharing information from your Account with the Cash for Business Seller.\nIn the event you are entitled to a reversal, refund, chargeback, or other adjustment associated with any purchase you made through Cash for Business, you also authorize a credit to the applicable Eligible Transaction Account or Eligible Credit Account to accomplish that

our terms for Mobile Check Capture.\nBy using the service you agree to these terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>These Mobile Check Capture Terms of Service (the \u201cMobile Check Capture Terms\u201d) govern

we do, we will notify you of our decision, and you may cash or deposit the check through another service or at a different institution.\nAfter two weeks, you must either destroy the original check or clearly and indelibly mark it as VOID, unless we have contacted you with other instructions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You will not use Mobile Check Capture to (i) interfere with or disrupt the operation

by us when you create the Electronic Check, and had not been indorsed by you or anyone else before.\nand</li>\n<li>The check has not been dishonored previously, nor are you aware of any reason to believe that the check will be dishonored (e.g., you have been told that the maker of the check does not have enough money in the account to cover the check).</li>\n</ol>\nIII.\nRepresentations and Warranties\n<p> Here is the part where you tell us all the information on the check you are transmitting through Mobile Check Capture is true and that the check is eligible for this service.\n</p>\n<p>Each time that you submit an Electronic Check with Mobile Check Capture, you represent and warrant to us that all of the following are true:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The check that you are

Capture.\nBefore using the Mobile Check Capture, confirm that all your contact information in the Cash App is up to date.\nBe sure to check your email and text messages for the email address and phone number we will use to contact you.</li>\n</ol>\nV.\nDishonored Electronic Checks\n<p>If any Electronic Check is dishonored or returned unpaid for any reason, then we may immediately (and without further notice to you) deduct any funds from the Electronic Check that we have credited to your Cash App Balance.\nIf we have already made funds from the Electronic Check available to you then this deduction may result in a negative Cash App Balance.\nWe may recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Virtual Currency Terms of Service \"Recovery of Funds\" to bring your negative balance to zero.</p>\nVI.\nClaims by Drawee Bank\n<p> The bank that accepts your check from us may have a claim against us if there are problems with your check.\nSome common problems, but not all, are listed here.\nIf we make the bank that accepts your check whole, then we may recover funds from you.\n</p>\nPursuant to applicable law and the rules of the check collection system, the drawee bank or a collecting bank might pursue a warranty claim or other claim against us related to the Electronic Check, even after the check was honored and paid in full.\nCommon grounds for claims like this include:\n<ol>\n<li>The original check, or another electronic check created from the original check, was presented for payment, either before or after the drawee bank paid the Electronic Check;</li>\n<li>The maker\u2019s signature or any indorsement was forged, or the check was otherwise issued fraudulent and without the authorization of a person authorized to write checks on the account;</li>\n<li>The check was altered after it was made.\nand</li>\n<li>The information in the Electronic Check images did not match the information that you provided at the time that you submitted the Electronic Check, or it was not possible to verify that information because the information in the Electronic Check images was illegible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are just a few examples of the reasons that the drawee bank or a collecting bank may assert a claim with respect to the Electronic Check to recover amounts paid.\nIf we (or one of our banks or other service providers) are subject to such a claim, then we may immediately recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds (and without notice to you).</p>\nVII.\nFunds Availability\n1.\nYour Ability to Withdraw or Use Funds from an Electronic Check\n<p> We may delay your access to funds while we process your check.\n</p>\nOur policy is to delay the availability of funds from Electronic Checks that you Successfully Submit (as defined below) with Mobile Check Capture.\nDuring the delay, you may not use the funds for transactions, including transactions to: (i) make a payment to another Cash App customer (including a Cash for Business Seller).\n(ii) withdraw cash using your Cash Card.\n(iii) make a purchase with your Cash Card.\n(iv) fund a transfer to your Eligible Bank Account.\n(v) initiate a \u201cBuy\u201d transaction for virtual currency.\nor (vi) fund an order to purchase securities using your Cash App Investing Account.\n<p>An Electronic Check is considered \u201cSuccessfully Submitted\u201d when you have received confirmation within the Cash App that the Electronic Check has been submitted and accepted by us.</p>\n2.\nWhen Funds From an Electronic Check Generally Will be Available\n<p> This is where we tell you the cut off time for a check to be submitted in order to be counted on a specific day and potential hold periods.</p>\nThe length of the delay is counted in business days from the day that you Successfully Submit the Electronic Check.\nEvery day is a business day except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays.\nIf you Successfully Submit an Electronic Check before 7:00 p.m.\nEastern Time on a business day, we will consider the Electronic Check to have been Successfully Submitted on that day.\nHowever, if you Successfully Submit an Electronic Check after 7:00 pm Eastern Time or on a day that is not a business day, we will consider that the Electronic Check was Successfully Submitted on the next business day.\nFunds from a U.S.\nTreasury check will generally be available the first business day after you Successfully Submit the Electronic Check with Mobile Check Capture, unless such deposit is subject to a hold as otherwise provided in this agreement.\n<p>Checks other than U.S.\nTreasury checks are subject to a hold period between 1 and 15 business days.</p>\n3.\nChecks Returned or Subject to a Refund Claim\n<p> We may make funds available to you before they clear from the paying bank.\nIf we do, and the funds do not clear the paying bank you will be required to pay back the funds we made available to you.\nIf you present us with a check that has been paid out by another bank and we also make funds available to you, you will be required to repay the funds to us.</p>\nIn many cases, funds from an Electronic Check will be made available to you sooner than the Electronic Check can be collected from the paying bank.\nThis means that an Electronic Check that you Successfully Submit with Mobile Check Capture could be returned unpaid after funds have been made available to you.\nIf an Electronic Check is returned unpaid, we may immediately reverse the amount credited to your Cash App Balance for the Electronic Check.\nIf this results in a negative balance, then you will be required to repay us this negative balance immediately.\nWe may recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds to bring your negative balance to zero.\n<p>If an Electronic Check is presented for payment more than once, the paying bank may recover funds paid on the Electronic Check.\nIf this happens, we may deduct the amount of the Electronic Check from your Cash App Balance immediately.\nIf this results in a negative balance, you will be required to repay the negative balance immediately, and we may recover funds from you in accordance with the Additional Cash App Terms of Service - Recovery of Funds to bring your negative balance to zero.</p>\nVIII.\nThird Party Rights\n<p> The image capture service on Cash App is provided by Mitek Systems, Inc (\u201cMitek\u201d).\nBelow are Mitek\u2019s rights to the intellectual property and
