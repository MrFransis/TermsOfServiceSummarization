RESOLUTION\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Summary: </em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Unless you live in a jurisdiction that does not allow it, any legal claim related to the Services or these Terms will be settled by binding arbitration, not a trial, and will be administered on an individual basis.\nYou can opt out of arbitration by writing us within thirty days of when you accept these Terms.\nThis Section does not prevent actions in small claims court and certain claims for immediate relief.</em>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION 10 (for purposes of this Section only, the \u201c<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>\u201d) CAREFULLY.\nIT IS PART OF YOUR CONTRACT WITH DASHLANE AND LIMITS THE WAYS YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>\n<p>a.\n<em>Arbitration</em>.\nSubject to Section 10(f<em>), </em>any dispute arising out of these Terms, the\nPrivacy Policy, or the Services will be resolved exclusively on an individual basis by binding and confidential arbitration conducted in the English language, in New York, New York, before a single commercial arbitrator from JAMS, Inc.\n(\u201c<strong>JAMS</strong>\u201d) applying the then-current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available\nhere or, if the amount of damages claimed or sought exceeds $250,000, the most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available\nhere.\nTo start the dispute resolution process, you must send a letter via overnight courier or registered mail to Dashlane, Inc., 44 West 18<sup>th</sup> St., Forth Fl.\nNew York, NY 10011, attn: Legal, requesting arbitration and describing your claim.\nArbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.\nYou and Dashlane will attempt to resolve any dispute informally prior to initiating arbitration.\nIf the issue has not been resolved within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice, either party may commence the arbitration process.\n</p>\n<p>b.\n<em>Authority of Arbitrator</em>.\nThe arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to these Terms, including their formation and any claim that some or all of it is void or unenforceable.\nThe arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Dashlane.\nThe arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties.\nThe arbitrator may (i) grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute, (ii) award monetary damages and grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual party under applicable law, the arbitral forum\u2019s rules, and these Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement).\nThe arbitrator will issue a written award and statement describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator will follow the applicable law.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon the parties.\nEach party will bear its own costs of arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>c.\n<em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>.\nYOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT (OTHER THAN AS NOTED IN SECTION 10(F) AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.\nYour rights will be determined by a neutral arbiter and not a judge or jury.\nArbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than rules applicable in court.\nArbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order, and subject to very limited judicial review.\n</p>\n<p>d.\n<em>Waiver of Class Action</em>.\nANY CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT (i) CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS, (ii) OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, OR (iii) AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF.\nIf a court determines that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this Section 10(d)\u2019s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the applicable claim, and only that claim, must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the state or federal courts located in New York, New York in accordance with Section 1(h).\nAll other claims will be arbitrated.\n</p>\n<p>e.\n<em>Opt Out</em>.\nYou may opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement requiring and governing arbitration by sending written notice to legal@dashlane.com or via mail to Dashlane, Inc., 44 West 18<sup>th</sup> Street, 4<sup>th</sup> Fl., New York, NY 10011, within thirty (30) days after accepting these Terms.\nYour notice must include your name and address, your Account Email, and an unequivocal statement that you are opting out of this Arbitration Agreement.\nOpting out will not affect any other provisions of these Terms.\n</p>\n<p>f.\n<em>Exceptions</em>.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, (i) either party may bring an individual action in small claims court, and (ii) claims of (A) defamation, (B) violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or (C) infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s intellectual property rights may be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York.\nThe parties consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts for such purposes.\nA request for equitable relief will not waive the right to arbitrate.</p>\n<p>g.\n<em>Fees</em>.\nIf you initiate an arbitration in which you seek less than $500 in damages and comply with the Arbitration Agreement, including the notice requirement, Dashlane will reimburse you for your JAMS filing fee, and will pay all administration and arbitrator fees up to a total amount of $500.\nIf the arbitrator grants you an award, Dashlane will reimburse your reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\n</p>\n<p>h.\n<em>Severability</em>.\nExcept as provided in Section 10(d), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts will be of no force and effect, but the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will continue in full force and effect.\n</p>\n11.\nMISCELLANEOUS\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Summary: </em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Much of this

citizens or residents of particular regions (e.g., the EU or California).\nWe may change this Policy at any time by posting the revised Policy here.\nWe will notify current users of the changes through email, in-app notifications, or otherwise.\nYou never have to provide Personal Data, but we need certain Personal Data (like your email for account creation) in order to provide the Services.\nWe try to collect only what we need.\nThe Services are not directed at children, and we will remove any information we have about children who are not invited users under a Family Plan when requested.\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\na.\n<em>General</em>.\nThis Privacy Policy (the \u201c<strong>Policy</strong>\u201d) describes how Dashlane, Inc.\nand its affiliates (\u201c<strong>Dashlane</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>we</strong>\u201d) collects, uses and shares information about visitors to our website at\nwww.dashlane.com (together with its subdomains, such as the Dashlane blog, the \u201c<strong>Site</strong>\u201d) and users of our mobile, desktop and web applications (each an \u201c<strong>App</strong>\u201d and, collectively, the \u201c<strong>Apps</strong>\u201d), which are available from the Site and third party sellers like the Google Play and Apple App Stores (any such seller, an \u201c<strong>App Store</strong>\u201d).\nThe Apps and the Site together are the \u201c<strong>Services</strong>.\u201d \u201c<strong>You</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>user</strong>\u201d refers to any user of the Services, including, as applicable, visitors to the Site.\nCapitalized words used but not defined in this Policy have the meanings provided in ou Terms of Service\n(the \u201c<strong>Terms</strong>\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>\nb.\n<em>Region Specific Provisions</em>.\nCertain provisions of the Policy apply only to residents of, or people subject to the laws of, jurisdictions with specific statutes governing individuals\u2019 rights over their Personal Data (as defined below), such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201c<strong>CCPA</strong>\u201d), the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Legislation (\u201c<strong>GDPR</strong>\u201d) and Brazil\u2019s LGPD.\nThese provisions are clearly labeled.\nOtherwise, the Policy applies to all users of our Services.\n</p>\n<p>\nc.\n<em>Changes</em>.\nWe may change this Policy at any time.\nWhen we do so, we will post the updated Policy on this page and, if the changes are material, inform existing users through email or the Services.\n</p>\n<p>\nd.\n<em> Children</em>.\nThe Services are not directed to children.\nHowever, children who are invited to use the Services by a parent or guardian (under a family plan or equivalent) may do so.\nIf you become aware that a child (based on the jurisdiction where the child lives, which in the United States means someone under the age of 13) has provided us with Personal Data without parental consent, contact our\nhelp center.\nWe will promptly remove the information from our systems.\n</p>\n<p>\ne.\n<em>Personal and Anonymous Data</em>.\nAs used in this Policy, \u201c<strong>Personal Data</strong>\u201d means information which, either alone or when combined with other information we hold, identifies an individual, such as name, mailing address, email address, IP address, and telephone number.\nBy contrast, \u201c<strong>Anonymous Data</strong>\u201d means data that, alone or combined with other information available to us or a third party with whom the data is shared, does not permit identification of an individual.\nWe collect and use both Personal Data and Anonymous Data as described below.\n</p>\n<p>\nf.\n<em>Why Do We Need Your Personal Data</em>? We need certain Personal Data to provide the Services.\nYou will be asked to provide this information \u2014 and must agree to this Policy and the Terms \u2014to download and use the Apps.\nThis consent, which you may withdraw at any time, provides the legal basis we need to process your Personal Data.\nYou are not required to provide the Personal Data that we request, but we may not be able to provide you with the Services or respond to your inquiries if you don\u2019t.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\n</strong>\n<strong>\nPARTICULARLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION (CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS)\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\n<em>(EU, UK, AND BRAZILIAN USERS).</em>\n</p>\n<p>\ni.\n<strong>Who We Are</strong>.\nFor the purpose of the GDPR, LGPD, and other legislation that requires the identification of a data controller of your Personal Data, the controller is Dashlane SAS of 21 Rue Pierre Picard, 75018 Paris, France.\nYou may contact our data protection officer at dpo@dashlane.com.\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nii.\n<strong>Must Read Sections</strong>\n<em>: </em>Please carefully review the sections entitled \u201cData Security and International Transfer\u201d and \u201cYour Rights Regarding Personal Data.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>b.\n<em>(CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA USERS).</em>\n</p>\n<p>\ni.\n<strong>Sale of Personal Data.\n</strong>You may opt out of all sales of your Personal Data on the Do Not Sell my Personal Information page.\n<strong>\nWe never exchange Personal Data for money or any other consideration (e.g., trade it for free services)\n</strong>\n.\nHowever, the CCPA\u2019s definition of \u201csale\u201d is very broad, and may include situations like when browsing data is sent to referral advertisers (when you click on an ad that sends you to Dashlane, we send a hashed identifier to the referring site so they can receive credit for the referral).\nWhile we only send what is needed to properly record the referral, the fact that you clicked on the link and visited Dashlane may be added to your profile by the ad publisher.\nThis is all done on the Site with \u201cPublisher Cookies\u201d (as defined in our\nCookie Policy), and opting out of the sale of your Personal Data will automatically turn them off.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\n</strong>\n<strong>HOW DOES DASHLANE OBTAIN DATA?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Summary:</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\nWe get data that you provide (such as when you create an Account or pay for a Subscription), that others provide (when you are invited to use Dashlane by your employer), that we obtain automatically from the Apps or through cookies, and from third parties.\nPersonal Data we collect includes your email (used to create an Account) and (for Subscriptions) certain billing information, although complete payment information is only stored by our payment processors.\n<strong>\nWe do not and cannot know your Master Password and, because of that, we do not and cannot know what Secured Data you store on the Services\n</strong>\n.\nWe use technology, including cookies, to collect usage data that we use to provide and improve the Services.\nAdditional information is available in our\n</em>\n<em>Cookie Policy</em>\n<em>.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe collect information in the following ways:\n</p>\n<p>a.\n<em>Information You Provide.</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Registration Data</u>\n.\nYou must create an Account to use an App, and to do so you must provide an email address that will be used as your login to the Services.\n<em>\nThe only Personal Data required to open a Dashlane Free account is your email\n</em>\n.\nWe store registration data until you delete your Account and for up to seven (7) days afterwards.\nFor paid Accounts, we collect the billing data specified below.\nFor Dashlane Business Plan Accounts, registration data includes the business name and mailing address, administrator contact information, and may include the business email addresses of Plan users.\n<strong>It is critical to keep your registration data current</strong>.\n<strong>\n</strong>Because the Services are designed to keep your most important information secure, we must be able to verify that you are the Account owner to respond to certain customer service requests.\nIf you lose access to the validated email address associated with your Account or a phone number used to validate your identity (if applicable), you may be locked out of your Account, and we may be unable to help you.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Billing Data</u>\n.\nWe use third party service providers (currently Stripe, Checkout.com, ProcessOut, and PayPal) to process payments made through the Site.\nWe store the expiration date and last four digits of your credit card for tax compliance and user support purposes.\nDepending on the provider, we may be able to access the name, address and phone number associated with a payment method on the payment processor\u2019s service, but complete credit card information is only stored by the processor.\nWe do not receive or store any billing data if you pay for a Subscription through an App Store.\nBilling data is retained until you delete your Account and for up to seven (7) days afterwards.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Master Password</u>\n.\nTo create an Account, you must create a \u201c<strong>Master Password</strong>,\u201d which is used to generate the encryption keys that secure the information you store in the Apps (\u201c<strong>Secured Data</strong>\u201d as further defined below).\nUltimately, the more secure your password is, the safer your Secured Data will be.\nThis is because,\n<strong>\neven if a hacker somehow obtained all the Secured Data on our servers, they would have to hack each Account separately\n</strong>\n(because Secured Data is always encrypted when we have it, and the encryption is based on the Account\u2019s Master Password).\nEach user must create their own Master Password, unless they access the Services through a Business Plan with the single sign on (SSO) feature enabled, in which case the encryption key is generated when the user is validated by the client\u2019s SSO provider.\nDashlane\u2019s Zero Knowledge technology ensures that we do not and cannot know our users\u2019 Master Passwords or the data used to generate the SSO encryption key, so we cannot access Secured Data.\nIn addition, Apps do not store Master Passwords locally unless specifically directed by the user.\nNote that if you direct an App to retain your Master Password and your device is stolen or compromised, your Secured Data may be exposed.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Secured Data</u>\n.\nOur Apps let you manage digital identity data, including highly sensitive information like credit card numbers and site or application credentials.\nThis, and everything else you store on the Apps, is Secured Data, and is encrypted and stored locally on your device(s) and on Dashlane\u2019s servers using a random key generated from your Master Password.\nSecured Data is encrypted at all times on Dashlane servers and cannot be accessed by Dashlane because the encryption key is generated from the Master Password.\nSee our Security Whitepaper for detailed information about how Dashlane protects your Secured Data.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Support and Correspondence</u>\n.\nYou may provide Personal Data in connection with user support requests and inquiries from our Site.\nUser support histories are maintained until the associated Account is deleted and for up to seven (7) days afterwards.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Feedback</u>\n.\nIf you provide us with Feedback, including reviews posted on App Stores or sites like Trustpilot, or suggestions made via Productboard and other direct research or outreach, we may use Personal Data provided in connection with the Feedback in order to respond to you.\nWe may use Feedback without limitation as described in the Terms.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Other Data</u>\n.\nWe may also collect other types of information in the manner disclosed by us when the information is collected.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nb.\n<em>Data You Provide About Others.\n</em>The Services let you invite others to try the Apps.\nIf you do this (or are invited this way), Dashlane will store the invitee\u2019s email address and the message sent to them in order to follow up (and, if applicable, credit the referrer with any referral bonus or equivalent).\nWe will let the invitee know who referred them to Dashlane, and let them request that their information be deleted from our systems.\nThe referrer or invitee may contact the\nhelp center to request removal of this information.\n</p>\n<p>c.\n<em>Data Collected by Technology.</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Device and Browser Data</u>\n.\nWe automatically log the following information about your computer or mobile device when you access the Services: operating system name and version, device identifier, browser type, browser language, and IP address.\nSome of this data is collected using cookies, as explained in the Cookie Policy .\nThis data is used to secure your Account, ensure the Services are presented in the correct language and optimized for your device, facilitate customer support, and for tax and compliance purposes (e.g., using the region associated with your IP address to display local regulatory notices).\nThis data is kept in our system until you delete your Account and for up to seven (7) days afterwards.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Usage Data</u>\n.\nLike many services, we use logs to collect data about the use of the Services (for example, use of features and interactions with the Apps and the

users\u2019 Personal Data.\nTo provide the Services, we share Personal Data with service providers who are contractually obliged to comply with all applicable laws (e.g., GDPR) and who only have access to the data they need to provide the relevant Services.\nIf you direct us to share Secured Data (which may include Personal Data) through the Services, we will do so.\nWe share hashed, encrypted user emails and device ids with advertisers to refine advertising efforts (e.g., so an active user does not see Dashlane ads on third-party sites and platforms).\nWe may share Personal Data with our affiliates, all of whom are bound by this Policy, and with an acquirer if Dashlane is sold or merged.\n<strong>We have no way to access Secured Data</strong>.\nDashlane Business Plan

\u201cemergency contact\u201d features).\nWhile this data is transferred through our servers, we do not have access to it, as noted elsewhere in this Policy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Service Providers</u>\n.\nWe provide Personal Data to service providers solely as required to provide the Services, including to create Accounts, provide technical support, process payments, or enable communication between you and Dashlane (for example, Personal Data needed to respond to and resolve customer support issues is available to our agents on Zendesk).\nWe review the security and data privacy practices of these service providers to ensure that they comply with applicable laws and this Policy.\nSecured Data stored by our data hosting provider (AWS) is always encrypted as described above.\nThe Subprocessors List discloses what service providers have access to Personal Data in connection with our delivery of the Services.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Marketing</u>\n.\nWe provide hashed

owned by, or under common control with, Dashlane, Inc.\n(\u201c<strong>Affiliates</strong>\u201d).\nWe share Personal Data among Affiliates as required to provide the Services and respond to

below.\nOur US Affiliates are also Privacy Shield certified .\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Dashlane Business Plan Administrators</u>\n.\nAdministrators of Dashlane Business Plan Accounts can see the email

receivership.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Other Disclosures</u>\n.\nWe will inform you of any other disclosures or your Personal Data, and obtain your consent, prior to such disclosure.\nHowever, regardless of
