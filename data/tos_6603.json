Payments 1.\nWhen signing up for the Services, an Applicant may select any Digital Subscription Package from those listed in Exhibit \u201cLineup of Digital Subscription Packages.\u201d 2.\nThe subscription rates for the subscription plans offered by the Service are set for each subscription plan.\nThe subscription fee is indicated at the time of application, and by completing the

the same day of the following month, with the same day of each month being the billing reference date for the current month.\nThe billing reference date for the current month is the same day of each

However, if the same day does not exist in the month following the application date, the month is counted as the last day of the following month.\nExample: When the signup date is May 31, the month shall be counted from May 31 to June 30 (since there is no June 31).\n4.\nThe billing date for annual payment is based on the date of application, and the billing reference date for the current year is the same day each year until the same day the following year.\n(All times are Japan Standard Time.) However, the billing date may be changed if the date does not exist in the year following the application date.\n5.\nIf you apply for a different subscription plan during the subscription period, the digital subscription fee for the current month will be charged at the time the digital subscription contract is formed.\n6.\nUnless you cancel or change your plan during the subscription period, your digital subscription will be automatically renewed with the same subscription plan as of the billing reference date.\n7.\nThroughout the period of a Digital Subscription Agreement, the applicable

the credit card company.\n3.\nIf the initial payment following sign-up is made in a currency other than the official currency of the country or territory where the credit card in use has been issued and such sign-up is subsequently cancelled, foreign exchange gains or losses may arise, depending on the difference between the exchange rate at the time of signing up and the exchange rate at the time of cancellation.\nIn addition, some credit card companies may charge commissions on transactions denominated in foreign currencies, regardless of whether they are processed or subsequently cancelled.\nCancellation of transactions by credit card is subject to the rules prescribed by respective credit card companies, the details of which should be confirmed by each Digital Subscriber directly with the relevant credit card company.\nSection 6.\nOutsourcing of Credit Card Processing Operations 1.\nThe Company outsources credit card processing operations for the Services to Stripe

card number, expiry date, and internal identification code which in itself cannot identify the specific individual.\n2.\nEach Applicant acknowledges and agrees that Stripe will process payments of Digital Subscription Fees for and on behalf of the Company and that the Company will disclose and provide the information necessary for such processing to Stripe.\n3.\nAfter the necessary information

detriment that may be incurred by the Digital Subscriber because of failure to update the Registered Information.\nSection 9.\nPersonal Information 1.\nThe Company shall stringently control and

by the Company and pursuant to the TOM, in which event such Personal Information shall be handled with adherence to the Privacy Policy.\n3.\nEven after unsubscribing, expiration of the Digital

operations, in which event such Personal Information shall be handled with adherence to the Privacy Policy.\n4.\nPersonal Information may be utilized by the Company solely within the scope of utilization described as follows.\nIn addition, if the Company has obtained prior consent of the person relevant to the Personal Information, the Company may utilize the Personal Information to the

the next billing reference date.\n3.\nDigital subscriptions for each plan will be charged in full and no prorated fee will be refunded, even if you cancel the subscription in the middle of the subscription period.\n4.\nIf a Digital Subscriber is unable to cancel the Digital Subscription Agreement because of loss of Personal Authentication Information or for any other reason attributable to the Digital Subscriber, the Company shall not be obligated to carry out the cancellation process for this Digital Subscriber.\n5.\nDigital subscribers can continue to use the news site as a free member even if they cancel or terminate their digital subscription contract.\n6.\nThe status as a Digital Subscriber is valid solely for the Digital Subscriber him/herself.\nWhen the Company becomes

became aware of the fact.\n7.\nIn no event shall the Company be liable for any damage that may be incurred by any Digital Subscriber due to any actions taken by the Company under Section 10.\nSection

Subscription Agreement with each subscription plan, the Company\u2019s credit card payment system may determine at the reference time for the next monthly billing that a situation falling under
