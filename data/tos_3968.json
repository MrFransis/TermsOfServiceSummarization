"/html/body/div[1]/div[1]/div/main/div/div/div", "text": "Scope of Validity, Definition of Terms<p>These General Terms and Conditions apply to the use of the Kodi.tv website and all affiliated websites provided and maintained by the Kodi Foundation (hereafter called the \"Foundation\") and supported by the volunteers behind Kodi (hereafter called \"Team Kodi\").\nThis includes subsidiary sections such as the Kodi Forum (hereafter called the \"Forum\") and the Kodi Wiki (hereafter called the \"Wiki\").</p>\n<p>By registering on any of the Foundation websites, the user (hereafter called \"User\") enters into an agreement with the Foundation and declares that he/she/they accepts the terms set out below.\nThe agreement is applicable for an indefinite period of time.</p>\n<p>Using Kodi, the Foundation websites or any other service provided by the Foundation is only possible in conjunction with these Terms and Conditions.\nUsers accordingly accept that these Terms and Conditions form the basis for the use of those services.</p>\n<p>In relation to the Forum, these Terms of Service apply as part of the wider forum rules.</p>Facilities Provided<p>The main Foundation website hosts the main download source of Kodi.</p>\n<p>It also provides access to the latest news and blog posts from the Foundation, plus access to the Forum and the Wiki.</p>\n<p>The Forum is provided for use by the community of Kodi users (hereafter called the \"Community\")and is intended for discussion of Kodi and as the primary source of help and support.</p>\n<p>The Wiki is the main source of information for Kodi, and is maintained both by Team Kodi and also by the Community.</p>Registration and General Obligations<p>No registration is required to use the main Kodi website, or to download Kodi.</p>\n<p>Both the Forum and the Wiki can be browsed without requiring the registration of an account.</p>\n<p>Any User wishing to post or otherwise contribute to either must register an account.\nSuch registration is free of charge, and the two services are to be treated as separate entities with their own individual account registration requirements.</p>\n<p>These Terms of Service apply for all Users who have registered for the Forum and/or the Wiki.\nRegistration will be deemed valid if a User has conducted the registration process properly and has provided accurate particulars in full before clicking on \"Register\".</p>\n<p>No General Terms and Conditions on the part of the User or any other Conditions that deviate from or contradict these Terms shall be applicable.</p>\n<p>Users may not provide any registration data (for example, but not limited to, member\u2019s name, profile image, profile signature or associated hyperlinks) that is vulgar or offensive to others, nor are they permitted to impersonate other individuals or create a false identity (through the use of a celebrity or company name).</p>\n<p>When registering, Users are obliged to complete all the fields on the registration form truthfully and correctly.\nRegistration is only possible when all the compulsory fields have been filled in.</p>\n<p>Users may not take any action that might place an unreasonable or excessive burden on the Foundation or the facilities provided by it.</p>\n<p>Users may only register on the Forum with one user account at a time.</p>\n<p>An email address is required on the registration form to verify and confirm the validity of the registration request via a two step process, to prove that the application is genuine.\nThe Foundation may also use it to contact you in the case of account difficulties or reply to any contact you have made with us.</p>\n<p>The provided email address will not be used for tracking or marketing purposes, nor will it be shared with or sold to any third party agency.</p>\n<p>If the Foundation is unable to contact a User at the email address provided and the fault lies with the User (out-of-date address, failure to check his/her/their inbox, etc.), any disadvantages resulting thereof will be interpreted to the detriment of the User, i.e.\nthe email will be deemed delivered.</p>\n<p>When registering, Users have to choose a password with which to log on to the Forum or the Wiki using their account name.\nUsers undertake to keep their password secure, to employ a password of an appropriate strength and to partake in other standard security practices such as regularly changing the password.\nThe password may not be shared, divulged or revealed to third parties.</p>\n<p>It is not permitted to sell or transfer the members account to any third parties.\nThe same applies to other persons using a member\u2019s account.</p>Costs<p>Registration of accounts on the Foundation websites are free of charge, as is downloading Kodi itself from the Foundation website.</p>Suspension of User Accounts, Termination of Membership<p>The Foundation exercises domiciliary rights over the Kodi websites.\nIn the event of any breach of these Terms and Conditions, laws and/or any other regulations, the Foundation is entitled to exclude Users temporarily or permanently from using the Kodi website and the services provided without prior notice and to issue a house ban.</p>\n<p>To this end, Users will allow the Foundation to block their user accounts and any information or posts that may have been made.</p>Rights of Use<p>By posting contents on the Forum or the Wiki, Users grant the Foundation a simple, temporally and spatially unlimited and royalty-free right to use the contributions within the context of Kodi.\nThis right of use includes in particular the right to make contents publicly accessible worldwide via the Kodi website or, under certain circumstances, other media, to duplicate and distribute them or to transfer them to third parties (such as Facebook, press images, blogs).</p>\n<p>Granting these rights does not enable the Foundation to appropriate the Users contents in the context of any liability standards but serves merely to simplify the administrative work and the implementation of the contents when operating the Foundation website or promoting Kodi.</p>Data Protection<p>The Foundation processes the personal particulars of its Users for specific purposes in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>\n<p>The personal data (name, email address, account data etc.) required for registration for membership are used by the Foundation to conclude the registration on the website.\nThese data are treated as confidential and will not be forwarded to any third parties.</p>\n<p>Users have the right to ask for details of the personal particulars the Foundation has saved in their case.\nThis information will be provided free of charge.\nUsers are also entitled to have any incorrect particulars rectified should the need arise.</p>\n<p>The User may close his or her account at any time, with the option of removing personal data under GDPR rules.\nThis includes the replacement of the User name on any Forum posts made with an anonymous alternative, but it does not include the removal of the post information itself, nor any quotes of that information made by other Forum users.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the Foundation Privacy Policy, which forms part of these General Terms and Conditions, for further details regarding the handling of data and means of contact.</p>Amendments to the General Terms of Service<p>The Foundation is entitled to change these General Terms of Service and the data security guidelines.\nAmendments will only be made when there are sufficient, valid grounds and provided they do not distort the contractual balance between the Users and the Foundation.\nSuch reasons might include legal or technical changes, experience with user behaviour or unintentional gaps in the provisions.</p>\n<p>Users are entitled to challenge the changes.\nIn the event of any opposition, the Foundation reserves the right to terminate its contractual relationship with the user concerned with immediate effect.</p>\n<p>The changes shall be deemed to be acknowledged and binding if Users have not opposed them within the course of 14 days.</p>", "created_at": "2021-06-08 18:10:56.093528", "updated_at": "2021-06-08 16:15:19.250593"}, {"id": 6816, "name": "Privacy Policy", "url": "https://kodi.tv/about/privacy-policy/", "xpath": "/html/body/div[1]/div[1]/div/main/div/div/div", "text": "<p>2017 Mar 17</p>Introduction<p>Your privacy is an important factor that the Kodi Foundation and Team Kodi considers in the development of all of our software and services.\nWe are committed to being transparent and open.\nThis Privacy Policy explains generally how we receive information about you, and what we do with that information once we have it.</p>What do we mean by \u201cpersonal information\u201d?<p>For us, \u201cpersonal information\u201d means information which identifies you, like your name or email address.</p>\n<p>Any information that falls outside of this is \u201cnon-personal information\u201d.</p>\n<p>If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information.\nIf we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.</p>How do we learn information about you?<p>We learn information about you when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us logs in the forums)</li>\n<li>We collect it automatically through our software and services (e.g., when your Kodi connects with our servers to update add-ons, or in download statistics provided by Google Play)</li>\n<li>When we try and understand more about you based on information you\u2019ve given to us (e.g., when we use your platform information provided to the add-on server to figure out which platforms use Kodi the most, to better understand where we should focus our efforts)</li>\n<li>You visit the website, wiki, or forum (We employ Google Analytics on our website, which may use cookies for the purposes of tracking how many unique visits we get to the site, and where, generally, they come from.\nTo learn more, visit the Google Analytics wiki page.)</li>\n</ul>What do we do with your information once we have it?<p>Generally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our software and services for you (e.g., we use a log you send us to figure out why Kodi isn\u2019t playing a video right or why it might have crashed, or we determine how many active users are using each platform in order to determine how to allocate resources per platform).</p>When do we share your information with others?<ul>\n<li>When we have asked and received your permission to share it.</li>\n<li>When we are fulfilling our educational purpose.\nWe sometimes publicly release information to make our software better and foster an open web, but when we do so, we will remove your personal information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.\nFor example, here is a blog post where we attempt to analyze from available data how many active users of Kodi existed at the time and share that info with the community.</li>\n<li>When the law requires it.\nTo date, this has never happened, and we do not anticipating it happening in the future, as the majority of the information we collect is already almost entirely anonymous and never shows unique user behavior, except in voluntarily submitted logs on our forum.</li>\n<li>If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.</li>\n</ul>How do we store and protect your personal information?<p>We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it.\nWe implement physical, business and technical security measures.\nDespite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we\u2019ll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.</p>\n<p>We also don\u2019t want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for.\nOnce we don\u2019t need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.\nIn the case of logs provided to us in the forums, our servers do not store those logs, and we rely on the users submitting those logs to remove the links when they deem appropriate.\nWhat else should you know?</p>\n<p>We\u2019re a global organization and our computers are in several different places around the world.\nWe also use service providers whose computers may also be in various countries.\nThis means that your information might end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours.\nBy giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information.\nNo matter what country your information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.</p>\n<p>If you are under 13, we don\u2019t want your personal information, and you must not provide it to us.\nIf you are a parent and believe that your child who is under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us to have your child\u2019s information removed.</p>What if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?<p>We may need to change this policy and our notices.\nThe updates will be posted online.\nIf the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Kodi\u2019s usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums.\nYour continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.\nTo make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at the top of the page.</p>History<p>2017 Mar 17 - Changelog</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated how we learn about people to include information about Google Analytics and how it works and the fact

under the control of the Kodi Foundation, or if it is contained in a third party add-on or repository that is not hosted within the official Kodi Foundation repository, then the Kodi Foundation has no responsibility or liability for it.</p>\n<p>In such cases, any DMCA takedown request should be made to the author and/or owner of the addon, repository or website.</p>\n<p>For cases where an addon or repository in question is hosted within the Kodi Foundation repository, then the Kodi Foundation will aim to assist in identifying the author of the item, and will work with all parties to resolve the issue, and if required remove the item from the official repository.</p>Counter-Notification<p>If you want to send the Kodi Foundation a counter notice, please review this information for instructions.</p>\n<p>Under Section 512(f) of the Copyright Act, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.</p>\n<p>Please consult the Kodi Foundation Terms of Service in which we explain that you may be removed from the site if you are a repeat infringer or if you violate the Kodi
