terms\nWe know it\u2019s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it\u2019s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Logically services, and what we expect from you.\n<p>These Terms of Service reflect the way that Logically\u2019s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things that we\u2019ve always believed to be true.\nAs a result, these Terms of Service help define Logically\u2019s relationship with you as you interact with our services.\nFor example, these terms include the following topic headings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services</li>\n<li>What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services</li>\n<li>Content in Logically services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find in our services \u2013 whether that content belongs to you, Logically or others</li>\n<li>In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.</p>\n<p>Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy, and Logically Intelligence Terms of Service.</p>\nService provider\n<p>Logically services are provided by, and you\u2019re contracting with:</p>\n<p>TheLogically Ltd.</p>\n<p>Incorporated and operating under the laws of England and Wales</p>\n<p>Brookfoot Mills <br>Elland Road, West Yorkshire <br>HD62RW <br>UK</p>\nAge requirements\n<p>If you\u2019re under the age required to manage your own Logically Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian\u2019s permission to use a Logically Account.\nPlease ask your parent or legal guardian to read these terms with you.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you\u2019re responsible for your child\u2019s activity on the services.</p>\nYour relationship with Logically\n<p>These terms help define the relationship between you and Logically.\nBroadly speaking, we give you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Logically\u2019s business works and how we earn money.\nWhen we speak of 'Logically', 'we', 'us' and 'our', we mean TheLogically Ltd.\nand its affiliates.</p>\nWhat you can expect from us\nProvide a broad range of useful services\n<p>We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>apps and sites (such as Logically)</li>\n<li>platforms (such as Logically Intelligence)</li>\n<li>integrated services (such as Fact-checking embedded in other companies' apps or sites)</li>\n</ul>\nImprove Logically services\n<p>We\u2019re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services.\nFor example, we invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block problematic content, and to provide you with innovative features like credibility assessment.\nAs part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.</p>\n<p>We maintain a rigorous product research programme, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others.\nWe only change or stop offering services for valid reasons, such as to improve performance or security, to comply with law, to prevent illegal activities or abuse, to reflect technical developments or because a feature or an entire service is no longer popular enough or economical to offer.</p>\n<p>If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements or addressing security and operability issues.</p>\nWhat we expect from you\nFollow these terms and service-specific additional terms\n<p>The permission that we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in these terms and Logically Intelligence Terms.</p>\n<p>We also make various policies, Help Centres and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services.\nThese resources include our Privacy Policy, Transparency Policy and other pages accessible from our site.</p>\n<p>Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in the services.</p>\nRespect others\n<p>Some of our services may allow you to interact with others.\nWe want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means that you must follow these basic rules of conduct:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions and human trafficking laws</li>\n<li>respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights</li>\n<li>don\u2019t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) \u2013 for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing or stalking others</li>\n<li>don\u2019t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you find that others aren\u2019t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse directly or by emailing us on contact@logically.ai..</p>\nPermission to use your content\n<p>Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive or share your content.\nYou have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you\u2019re free to choose the content that you want to provide.\nIf you choose to upload or share content, please make sure that you have that the content is lawful.</p>\nLicence\n<p>Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content.\nFor example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content that you make, such as reviews that you write.\nOr you may have the right to share someone else\u2019s creative content if they\u2019ve given you their permission.</p>\n<p>We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content.\nYou provide Logically with that permission through this licence.</p>\nWhat's covered\n<p>This licence covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property

for the limited purpose of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>operating and improving the services</strong>, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and

wrote.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>developing new technologies and services</strong> for Logically consistent with these terms</li>\n</ul>\nDuration\n<p>This licence lasts for as long as your content is

website.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re responsible for what you do with your Logically Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Logically Account secure.</p>\nUsing Logically services on behalf

authorised representative of that organisation must agree to these terms and the terms set out here.\n[Link to logically intelligence terms]</li>\n<li>your organisation\u2019s administrator may assign

content\n<p>Some of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available \u2013 for example, you might post a claim in our apps, or share content on the shadow open network in our browser extensions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See the Permission to use your content section for more about your rights in your content, and how your content is used in our services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think that someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement via email to legal@logically.ai and we\u2019ll take appropriate action.</p>\nLogically

any part of our services or software.\nAlso, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets you do so.</p>\n<p>When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available.\nSome services let you adjust your automatic update settings.</p>\nIn case of problems or disagreements\nWarranty\n<p>We provide our services using reasonable skill and care.\nIf we don\u2019t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we\u2019ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.</p>\nDisclaimers\n<p>The only commitments that we make about our services (including the

service-specific additional terms or (3) provided under applicable laws.\nWe don\u2019t make any other commitments about our services.</p>\nLiabilities\nFor all users\n<p>These terms only limit our

and its directors, officers, employees and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or additional terms outlined by the Logically Intelligence Terms of Service.\nThis indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages,

responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don\u2019t apply to you under these terms.\nFor example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don\u2019t override those immunities.</p>\nTaking action in case of problems\n<p>Before taking action as described below, we\u2019ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably

party or Logically</li>\n<li>violate the law or a legal enforcement authority\u2019s order</li>\n<li>compromise an investigation</li>\n<li>compromise the operation, integrity or security of our services</li>\n</ul>\nRemoving your content\n<p>If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties or Logically, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law.\nExamples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, and content that infringes someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights.</p>\nSuspending or terminating your access to Logically services\n<p>Logically reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Logically Account if any of these things happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you materially or repeatedly breach these terms</li>\n<li>we\u2019re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order</li>\n<li>we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party or Logically \u2013 for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others or scraping content that doesn\u2019t belong to you.\nUnauthorised scraping of content from Logically services may lead to a penalty of upto \u00a3100 million.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you believe that your Logically Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.</p>\n<p>Of course, you\u2019re always free to stop using our services at any time.\nIf you do stop using a service, we\u2019d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.</p>\nSettling disputes, governing law and courts\n<p>For information about how to contact Logically, please visit our contact page.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a resident of, or an organisation based in the United Kingdom, these terms and your relationship with Logically under these terms and service-specific additional terms, are governed by English law, and you can file legal disputes in the English courts.</p>\nAbout these terms\n<p>By law, you have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract like these Terms of Service.\nThese terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.</p>\n<p>These terms describe the relationship between you and Logically.\nThey don\u2019t create any legal rights for other people or organisations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.</p>\n<p>We want to make these terms easy to understand.\nBut not all the services mentioned may be available to you or in your country.</p>\n<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t follow these terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.</p>\n<p>We may update these terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business \u2013 for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory or security reasons or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.</p>\n<p>If we materially change these terms, we'll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.\nIf you don't agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services.\nYou can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Logically Account.</p>\n&nbsp.\nLogically

its users to customise their reading experience and enable personalised distribution of content in relation to the interests of users.\nLogically shares minimal data with its service providers.</p>\nPurpose of Processing\n<ul>\n<li>Provide, test, promote, and improve Logically services</li>\n<li>Gather usage statistics of services</li>\n<li>Gather usage statistics of services</li>\n<li>Fight spam, fraud, and other abuse of services</li>\n</ul>\nOur Legal Bases for processing data\n<p>In order to provide our services, Logically collects and stores personal data about its users on the legal basis of consent given when you create an account and agree to the Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Logically also pursues its legitimate interests by collecting minimal data of logged out users to provide the services, as outlined above.</p>\n<p>Where Logically collects and stores personal data about non-users, it does so under performance of contract obligations with users who use the services to publish content on web sites hosted by Logically.\nIn such cases, users authoring such content containing personal data of third parties are responsible for that content.\nLogically will consider related complaints in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation\u2019s rights of the data subject, as well as rights of expression and access to information.</p>\nPublic Nature of Personal Data\n<p>Logged-in users may choose to interact publicly with the Logically Services through using the site's comment function.\nWhere such personal data may reveal special category protected data, it is processed on the basis that it is manifestly made public by the user, although it is advised that users do not share such data through commenting.\nAdditional information on potential consequences of such processing can be found below.\nIf you don't agree to this public usage, do not create an account or use these features of Logically's Services.</p>\nCategories of Personal Data Collected\n<p>Logged out users</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading history</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>Browser information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Logged in users</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Username</li>\n<li>Display name</li>\n<li>Bio</li>\n<li>Email address (non-public)</li>\n<li>Session activity (security)</li>\n<li>Linked social media accounts (optional)</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>Browser information</li>\n<li>Reading history</li>\n<li>Network interactions (comments, people or entities followed, etc.)</li>\n<li>Comments and responses</li>\n</ul>\nCategories of Recipients\n<p>Logically shares personal data with third-party processors although this is kept to a minimum and solely shared for the purpose of providing

&amp.\nOther Infrastructure</li>\n<li>Security</li>\n<li>Analytics</li>\n<li>Communication &amp.\nSupport</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Search engines will index public interactions and user profiles.\nUsers may also share links which contain your comments on social media.</p>\nEmbedded Content\n<p>Logically often uses content hosted on other sites (third-party embeds) which may collect and store personal data.\nThis content is not hosted on Logically, therefore third party embeds on Logically services are not covered by this policy, but by the policies of the third-party sites or services.</p>\nExistence of Automated Decision-making\n<p>Logically collects and stores personal data about its users to customise reading.\nAutomated Decision-making is used to promote content tailored to users interests, preferences and previous use of Logically services.</p>\n<p>Logically also filters content for the purposes of fighting and preventing spam, fraud, and other forms of abuse.</p>\nPotential Consequences Data Processing\n<p>By creating an account on Logically, users may make certain personal data about themselves public and accessible to others on their profile through commenting within the debate section of Logically's services.\nThis may in some cases constitute special category protected data which is considered manifestly made public by the user, dependent on what parts of your profile you share and the comments you make.</p>\n<p>It may be possible for third parties to derive identifying personal data from posts, whether by reading, inference, supplemental research, or automated extraction and analysis, due to the public nature of information posted to Logically.</p>\n<p>Users are free to use their real name and information, or a pseudonym of their choosing, for their account.\nUsers may also choose to use the service without posting data or engaging in network interactions.\nHowever, if you do not agree with and accept the risks of such usage, you may not use the services.</p>\nCross-border Transfers\n<p>Logically is hosted in the United States.\nIn the use of Logically Services, you authorise Logically to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate.\nWhere your data is disclosed to our processors, it is subject by contract to at least the same level of data

any time which will delete all of your personal information.\nUpon deletion your account will be unrecoverable in our system after a period of fourteen days.\nIt may take several additional days for
