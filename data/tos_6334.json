ownership rights in intellectual property that you share with the forum, such as your account information, posts, or other content you submit to the forum.\nNothing in these terms gives you any

imply that content you submit to the forum is sponsored or approved by the company.\nThese terms do not obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you submit, and to change it, according to these terms.</p>\n<p>Content you submit to the forum belongs to you, and you decide what permission to give others for it.\nBut at a minimum, you license the company to provide content that you submit to the forum to other users of the forum.\nThat special license allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the forum.</p>\n<p>When content you submit is removed from the forum, whether by you or by the company, the company\u2019s special license ends when the last copy disappears from the company\u2019s backups, caches, and other systems.\nOther licenses you apply to content you submit, such as Creative Commons licenses, may continue after your content is removed.\nThose licenses may give others, or the company itself, the right to share your content through the forum again.</p>\n<p>Others who receive content you submit to the forum may violate the terms on which you license your content.\nYou agree that the company will not be liable to you for those violations or their consequences.</p>\nYour Responsibility\n<p>You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account on the forum.\nBoth you and the company agree to notify the other side of any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as possible.\nIf the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you won\u2019t have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended against or mitigated with prompt notice.\nYou agree to allow the company to control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts.\nThe company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.</p>\nDisclaimers\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>You accept all risk of using the forum and content on the forum.\nAs far as the law allows, the company and its suppliers provide the forum as is, without any warranty whatsoever.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>The forum may hyperlink

others.</p>\nTermination\n<p>Either you or the company may end the agreement written out in these terms at any time.\nWhen our agreement ends, your permission to use the forum also ends.</p>\n<p>The following provisions survive the end of our agreement: Your Content, Feedback, Your Responsibility, Disclaimers, Limits on Liability, and General Terms.</p>\nDisputes\n<p>governing_law will govern any dispute related to these terms or your use of the forum.</p>\n<p>You and the company agree to seek injunctions related to these terms only in state or federal court in city_for_disputes.\nNeither you nor the company will object to jurisdiction, forum, or venue in those courts.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Other than to seek an injunction or for claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, you and the company will resolve any dispute by binding American Arbitration Association arbitration.\nArbitration will follow the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nArbitration will happen in city_for_disputes.\nYou will settle any dispute as an individual, and not as part of a class action or other representative proceeding, whether as the plaintiff or a class member.\nNo arbitrator will consolidate any dispute with any other arbitration without the company\u2019s permission.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Any arbitration award will include costs of the arbitration, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and reasonable costs for witnesses.\nYou and the company may enter arbitration awards in any court with jurisdiction.</p>\nGeneral Terms\n<p>If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.\nOtherwise, that provision should be removed.</p>\n<p>You may not assign your agreement with the company.\nThe company may assign your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company related to the forum.\nAny attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.</p>\n<p>Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and the company about use of the forum.\nThese terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the forum, written or not.</p>\nContact\n<p>You may notify the company under these terms, and send questions to the company, at ouyasaviors@gmail.com.</p>\n<p>The company may notify you under these terms using the e-mail address you provide for your account on the forum, or by posting a message to the homepage of the forum or your account page.</p>\nChanges\n<p>The company last updated these terms on July 12, 2018, and may update these terms again.\nThe company will post all updates to the forum.\nFor updates that contain substantial changes, the company agrees to e-mail you, if you\u2019ve created an account and provided a valid e-mail address.\nThe company may also announce updates with special messages or alerts on the forum.</p>\n<p>Once you get notice of an update to these terms, you must agree to the new terms in order to keep using the forum.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Home </li>\n<li> Categories </li>\n<li> FAQ/Guidelines </li>\n<li> Terms of Service </li>\n<li> Privacy Policy </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Powered by Discourse, best viewed with JavaScript
