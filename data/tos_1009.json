without prior notification, to limit the order quantity on any item or to refuse to provide you with any item.\nYou may be required to verify your transaction information prior to our acceptance thereof.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding these Terms, the laws in your country may apply to the purchase of virtual goods and services supplied by Nexon to you and you may have rights or remedies as set out in such laws that apply in addition to, or, to the extent that they are inconsistent, instead of, the rights or remedies set out in these Terms.</p>\n<p>As for the Services provided in Japan, only

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.</p>\n<p>In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, Nexon and you both agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to the Services (\u201cDispute\u201d) will be resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law:</p>\n<p>Notice of Dispute.\nIn the event of a Dispute, you or we must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution.\nYou must send any Notice of Dispute by mail and email to us at the mailing and email addresses provided in the Contact Us section.\nWe will send any Notice of Dispute to you by mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address.</p>\n<p>Small Claims Court.\nYou may choose to litigate any Dispute in small claims court (or the equivalent) in the Forum specified in Section IX, if the Dispute meets all the requirements to be heard in small claims court.</p>\n<p>Binding Arbitration.\nIf the Dispute is not resolved in small claims court, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section.\nYou are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury.\nInstead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act or any other applicable law.\nAny court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p>Exceptions to Arbitration.\nYou and Nexon agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Nexon\u2019s intellectual property rights.</li>\n<li>Any claim for injunctive relief.</li>\n<li>Any claim you are authorized to bring to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, permit those authorities to seek relief from us on your behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Class Action Waiver.\nAny proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis.\nNeither you nor we will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity.\nNo arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Procedures.\nAny arbitration will be conducted by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (\u201cJAMS\u201d) under the applicable Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the Dispute is filed.\nIf JAMS is unavailable or unable to conduct an arbitration of the Dispute, an alternative arbitration service provider will be mutually agreed upon by both parties.\nYou may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS rules.\nIn a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.\nThe arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.\nThe arbitrator may award relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</p>\n<p>Arbitrator\u2019s Jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Fees.\nWhoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee.\nIf we file, we pay.\nIf you file, you pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules.\nAll other fees will be allocated as provided by the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law.\nEach party will bear the expense of that party\u2019s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</p>\n<p>Location of Arbitration.\nYou agree that the arbitration will occur in the following location:</p>\n<p>Game Publisher</p>\n<p>Arbitration Forum</p>\n<p>Nexon America Inc.</p>\n<p>A reasonable location in the United States, as agreed to by both parties, or, if necessary, as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Nexon Korea Corporation</p>\n<p>A reasonable location in South Korea, as agreed to by both parties, or, if necessary, as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Disputes Must Be Filed Within One Year.\nTo the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under this agreement must be filed within one year in small claims court or in an arbitration proceeding.\nThe one-year period begins when the Dispute or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.\nIf a Dispute isn\u2019t filed within one year, it\u2019s permanently barred.</p>\n<p>Temporary Injunctive Relief.\nBefore the appointment of an arbitrator, either party may seek temporary injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without waiving its right to arbitration.</p>\n<p>If this agreement to arbitrate is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the parties agree to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law that any Dispute relating to your use of the Services or these Terms shall be commenced and heard in accordance with Section IX.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>XI.\nMISCELLANEOUS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Entire Agreement.\nThese Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us.</p>\n<p>Relationship of Parties.\nYou agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or your access to and use of the Services.</p>\n<p>Severability.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed.\nThe remainder of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.\nThe severed provision will be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision.</p>\n<p>Assignment.\nThis agreement may not be assigned, in whole or part, whether voluntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise, by you without the prior written consent of Nexon.\nNexon may assign, license, delegate or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder to any third party without restriction.\nSubject to the preceding sentences, the rights and liabilities of the parties hereto are binding on, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.\nAny attempted assignment other than in accordance with this Section shall be null and void.</p>\n<p>Captions and Headings.\nThe captions and section and paragraph headings used in the Terms are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of the Terms.</p>\n<p>Waiver.\nOur failure to enforce any provisions of these Terms or respond to a violation by any party does not waive our right to subsequently enforce any terms or conditions of the Terms or respond to any violations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>XII.\nCONTACT
