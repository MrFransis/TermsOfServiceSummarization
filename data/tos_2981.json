Integritet AB (556999-4469).\nOVPN Integritet AB is registered in Sweden and will henceforth be referred to as \"We\", \"Us\", \"Our\" and \"OVPN\".\n</p>\n<p> OVPN is the privacy friendly VPN provider.\nAs such, our entire infrastructure is built with privacy &amp.\nsecurity as the core principles.\nOVPN does not log any activity when connected to our VPN service.\nTherefore, we do not know who is connected to our service, what they are doing or when they are doing it.\nNothing can be connected to an account: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>no logging of traffic</li>\n<li>no logging of timestamps</li>\n<li>no logging of DNS requests</li>\n<li>no logging of IP addresses</li>\n<li>no logging of MAC addresses</li>\n<li>no logging of individual user bandwidth volumes</li>\n</ul>\n<p> We

as well as syslogs.\nOur VPN servers do not support physical console access, keyboard access nor usb access.\n</p> Court orders <p> OVPN can not provide any activity information or logs about users if a court order was issued asking us to provide that information.\nAs previously mentioned, no information about what our users do when connected is stored.\n</p>\n<p> The only information we would be able to provide would be account information detailed further below as well as the method of payment.\nHowever, it requires that the court order is for a specific person and that the authorities want to verify if that person has a user account with us.\nWe have not provided any information about our users to any government entities.\n</p> Website <p> Our website runs on a physical machine that we own and is located in our Stockholm datacenter.\nWe use the following third-party services: </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Matomo (previously named Piwik)</strong>: Matomo is included so we can measure how users interact with the website and to find areas of improvement.\nAll IP addresses are anonymized.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intercom</strong>: Intercom is a support system which we use to offer support to our
