modified Terms on the Sites or through other communications.\nIt is important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Service after we have posted modified Terms on the Sites, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms.\nIf you do not agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Service anymore.\nBecause our Service is evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Service, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>\n<strong>Privacy</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Please review our privacy practices to understand what information we collect and how we use it.\nOur privacy policy is located at

Policy.</p>\n<strong>Registration</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>The Products and Service are available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract with us.\nIf you want to use certain features of the Service, such as purchasing our Products, you will have to create an account (<strong>\u201cAccount\u201d</strong>).\nYou can do this via our Sites or through your account with certain third-party social networking services such as Facebook or Twitter (each, an <strong>\u201cSNS Account\u201d</strong>).\nIf you choose the SNS Account option we will create your Account by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information such as your name and email address and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.</p>\n<p>It is important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to- date information for your Account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to- date.\nIf you don\u2019t, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account.\nYou agree that you won\u2019t disclose your Account password to anyone and you\u2019ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account.\nYou\u2019re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.</p>\n<strong>Purchases</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>\n<u>Order Processing</u>\n</p>\n<p>You can purchase our Products by placing orders via our Sites or the App.\nTouchOfModern reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse to process or to cancel your order in certain circumstances.\nThis may happen, for example, when the Product you ordered is out of stock, there are inaccuracies or errors in Products or pricing information, or our credit and fraud avoidance department identifies problems or in other circumstances that we, in our sole discretion, deem appropriate.\nTouchOfModern also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps to verify your identity to process your order.\nWe will not charge you for orders that we do not process or cancel.\nIf we have already charged you for your order, then we will refund you the amount charged.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Fees and Payment</u>\n</p>\n<p>You will be charged immediately upon placing an order.\nTouchOfModern will use commercially reasonable efforts to have orders delivered within the estimated delivery time.\nHowever, sometimes items may be delayed due to factors beyond our control, and we will not be liable for any such delays.\nIf you are making payment by credit card, you hereby authorize TouchOfModern or its third party payment processing service providers to charge your credit card for the price of the Products you have purchased.</p>\n<p>TouchOfModern reserves the right to require payment of fees for certain features of the Service.\nShould you elect to subscribe to or use such features, you agree to pay all applicable fees, as described on the Sites or the App in connection with such features.\nTouchOfModern reserves the right to change its price list, product and service offerings, and to institute new charges at any time.\nUse of the Service by you following such notification constitutes your acceptance of any new or increased charges or prices.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Product Descriptions</u>\n</p>\n<p>We attempt to provide accurate descriptions of Products on our Sites and the App.\nHowever, there may be inaccuracies in the Product descriptions, or the colors of the Products may vary from one monitor to another.\nAccordingly, TouchOfModern does not warrant that the Product descriptions, colors, images or videos are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.\nIf a Product offered on our Sites is not as described, your sole remedy is to contact us in accordance with our Return Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Pricing and Discount Information</u>\n</p>\n<p>We strive to provide accurate pricing information about Products.\nWe cannot, however, insure against pricing errors.\nTouchOfModern reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse to process or cancel any orders placed for a Product whose price was incorrectly posted on the Sites as a result of an error.\nIf this occurs, TouchOfModern will notify you by email.\nIn addition, TouchOfModern reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to correct any errors in the listed price on its Sites.</p>\n<p>We display discounts on our Sites or the App in connection with each Product.\nDiscounts are calculated using pricing information provided to us by merchants (such as suggested retail prices from the manufacturer, supplier, or the merchant, or an estimated price based on standard industry practice).</p>\n<p>\n<u>Product Availability and Delivery</u>\n</p>\n<p>Our Sites or the App may contain information regarding the availability of the Products.\nUnfortunately, TouchOfModern cannot guarantee that an item listed as \"in stock\" will actually ship right away, as inventory can change significantly from day-to- day.\nIn some cases, a Product that may be in stock when a customer places the order, may be sold out by the time TouchOfModern attempts to process the order, or there may be an error in the information about the availability of the Product.\nShould this happen, TouchOfModern will notify you by email.\nIf we determine that a Product you ordered is no longer available, we will cancel that item from your order and provide you a full refund towards the cancelled Product, if you have already paid for it.\nWe will notify you about the cancelation by email.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Return Policy</u>\n</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise required by law, TouchOfModern accepts returns on certain Products on a case-by- case basis.\nIf, however, a Product is listed as final sale, we will not accept returns for such Product, unless it is defective.\nIf a Product offered by TouchOfModern is defective, please send an email to support@touchofmodern.com within 48 hours of receiving the Product, unless a longer time is required by law.\nWe will either replace the defective product or issue a full refund.\nFor more information on our Return Policy and how we handle Returns, please check our FAQs.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Risk of Loss</u>\n</p>\n<p>The risk of loss and title for such all items purchased from TouchofModern pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Assumption of Risk for Products You Purchase</u>\n</p>\n<p>You understand that TouchofModern does not manufacture or inspect any of the Products sold through our Sites or the App.\nWe provide the platform to facilitate such sales, but the Products are produced directly by independent manufacturers, so we cannot and do not make any warranties about their quality, safety, or even their legality.\nAny legal claim related to a Product you purchase must be brought directly against the manufacturer of the Product.\nYou release TouchofModern from any claims related to Products sold through our Service, including for defective items, misrepresentations by manufacturers, or items that cause physical injury (like product liability claims).</p>\n<strong>Ownership of the Sites and Service</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>All contents of the

will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>\n<u>\n</u>\n<p>\n<u>Agreement to Arbitrate</u>\n</p>\n<p> You and TouchOfModern agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Service (collectively, <strong>\"Disputes\"</strong>) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an <strong>\"IP Protection Action\"</strong>).\nWithout limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide TouchOfModern with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at support@touchofmodern.com or 1025 Sansome St, San Francisco, CA 94111 within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an <strong>\"Arbitration Opt-out Notice\"</strong>).\nIf you do not provide TouchOfModern with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above.\nThe exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide TouchOfModern with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.\nUnless you timely provide TouchOfModern with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, <strong>you acknowledge and agree that you and TouchOfModern are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</strong> Further, unless both you and TouchOfModern otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \"Dispute Resolution\" section will be deemed void.\nExcept as provided in the preceding sentence, this \"Dispute Resolution\" section will survive any termination of these Terms.\n</p>\n<u>\n</u>\n<p>\n<u>Arbitration Rules</u>\n</p>\n<p> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>\"AAA\"</strong>) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the <strong>\"AAA Rules\"</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this \"Dispute Resolution\" section.\n(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\n</p>\n<u>\n</u>\n<p>\n<u>Arbitration Process</u>\n</p>\n<p> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written <u>Demand for Arbitration</u> as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitrationand a separate <u>Demand for Arbitration for California residents.</u>) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\n</p>\n<u>\n</u>\n<p>\n<u>Arbitration Location and Procedure</u>\n</p>\n<p> Unless you and TouchOfModern otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and TouchOfModern submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n</p>\n<u>\n</u>\n<p>\n<u>Arbitrator\u2019s Decision</u>\n</p>\n<p> The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the \"Limitation of Liability\" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.\nTouchOfModern will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.\n</p>\n<u>\n</u>\n<p>\n<u>Fees</u>\n</p>\n<p> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, TouchOfModern will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\n</p>\n<u>\n</u>\n<p>\n<u>Changes</u>\n</p>\n<p> Notwithstanding the provisions of the \"Modification of Terms\" section above, if TouchOfModern changes this \"Dispute Resolution\" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to www.TouchOfModern.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the \"Last Updated\" date above or in the date of TouchOfModern\u2019s email to you notifying you of such change.\nBy rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and TouchOfModern in accordance with the provisions of this \"Dispute Resolution\" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).\n</p>\n<strong>General Terms</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p> These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between TouchOfModern and you regarding the Service (including Products), and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between TouchOfModern and you regarding the Service (including Products).\nIf any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the \"Arbitration\" section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.\nYou may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without TouchOfModern\u2019s prior written consent.\nAny attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null.\n</p>\n<p> TouchOfModern may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.\nSubject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.\nAny notices or other communications provided by TouchOfModern under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email.\nor (ii) by posting to the Service.\nFor notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.\n</p>\n<p> TouchOfModern\u2019s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.\nThe waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of TouchOfModern.\nExcept as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.\n</p>\n<strong>Copyright and Trademark Notices</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p> Unless otherwise indicated, the Terms and all Content provided by TouchOfModern are copyright \u00a9 2012-2020
