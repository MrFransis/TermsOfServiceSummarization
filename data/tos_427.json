shall not be liable for any loss, damages or inconvenience resulting from such unavailability.</p>\n<p>We take great care in seeking to present accurate, transparent and useful information to you as a

use cookies to improve your experience on our site, Virgin.com, and to recommend content that may be of interest to you.\nYou can find out more below about what cookies are, the cookies we use and how to switch them off.</p>\n<p>You can indicate your acceptance to our use of cookies in accordance with this policy by clicking \u201cOK\u201d in the appropriate place on the banner that appears on Virgin.com.\nHowever, please note that if you do not click \u201cOK\u201d but continue to browse the site, you will be deemed to have accepted our use of cookies (and what we use them for) in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What are cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access a website.\nThe text file is then sent back to our server each time your browser requests a page from the server.\nThis enables us to operate the site more effectively and load the site so that it reflects your personal preferences, based on your previous browsing on Virgin.com as well as keywords we may be able to gather from URLs of other webpages from which you accessed Virgin.com.\nCookies can also allow us to do various other things, as explained below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What cookies do we use?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you visit Virgin.com, the following types of cookies may be downloaded to your device:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytical and Performance Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may use analytics service providers for website traffic analysis and reporting.\nAnalytics service providers generate statistical and other information about the use of Virgin.com by using cookies.\nThey allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the site, how long they stay and how visitors move around our site when they are using it.\nThis helps us to improve the way our site works, for example, it helps users to find what they are looking for easily.\nThe information generated relating to the site may be used to create reports about the use of the site and the analytics service provider will store this information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising and Targeting Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These cookies record your visit to Virgin.com, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to other sites.\nWe will use this information to try and make our site and other sites that you visit more relevant to your interests.\nWe may also share this information with others, such as other Virgin companies and carefully selected third parties, for this purpose.</p>\n<p>We work with technology partners to support our website and to provide you with relevant information about the products and services of other Virgin companies both on Virgin.com and on affiliated sites or sites within the advertising networks we work with.\nWe may use cookies on our site to help us to place relevant Virgin company advertising on third party websites when you visit those sites.\nIf you are not happy for us to do this, please see the section of this policy titled \u201cHow do I turn cookies off?\u201d below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Functionality Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may use functional cookies that allow us to remember choices you have made on the site so as to provide you with a more enhanced user experience by delivering content specific to your interests.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These are cookies that are required for the administration and operation of our site.\nSome cookies that we use are necessary for our site to function properly and to enable you to move around the site and use its features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Because Virgin and Richard have a strong presence on various social networks, we try and make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks.\nWe add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks.\nWe also use Facebook to power the commenting functionality on the site.\nWhen we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use their own cookies.\nThey can't read any cookies we set from Virgin.com, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of Virgin.com, and it also lets them know whether you're logged into their site.\nFor example, if you're logged in to Facebook, read a post by Richard Branson and want to make a comment, you can do that straight away without having to log in again - we never know whether you're logged in or not, as you communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our site.</p>\n<p>Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control.\nThese cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>As at 9th October 2017, we use the following third party
