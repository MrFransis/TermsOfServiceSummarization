correspondence.\n</p>\n<p>The information you give Us may include your name and e-mail.\n</p>\n<p>b) information We gather via the Platform (\u201cGathered Information\u201d): this\n</p>\n<p>is visual

Information\u201d): this is information\n</p>\n<p>We automatically gather via cookies which help to make the use of the Platform\n</p>\n<p>as smooth as possible for you.\n</p>\n<p>3.3.\nWe process the

requirement\n</p>\n<p>nor a requirement necessary to use the Services.\nThis means that you do not have\n</p>\n<p>any obligation to give Us your personal data and you can use the Services without\n</p>\n<p>giving Us any of your personal data.\n</p>\n<p>4.\nLEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA\n</p>\n<p>4.1.\nWe process your personal data because it is necessary for the fulfilment of a contract\n</p>\n<p>concluded between you and Us for providing you the Services (see clauses 3.1.a) and\n</p>\n<p>3.1.b)).\nor for taking steps at your request prior to entering into a contract

contract.\n</p>\n<p>4.2.\nWe also process your personal data to improve the Platform and the Avatar\n</p>\n<p>generation quality (see clause 3.1.c)).\nIn this case the legal ground for processing\n</p>\n<p>your personal data is your prior consent.\nIf you do not give Us your consent We will\n</p>\n<p>not process your personal data for that purpose.\nYou may at any time withdraw your\n</p>Seite 3 von 5<p>3\n</p>\n<p>consent by sending a respective notice to Our e-mail at support@wolf3d.io.\n</p>\n<p>Withdrawal of consent does not affect your right to use the Services and the\n</p>\n<p>Platform.\n</p>\n<p>4.3.\nFurthermore, We process your personal data (i.e.\nuse your e-mail address) for\n</p>\n<p>sending you information about updates to the Platform and to uses of the Avatar (see\n</p>\n<p>clause 3.1.d)).\nBut We do it only in the case where you have voluntarily given Us\n</p>\n<p>your e-mail address.\nThe legal basis for that is Our legitimate interest to keep you\n</p>\n<p>the in loop of any advancements which the Platform may get (e.g.\nnew customization\n</p>\n<p>options, etc.), any news about the Platform and any new use cases for the Avatar.\n</p>\n<p>You always have the possibility to unsubscribe from such e-mails by clicking on a link\n</p>\n<p>which is provided under each e-mail.\nIf you unsubscribe, We will no longer send you\n</p>\n<p>such e-mails.\n</p>\n<p>4.4.\nWe also process your personal data for enforcing and defending Our legal rights under\n</p>\n<p>legitimate interest pursued by Us (see clause 3.1.e)).\nIt is Our legitimate interest to\n</p>\n<p>enforce and defend Our legal rights as We see it necessary.\n</p>\n<p>4.5.\nAlso, We process personal data for complying with legal or regulatory obligations or\n</p>\n<p>requests (see clause 3.1.f)) as processing is necessary for compliance with the legal\n</p>\n<p>obligations to which We are subject to.\n</p>\n<p>5.\nDISLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA\n</p>\n<p>5.1.\nWe will not disclose your personal data to third parties except for the following cases:\n</p>\n<p>a) Cloud-server service provider(s).\nWe transfer data to cloud servers where We\n</p>\n<p>store all Our data, for example to Amazon servers in USA (Amazon Web\n</p>\n<p>Services, Inc.).\nThe standard contractual clauses established by the European\n</p>\n<p>Commission are applied to the transfer and processing of the personal data.\n</p>\n<p>b) Other group members.\nWe have the right to disclose your personal information\n</p>\n<p>to any member of Our group, which means Our subsidiaries and Our ultimate\n</p>\n<p>holding company and its subsidiaries.\nSuch transfer will only be done if it is\n</p>\n<p>necessary for the provision of the Services to You.\n</p>\n<p>c) Asset transfer parties.\nIn the event that We sell or buy any business or assets,\n</p>\n<p>in which case We will disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or\n</p>\n<p>buyer of such business or assets.\nIf Wolfprint 3D O\u00dc or substantially all of its\n</p>\n<p>assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it\n</p>\n<p>about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.\n</p>\n<p>d) Legal authorities, institutions and other parties under law.\nIf We are under a\n</p>\n<p>duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal\n</p>\n<p>or regulatory obligation or request.\nIn order to:\n</p>\n<p>i.\ninvestigate potential breaches.\nor\n</p>\n<p>ii.\nprotect the rights, property or safety of Our customers, or others.\nThis\n</p>\n<p>includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations\n</p>\n<p>for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\n</p>\n<p>5.2.\nWhere We do share your information with third parties, We will require such third\n</p>\n<p>parties to comply with this Privacy Policy and maintain appropriate security to protect\n</p>\n<p>your information from unauthorised access or processing, unless We have no ability\n</p>\n<p>to do so (for example, where We are sharing information with regulatory authorities\n</p>\n<p>or courts).\n</p>\n<p>6.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIRD PARTIES\n</p>Ready Player Me Privacy Policy 2021-01-19.pdfReady Player Me Privacy Policy

the Platform) the\n</p>\n<p>Platform may be framed into one of our partners\u2019 web applications (\u201cPartner\u201d and\n</p>\n<p>\u201cPartner\u2019s Application\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>2.2.\nThese Terms apply only to your use of the Services (and the Platform) as framed\n</p>\n<p>but not to usage of any of the sites and services provided by the Partner or any\n</p>\n<p>other third party.\n</p>\n<p>3.\nACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS\n</p>\n<p>3.1.\nIt is essential that you thoroughly read, understand and accept the Terms as well\n</p>\n<p>as the Privacy Policy of the Platform.\n</p>\n<p>3.2.\nBy clicking \u201cTake a photo!\u201d or \u201cContinue without a photo\u201d, you confirm that you\n</p>\n<p>have read the Terms, that you understand it and that you agree to be bound by it.\n</p>\n<p>Bear in mind \u2013 the Terms are obligatory and legally binding to all Users.\nIf you do\n</p>\n<p>not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services (including the Platform) in\n</p>\n<p>any manner.\n</p>\n<p>3.3.\nBy accepting the Terms, you and Wolf3D enter into an agreement of unspecified\n</p>\n<p>term under which you have the right to use the

7<p>2\n</p>\n<p>5.\nCREATING AND MAKING THE AVATAR AVAILABLE\n</p>\n<p>5.1.\nIn order to create an Avatar, you must:\n</p>\n<p>a) choose the gender of the Avatar (the algorithms for the creation of Avatars\n</p>\n<p>for sexes vary slightly).\n</p>\n<p>b) either:\n</p>\n<p>i.\ntake a photo of your face (selfie) using the forward facing camera of your\n</p>\n<p>device (for that we request access to your device\u2019s camera) with a neutral\n</p>\n<p>facial expression and good lighting or choose an existing photo that meets\n</p>\n<p>the same requirements.\nAlso, make sure that your hair (or anything else)\n</p>\n<p>does not cover your face.\nRemove you glasses if you are wearing them.\n</p>\n<p>This photo is used as a basis for the Avatar.\n</p>\n<p>or\n</p>\n<p>ii.\ncontinue without a photo in which case a standard Avatar is taken as the\n</p>\n<p>basis.\n</p>\n<p>c) customise the Avatar (e.g.\nselect hair style, colour, accessories, etc.).\n</p>\n<p>5.2.\nWhen customizing the Avatar we do not expect you to enter correct data about your\n</p>\n<p>appearance because the Avatar is not meant to be an exact copy of you.\nWe hope\n</p>\n<p>that you are creative and let your imagination run its course.\n</p>\n<p>5.3.\nOnce the customization is finished by you, the Avatar data file is created on the\n</p>\n<p>Platform.\n</p>\n<p>5.4.\nWhere you are using the Platform via the Partner\u2019s Application, you hereby give us\n</p>\n<p>authorisation to make the Avatar available to the respective Partner so it can be\n</p>\n<p>used in the Partner\u2019s Application.\n</p>\n<p>5.5.\nYou also have a possibility to copy the link for using the Avatar in other\n</p>\n<p>environments and make the Avatar available therein.\nThe respective instructions\n</p>\n<p>are given at the Platform and/or in those other environments.\n</p>\n<p>5.6.\nWe keep the right to retain the created Avatar in our server.\nHowever, we do not\n</p>\n<p>have the obligation to retain it.\nIf you wish, you can view and customize your Avatar\n</p>\n<p>later by visiting the Platform as long as you have not deleted the cookies sent by\n</p>\n<p>the Platform to your device from creating the Avatar.\nOnce you delete these cookies,\n</p>\n<p>you are not able to access your Avatar from the Platform.\n</p>\n<p>6.\nUSING THE AVATAR\n</p>\n<p>6.1.\nOnce the Avatar has been created you can use the Avatar in any environment where\n</p>\n<p>it is made available, including in the Partner\u2019s Application, to the extent that:\n</p>\n<p>a) the Avatar is not used inappropriately or for any immoral, illegal, abusive or\n</p>\n<p>harmful purpose at the sole discretion of Wolf3D \u2013 for example, it is prohibited\n</p>\n<p>to use the Avatar for political reasons and/or in the adult entertainment\n</p>\n<p>industry.\n</p>\n<p>b) the reputation of Wolf3D nor the respective Partner\u2019s is in any way harmed or\n</p>\n<p>decreased.\nand\n</p>Seite 3 von 7<p>3\n</p>\n<p>c) other terms and conditions of these Terms have been fully complied with.\n</p>\n<p>6.2.\nYou hereby agree that it is at our sole discretion to decide whether any use of the\n</p>\n<p>Avatar complies with these Terms or not and in the latter case it is at our sole\n</p>\n<p>discretion to request you or the respective Partner to stop the usage of the Avatar.\n</p>\n<p>Upon receiving such request, you shall stop using the Avatar immediately.\n</p>\n<p>7.\nNOTIFICATIONS\n</p>\n<p>7.1.\nFrom time to time we may send you notifications via e-mail (if you have given us\n</p>\n<p>your e-mail address) to inform you of updates and other important information.\n</p>\n<p>7.2.\nYou can unsubscribe from such e-mails at any time.\n</p>\n<p>8.\nPAID FEATURES AND NO FEE\n</p>\n<p>8.1.\nWe may in the future, at our sole discretion, introduce paid Avatar features or\n</p>\n<p>customization assets, such as, but not limited to virtual clothing, accessories and\n</p>\n<p>makeup for the use of which you must pay a fee for us (hereinafter: Paid\n</p>\n<p>Features).\n</p>\n<p>8.2.\nThe core Services, such as creation of Avatar are free of any fee payable by you to\n</p>\n<p>us and at the time we have no intention of changing it.\nHowever, we reserve the\n</p>\n<p>right to do so in the future as we are entitled to amend the Terms (see clause 10\n</p>\n<p>below).\nIn any case, the usage of the Avatar(s) already created by you shall be free\n</p>\n<p>of any fees payable by you to us indefinitely.\n</p>\n<p>9.\nGENERAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS\n</p>\n<p>9.1.\nYou are obligated to use the Services (and the Platform) only in accordance with\n</p>\n<p>the Terms, law and good practice.\n</p>\n<p>9.2.\nIf the Services provided by us are in breach of the Terms, you have the right to use\n</p>\n<p>legal remedies provided by the law: (a) require performance of the obligation.\n(b)\n</p>\n<p>withhold performance of an obligation

monetary obligation, demand\n</p>\n<p>payment of a penalty for late payment, unless otherwise provided by the Terms or\n</p>\n<p>by the applicable law.\n</p>\n<p>9.3.\nAny complaint against us can be filed by e-mail to support@wolf3d.io.\nSuch\n</p>\n<p>notification must include your name, contact information, date of submitting the\n</p>\n<p>notification, description of the complaint and the content of the offered solution of\n</p>\n<p>the complaint.\n</p>\n<p>9.4.\nYou undertake not to:\n</p>\n<p>a) use the Services for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms,\n</p>\n<p>law or good practice.\n</p>\n<p>b) use the Services for any immoral, abusive, harmful or nefarious purpose \u2013\n</p>\n<p>e.g.\nin a way that would cause damage to our software and/or hardware or in\n</p>\n<p>a way that would interfere with Services production to other users.\n</p>\n<p>c) not reverse engineer any of the Platform\u2019s software.\n</p>\n<p>d) use the Services in order to damage Wolf3D.\n</p>\n<p>e) take or use any photos of another person without his or her permission.\n</p>ReadyPlayerMe End-User Terms of Use 2021-01-19.pdfReadyPlayerMe End-User Terms of
