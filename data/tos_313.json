available to you from time to time for your use in connection with IMDb Services (\u201cIMDb Software\u201d).\nIf we provide specific Terms for the IMDb Software and there is a conflict between the specific Terms for the IMDb Software and these Conditions of Use, the specific Terms for the IMDb Software will govern.\n</p>Applicable Law <p>By using any IMDb Service, you agree that the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and IMDb.\n</p> Disputes <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any IMDb Service, or any products or services sold or distributed by IMDb or through the IMDb Services will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<b>a.</b> There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>b.</b> To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98051.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nThe AAA\u2019s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules.\nWe will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, IMDb will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>c.</b> You and IMDb each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration you and IMDb each waive any right to a jury trial.\nYou and IMDb also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.<br>\n</p> Site Policies, Modification, and Severability\n<p>Please review our other policies.\nThese policies also
