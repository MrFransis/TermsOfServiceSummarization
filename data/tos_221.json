ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\u2019t covered in this\nPrivacy Policy.</p> Sharing your information Personal information that you share <p>The Services are based on a community of users publicly sharing information with Waze and with other\nmembers of that community.</p>\n<p>In particular, users may choose to share personal information such as name, age, gender, picture,\ntheir location information, reports and other files.\nThis information may be shared either directly\nto the Services and to all users, such as in the case of traffic reports, or just to your friends on\nWaze.\nThis information may also be shared via third party services (such as social networks) which\ninteract with the Services upon such users\u2019 choice.\nFor more information about your Carpool profile\n(if you choose to set one), see section titled Waze Carpool Profile below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You can decide whether or not to upload content to the Services.\nHowever any content that you\nchoose to share and submit for posting is neither private nor confidential and you should expect\nthat it may be made public and known to others.</strong> Information you choose to upload will be posted\nalong with your user name and other information including personal information you attached to your\npublicly available user profile.\nFor example, your reports (map and road updates, traffic congestion\nupdates, road accidents, etc.) will be posted on the Waze map along with your username.\nYou should\nnote that certain road incidents you report may include your driving path within the vicinity of\nthose incidents.\nTherefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting information.\nAt the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal\ninformation by means other than the Internet and cellular services.</p>\n<p>In any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared from your social\nnetwork accounts according to your privacy settings for such social network accounts), your email\naddress will not be visible to others through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.</p>\n<p>if you choose to either record your own voice onto the Service, or to use the voice command\nfeatures, Waze will collect the voice information related to such use, including voice files.\nIf,\nafter recording your own voice, you chose to share your voice recordings, other Waze users and other\npeople will be able to download and use your voice recordings.\nOnce downloaded, Waze may not have\nany control over the voice files, so you should only share content that you are comfortable being\nmade public.</p>\n<p>We, at Waze, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you can have while using\nthe Services.\nHowever, Waze has no control over the conduct of any user and disclaims all liability\nin this regard.\nUsers are advised to carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public\nor available any information and carefully examine all necessary details related to any\ncommunication with other users prior to any engagement or communication being made.</p>\n<p>Participating in any user\u2019s activities as a result, directly or indirectly, from using Waze, is\nentirely at your own risk.\nWaze is not a party to any agreement entered into between the users in\nany circumstances.\nThe user has the sole and ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all\nlaws, regulations or any other duty.\nWe do not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or\nexpense that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with your participation in any\nactivity or event initiated, held or conducted by a user or a third party nor in connection to any\nagreement between the users or third parties, including any activity or event related in any way,\ndirectly or indirectly, the Services or the use thereof.</p> When Waze shares your information <p>Waze does not sell, rent or lease your personal information to third parties.</p>\n<p>Waze will not share your personal information with others, without your permission, except for the\nfollowing purposes and to the extent necessary in Waze\u2019s good-faith discretion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>As necessary for the facilitation and operation of the Services.\nFor example, making public road\nincidents you report and which are associated with your username and your location;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If Waze reasonably believes that you have breached the Terms of Use or is investigating potential\nbreach of the Terms of Use, or believes that you abused your rights to use the Services, or\nperformed any act or omission that Waze reasonably believes to be violating any applicable law,\nrules, or regulations.\nWaze may share your information in these cases, with law enforcement\nagencies and other competent authorities and with any third party as may be required to handle any\nresult of your wrongdoing;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If Waze is required, or reasonably believes that it is required by law to share or disclose your\ninformation;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In any case of dispute, or legal proceeding of any kind between you and Waze, or between you and\nother users with respect to, or in relation with the Services;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In any case where Waze reasonably believes that sharing information is necessary to protect\nagainst harm to the rights, property or safety of Waze, our users, or the public as required or\npermitted by law, including to prevent imminent physical damage or damage to property;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If Waze organizes the operation of the Services within a different framework, or through another\nlegal structure or entity, or if Waze is acquired by, or merged into or with another entity, or if\nWaze enters bankruptcy, provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by the provisions\nof this Privacy Policy, with respective changes taken into consideration;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To collect, store, hold and manage your personal information through cloud based or hosting\nservices or a third party or a party affiliated or connected to Waze, as reasonable for business\npurposes, which may be located in the European Union and the U.S.A., potentially countries outside\nof your jurisdiction;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Waze may also share personal information with companies or organizations connected or affiliated\nwith Waze, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies (i.e.\nentities that belong\nto the Google group of companies);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We work with other Google\u2019s services (such as Google Display and Video 360) for advertising and ad\nmeasurement purposes.\nIn order to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Waze, Google, and\nwebsites &amp.\napps that partner with Google, we may share information with these services, such as a\nunique identifier for advertising (i.e, Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices or\nsimilar technologies).\nYou can learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps\nthat use its services and how you can control that in\nthis page.\nFor more information see\nsection titled \u2018Advertising campaigns\u2019 under this Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also work with selected advertising and measurement services which help us understand how our\nusers interact with ads served in our platform and in order to provide marketing, advertising and\nmeasurement services for Waze with respect to Waze\u2019s own marketing efforts, by using and sharing\ndevices\u2019 identifiers (i.e, Advertising ID, cookies or similar technologies).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personal information may also be shared with Waze\u2019s trusted partners and service providers to\nprocess it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this policy and any other\nappropriate confidentiality and security measures.\nFor example, we use service providers to help\nus with customer services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may share information which does not personally identify you with third party transportation\nservices.\nFor example, to allow you to find a carpool rider on third party transportation services,\nsuch as Moovit, we may share a temporary unique identifier along with pick-up and drop-off points\nthat are generated based on proximity to your intended travel itinerary, with those third party\ntransportation services.\nYou can review the list of the relevant third party transportation services\nto your area and change your preferences at any time via the in-app settings.</p>\n<p>Waze Carpool partners with employers, organizations and governmental entities (\u201cWaze Carpool\nPartners\u201d) in order to encourage the use of carpooling.\nIf you have joined a Carpool group which is\npromoted by a partner or any other third party, your carpool profile (or other information you have\nchosen to share) may be visible to other members of the group, including representatives of the\npartner or third party who may also be part of the group.</p> Visibility <p>Please note that your username and some other information will be visible to others.\nNote that your\nusername will be included along with any information you submit for posting (such as traffic reports\nor chat messages).\nIt will therefore be visible to others.\nAlso - your friends on Waze will see your\nname &amp.\nprofile photo and any other information you chose to share with them.</p>\n<p>If you prefer to remain invisible on the Waze map, you can set the Waze Application not to show your\nlocation on the map.\nTo do so you should go to the Privacy Settings and adjust accordingly by\nswitching on to Invisible Mode.\nIf on, <strong>some features may not be available</strong>.\nIf you make this\nchoice, while you will be \u2018invisible\u2019 on the map to other users, your location and route information\nwill continue to be collected by Waze for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy and your\nCarpool profile (if you choose to set one) may be visible to other Waze\u2019s users.</p> Waze Carpool Profile <p>Waze Carpool is uniquely designed to help drivers and riders find a mutual ride that fits them.\nIf\nyou have opted-in to use the Waze Carpool feature, you will be required to create a unique profile.</p>\n<p>Your Waze Carpool profile includes your name, photo, number of completed rides and carpooled km, the\ndate you joined the services, information that you have chosen to share from your social account,\nyour carpool rating and endorsements you have received, and any other information you shared about\nyourself (for example your car details or any other information as part of \u201cMy Preferences\u201d\nsettings).\nYou can edit some of this information through the in-app settings or through your social\naccount (in case you have chosen to share the information from your social account).</p>\n<p>A complete Carpool profile is important so that riders or drivers can learn more about you, and vice\nversa.\nYour profile is therefore public to other Waze users and may be shared through our services.\nIf you have joined the Carpool Groups feature, your Carpool profile will be visible to other group\nmembers, including your co-workers or employer in case of work related groups.</p>\n<p>If you choose to verify your work or university\u2019s email address, your work or university will be\nlisted publicly on your profile as well (but your email address will stay private).</p>\n<p>Note: your home and work addresses are not listed publicly on your profile, but rather only be saved\non your Waze account.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, your pickup/drop-off spots may be your home\nor work address if for example you share a similar route with your driver or rider.</p> Integration with social networks <p>You may choose to share information between your Waze account and your social network account (such\nas Facebook).\nThrough this option, you may choose to have personal information and other content\nabout you available from social networks, transmitted and shared through the Services.\nSimilarly,\nyou may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from Waze,\nincluding your location and route information, transmitted to and shared through your social network\naccount.</p>\n<p>By setting your Waze Account to integrate with social networks, including by signing onto Waze by\nusing your social network account, you agree to share information (including personal information)\nbetween Waze and such social networks, for the purposes provided under this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>The social network\u2019s use of information made available by Waze is governed by that social network\u2019s\nprivacy policy and controlled by the social network, not by this Privacy Policy or Waze.</p>\n<p>When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the first time or otherwise\nmake the Services interact with your social network account, you will be asked by the social network\nto permit the social network to share your personal information stored on such social network with\nWaze.\nWe collect your information from your social network account only in accordance with the\npermissions granted by you (such as your name, email address, list of friends, profile picture and\nother information available via the applicable social network).</p>\n<p>You understand and agree that the Services may access, make available and store such information so\nthat it is available on and through your Waze Account, until your Waze Account is deleted.</p>\n<p>Please note that certain information which you have defined as private on your third party social\nnetwork accounts may become public to other Waze Users through the Services once you have allowed\nthe social network to share such information with Waze (for example through your Carpool Profile).</p> Integration with other third party services <p>Waze may offer you the option to link Waze to third party services that may be useful to you (like,\nSpotify).\nWhere Waze detects an integration may be available (either because a third party service\nattempts to link to Waze, or Waze detects an installed service on the device which has an\nintegration option, or you request a particular integration), Waze will ask for confirmation to\nconnect the accounts.\nIf you choose to connect the accounts, Waze will ask for your permission to\nshare data with the third party service.\nYou should only agree to connect accounts if you are\ncomfortable with the third party service receiving the data set out at the time of connecting the\naccounts and Waze is not responsible for the third party service\u2019s use of data.\nYou can disconnect\nWaze and the third party service at any time and Waze will cease sharing data with that service from\nthe point of disconnection onwards.</p> Controlling your personal information <p>You can always review and update certain information by visiting your Account &amp.\nLogin settings (such\nas your phone, name, photo and more) or the in-app left menu (to update your home, work and\nfavorites).\nIf you joined Waze Carpool, you can review and update your information (including this\navailable on your Waze Carpool profile) through the Waze Carpool in-app settings.</p>\n<p>You can log on to the Waze website to view your route history by going to \u201cEdit the Map\u201d/ \u201cDrives\u201d\nfunction on the Waze website.\nNote that in order to access certain information you will need to\nregister your Account.\nYour location and route history is associated with your Account.</p>\n<p>If you find that the information associated with your Account is not accurate, complete or updated,\nthen you should make all necessary changes to correct it.\nPlease keep in mind that false, incorrect,\nor outdated information may prevent you from setting up an Account and impair the ability to provide\nyou with Services.</p> Privacy controls <p>Your in-app Privacy Settings provide you with quick access to settings and tools that let you\nsafeguard your data and decide how your information can make Waze services work better for you.\nFor\nexample, you can control your visibility on the map and manage your preferences about the ads shown\nto you on Waze.\nIf you joined Waze Carpool, you can access more controls through your Carpool\nactivity and other in-app settings.</p>\n<p>There are other ways to control the information Waze collects whether or not you\u2019re signed in to a\nWaze Account, including device-level settings: your device may have controls that determine what\ninformation we collect.\nFor example, you can modify location settings on your device.</p> Deleting your information <p>If you would like us to delete your Account, please use the \u201cDelete Account\u201d function available\nunder the in-app Privacy Setting and on the Waze website.\nOn receiving such a request,\nWaze will use reasonable efforts to delete such information, however please note that information\nmay not be deleted immediately from our back-up systems.\nWe aim to initiate the deletion process\nimmediately after your request.\nOnce we receive your request, your data will no longer be used to\npersonalize your Waze experience.\nWe then begin a process designed to safely and completely delete\nthe data from our storage systems.\nThis process generally takes around 2 months from the time of\ndeletion.\nAs with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs,\nor failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and time frames defined in this\npolicy.\nWe maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.</p> How Waze retains data we collect <p>Some data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we\nretain for longer periods of time when necessary.\nThis section describes why we hold onto different\ntypes of data for different periods of time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Information retained until you remove it</strong> - such as your \u201cHome, \u201cwork\u201d, favorites, email\naddress and other account related information.\nWe\u2019ll keep this data in your Waze Account until you\nchoose to remove it and/or update it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data that expires after a specific period of time</strong> - in some cases, you don\u2019t need to actively\ndelete your information as we set retention timeframes based on the reason for the data\u2019s\ncollection.\nFor example, if you choose to connect your calendar to your Waze Account, we extract\nyour calendar events for several days in advance and delete them after their occurrence.\nWe may\nalso take steps to anonymize certain data within set timeperiods.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information retained until your Waze Account is deleted</strong> - we may keep some data for the life\nof your Waze Account if it\u2019s useful for helping us understand how users interact with our features\nand how we can improve our services.\nFor example, if you made an incident report, we will keep\ninformation about how many reports you have submitted, even after the event is removed.\nWhen you\ndelete your Waze Account, the information about how many reports you have submitted is also\nremoved.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information retained for extended time periods for limited purposes</strong> - sometimes business and\nlegal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended\nperiod of time.\nFor example, when Waze processes a payment for you, we\u2019ll retain this data for\nlonger periods of time as required for tax or accounting purposes.\nReasons we might retain some\ndata for extended periods of time include: <ul>\n<li>Security, fraud &amp.\nabuse prevention</li>\n<li>Financial record-keeping</li>\n<li>Complying with legal or regulatory requirements</li>\n<li>Ensuring the continuity of our services</li>\n<li>Direct communications with Waze</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> How does Waze use aggregated information? <p>Waze may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information (including anonymous location\ninformation), in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, to properly\noperate the Services, to improve the quality of the Services, to enhance your

(including advertising).</p>\n<p>Waze may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on the Services, in a\nform that does not enable the identification of a specific user, by posting, disseminating,\ntransmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to users of the\nServices, to the Services\u2019 providers, partners and any other third party.\nFor example, GPS\ninformation that we receive from your mobile device may be provided to map editors in an aggregated\nand/or anonymous form to help improve the map and solve map problems, traffic data may be provided\nto cities, aggregated use of Waze Carpool may be provided to Carpool Partners and aggregated ads\nanalysis may be provided to advertisers.</p> Cookies <p>Waze may use

that appear in your drive list)</li>\n<li>Information from our ad partners, including entities that belong to the Google group of companies\nand other trusted ad partners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can

ad for a nearby flower shop and select the\n\u201ctap to call\u201d button, we\u2019ll connect your call and share your phone number with the flower shop.</li>\n<li>As described under \u201cWhen Waze shares your information\u201d section above, we work with other Google\u2019s\nservices (such as Google Doubleclick Bid Manager) for advertising and ad measurement purposes.\nIn\norder to help advertisers decide what ads to show on Waze, Google, and websites &amp.\napps that\npartner with Google, Waze may share information with these services such as a unique identifier\nfor advertising (Advertising ID available on Android mobile devices or similar technologies).\nYou\ncan learn more about how Google uses information from sites or apps that use its services and how\nyou can control that in this page.</li>\n<li>The Ads personalization control described above apply to personalized ads served by Waze <strong>on the\nWaze platform</strong> and they do not apply to ads served on third parties platforms, including on\nWaze\u2019s behalf.</li>\n<li>When you visit a third party website from the Application, such third party may use cookies on\nyour computer.\nThe third party\u2019s use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not\nto this Privacy Policy.\nIf you wish to study the privacy policies of those third parties you\nshould visit their
