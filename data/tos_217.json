Archived versions | Download PDF</p>What\u2019s covered in these termsWe know it\u2019s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it\u2019s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.<p>These Terms of Service reflect the way Google\u2019s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we\u2019ve always believed to be true.\nAs a result, these Terms of Service help define Google\u2019s relationship with you as you interact with our services.\nFor example, these terms include the following topic headings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services</li>\n<li>What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services</li>\n<li>Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services \u2014 whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others</li>\n<li>In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms.</p>\n<p>Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy.\nAlthough it\u2019s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.</p>Service provider<p>In the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google services are provided by, and you\u2019re contracting with:</p>\n<p>Google Ireland Limited<br>incorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland (Registered Number: 368047)<br>\n<br>Gordon House, Barrow Street<br>Dublin 4<br>Ireland</p>Age requirements<p>If you\u2019re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian\u2019s permission to use a Google Account.\nPlease have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you\u2019re responsible for your child\u2019s activity on the services.</p>\n<p>Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.</p>ContentsIntroductionYour relationship with GoogleUsing Google servicesContent in Google servicesSoftware in Google servicesIn case of problems or disagreementsAbout these termsYour relationship with Google<p>These terms help define the relationship between you and Google.\nBroadly speaking, we give you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google\u2019s business works and how we earn money.\nWhen we speak of \u201cGoogle,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour,\u201d we mean Google Ireland Limited and its affiliates.</p>What you can expect from usProvide a broad range of useful servicesWe provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:<ul>\n<li>apps and sites (like Search and Maps)</li>\n<li>platforms (like Google Play)</li>\n<li>integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies\u2019 apps or sites)</li>\n<li>devices (like Google Home)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next.\nFor example, Maps can remind you to leave for an appointment that appears in your Google Calendar.</p>Improve Google services<p>We\u2019re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services.\nFor example, we invest in artificial intelligence that uses machine learning to detect and block spam and malware, and to provide you with innovative features, like simultaneous translations.\nAs part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones.</p>\n<p>We maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others.\nWe only change or stop offering services for valid reasons, such as to improve performance or security, to comply with law, to prevent illegal activities or abuse, to reflect technical developments, or because a feature or an entire service is no longer popular enough or economical to offer.</p>\n<p>If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.</p>What we expect from youFollow these terms and service-specific additional termsThe permission we give you to use our services continues as long as you meet your responsibilities in: <ul>\n<li>\n<b>these terms</b>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>service-specific additional terms</b>, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services.\nThese resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site.</p>\n<p>Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.</p>Respect othersMany of our services allow you to interact with others.\nWe want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:<ul>\n<li>comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws</li>\n<li>respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights</li>\n<li>don\u2019t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) \u2014 for example, by misleading, defrauding, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others</li>\n<li>don\u2019t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our service-specific additional terms and policies provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow.\nIf you find that others aren\u2019t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse.\nIf we act on a report of abuse, we also provide a fair process as described in the <em>Taking action in case of problems</em> section.</p>Permission to use your content<p>Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content.\nYou have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you\u2019re free to choose the content that you want to provide.\nIf you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.</p>License<p>Your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content.\nFor example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write.\nOr you may have the right to share someone else\u2019s creative content if they\u2019ve given you their permission.</p>\n<p>We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content.\nYou provide Google with that permission through this license.</p>What\u2019s covered<p>This license covers your content if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.</p>What\u2019s not covered<ul>\n<li>This license doesn\u2019t affect your data protection rights \u2014 it\u2019s only about your intellectual property rights</li>\n<li>This license doesn\u2019t cover these types of content:<ul>\n<li>publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business.\nThat information doesn\u2019t require a license because it\u2019s considered common knowledge that everyone\u2019s free to use.</li>\n<li>feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services.\nFeedback is covered in the <em>Service-related communications</em> section below.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>ScopeThis license is:<ul>\n<li>worldwide, which means it\u2019s valid anywhere in the world</li>\n<li>non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others</li>\n<li>royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license</li>\n</ul>Rights<p>This license allows Google to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content \u2014 for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go</li>\n<li>publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you\u2019ve made it visible to others</li>\n<li>modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it</li>\n<li>sublicense these rights to:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose</li>\n<li>our contractors who\u2019ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the <em>Purpose</em> section below</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>Purpose<p>This license is for the limited purpose of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>operating and improving the services</b>, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities.\nThis includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:<ul>\n<li>for spam, malware, and illegal content</li>\n<li>to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together</li>\n<li>to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in Ads Settings)</li>\n</ul>This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.</li>\n<li>\n<b>using content you\u2019ve shared publicly to promote the services</b>.\nFor example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote.\nOr to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.</li>\n<li>\n<b>developing new technologies and services</b> for Google consistent with these terms</li>\n</ul>Duration<p>This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>If you remove from our services any content that\u2019s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time.\nThere are two exceptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you already shared your content with others before removing it.\nFor example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend\u2019s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.</li>\n<li>If you make your content available through other companies\u2019 services, it\u2019s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.</li>\n</ul>Using Google servicesYour Google Account<p>If you meet these age requirements you can create a Google Account for your convenience.\nSome services require that you have a Google Account in order to work \u2014 for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the Security Checkup.</p>Using Google services on behalf of an organization or businessMany organizations, such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our services.\nTo use our services on behalf of an organization:<ul>\n<li>an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms</li>\n<li>your organization\u2019s administrator may assign a Google Account to you.\nThat administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.</li>\n</ul>If you\u2019re based in the European Union, then these terms don\u2019t affect the rights you may have as a business user of online intermediation services \u2014 including online platforms such as Google Play \u2014 under the EU Platform-to-Business Regulation.Service-related communications<p>To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information.\nTo learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.</p>Content in Google servicesYour content<p>Some of our services give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available \u2014 for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See the <em>Permission to use your content</em> section for more about your rights in your content, and how your content is used in our services</li>\n<li>See the <em>Removing your content</em> section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think someone is infringing your intellectual property rights, you can send us notice of the infringement and we\u2019ll take appropriate action.\nFor example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat copyright infringers as described in our Copyright Help Center.</p>Google content<p>Some of our services include content that belongs to Google \u2014 for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps.\nYou may use Google\u2019s content as allowed by these terms and any service-specific additional terms, but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content.\nDon\u2019t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices.\nIf you want to use our branding or logos, please see the Google Brand Permissions page.</p>Other content<p>Finally, some of our services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations \u2014 for example, a store owner\u2019s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News.\nYou may not use this content without that person or organization\u2019s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law.\nThe views expressed in other people or organizations\u2019 content are theirs, and don\u2019t necessarily reflect Google\u2019s views.</p>Software in Google services<p>Some of our services include downloadable software.\nWe give you permission to use that software as part of the services.</p>The license we give you is:<ul>\n<li>worldwide, which means it\u2019s valid anywhere in the world</li>\n<li>non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others</li>\n<li>royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license</li>\n<li>personal, which means it doesn\u2019t extend to anyone else</li>\n<li>non-assignable, which means you\u2019re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of our services include software that\u2019s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you.\nSometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.</p>\n<p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.\nAlso, you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract any of our source code unless you have our written permission or applicable law lets you do so.</p>\n<p>When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available.\nSome services let you adjust your automatic update settings.</p>In case of problems or disagreements<p>By law, you have the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong.\nThese terms don\u2019t limit or take away any of those rights.\nFor example, if you\u2019re a consumer, then you continue to enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law.</p>Warranty<p>We provide our services using reasonable skill and care.\nIf we don\u2019t meet the quality level described in this warranty, you agree to tell us and we\u2019ll work with you to try to resolve the issue.</p>Disclaimers<p>The only commitments we make about our services (including the content in the services, the specific functions of our services, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs) are (1) described in the <em>Warranty</em> section, (2) stated in the service-specific additional terms, or (3) provided under applicable laws.\nWe don\u2019t make any other commitments about our services.</p>LiabilitiesFor all users<p>These terms only limit our responsibilities as allowed by applicable law.\nSpecifically, these terms don\u2019t limit Google\u2019s liability for death or personal injury, fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, gross negligence, or willful misconduct.</p>\n<p>Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this section (<em>In case of problems or disagreements</em>), Google won\u2019t be responsible for any other losses, unless they\u2019re caused by our breach of these terms or service-specific additional terms.</p>For business users and organizations only<p>If you\u2019re a business user or organization, then to the extent allowed by applicable law:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You\u2019ll indemnify Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the services or violation of these terms or service-specific additional terms.\nThis indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees.</li>\n<li>Google won\u2019t be responsible for the following liabilities:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings</li>\n<li>indirect or consequential loss</li>\n<li>punitive damages</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Google\u2019s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) \u20ac500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including indemnification, then those responsibilities don\u2019t apply to you under these terms.\nFor example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don\u2019t override those immunities.</p>Taking action in case of problems<p>Before taking action as described below, we\u2019ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to fix the problem, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>cause harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google</li>\n<li>violate the law or a legal enforcement authority\u2019s order</li>\n<li>compromise an investigation</li>\n<li>compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our services</li>\n</ul>Removing your content<p>If we reasonably believe that any of your content (1) breaches these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies, (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law.\nExamples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, and content that infringes someone else\u2019s intellectual property rights.</p>Suspending or terminating your access to Google services<p>Google reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, service-specific additional terms or policies</li>\n<li>we\u2019re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order</li>\n<li>we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or liability to a user, third party, or Google \u2014 for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn\u2019t belong to you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.</p>\n<p>Of course, you\u2019re always free to stop using our services at any time.\nIf you do stop using a service, we\u2019d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.</p>Handling requests for your data<p>Respect for the privacy and security of your data underpins our approach to responding to data disclosure requests.\nWhen we receive data disclosure requests, our team reviews them to make sure they satisfy legal requirements and Google\u2019s data disclosure policies.\nGoogle Ireland Limited accesses and discloses data, including communications, in accordance with the laws of Ireland, and EU law applicable in Ireland.\nFor more information about the data disclosure requests that Google receives worldwide, and how we respond to such requests, see our Transparency Report and Privacy Policy.</p>Settling disputes, governing law, and courts<p>For information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a resident of, or an organization based in, the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, these terms and your relationship with Google under these terms and service-specific additional terms, are governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you can file legal disputes in your local courts.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a consumer living in the EEA, you may also file disputes regarding online purchases using the European Commission\u2019s Online Dispute Resolution platform, which we accept if required by law.</p>About these terms<p>By law, you have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract like these terms of service.\nThese terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.</p>\n<p>These terms describe the relationship between you and Google.\nThey don\u2019t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.</p>\n<p>We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we\u2019ve used examples from our services.\nBut not all services mentioned may be available in your country.</p>\n<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.</p>\n<p>We may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business \u2014 for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.</p>\n<p>If we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements.\nIf you don\u2019t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services.\nYou can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.</p>Definitionsaffiliate<p>An entity that belongs to the Google group of companies, which means Google LLC and its subsidiaries, including the following companies that

informationRetaining your informationCompliance &amp.\ncooperation with regulatorsAbout this policyRelated privacy practices<p>We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways.\nOur services include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home</li>\n<li>Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system</li>\n<li>Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy.\nFor example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results.\nAnd you can use many Google services when you\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos.\nYou can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode.\nAnd across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.</p>\n<p>To help explain things as clearly as possible, we\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms.\nAnd if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.</p>Information Google collects<p>We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</p>\n<p>We collect information to provide better services to all our users \u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.\nThe information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\u2019re using.\nThis helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.</p>Things you create or provide to us<p>When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password.\nYou can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account.\nEven if you aren\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \u2014 like an email address to receive updates about our services.</p>\n<p>We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services.\nThis includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.</p>Information we collect as you use our servicesYour apps, browsers &amp.\ndevices<p>We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.</p>\n<p>The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number.\nWe also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.</p>\n<p>We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates.\nIf you\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services.\nThis information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.</p>Your activity<p>We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like.\nThe activity information we collect may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terms you search for</li>\n<li>Videos you watch</li>\n<li>Views and interactions with content and ads</li>\n<li>Voice and audio information when you use audio features</li>\n<li>Purchase activity</li>\n<li>People with whom you communicate or share content</li>\n<li>Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services</li>\n<li>Chrome browsing history you\u2019ve synced with your Google Account</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls.</p>\n<p>You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\u2019s saved in your account.</p>\n<p>Go to Google Account</p>Your location information<p>We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you.</p>\n<p>Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GPS</li>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>Sensor data from your device</li>\n<li>Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings.\nFor example, you can turn your Android device\u2019s location on or off using the device\u2019s settings app.\nYou can also turn on Location History if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources.\nFor example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name.\nWe may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse.\nWe also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.</p>\n<p>We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.</p>Why Google collects data<p>We use data to build better services</p>\n<p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>Provide our services<p>We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p>Maintain &amp.\nimprove our services<p>We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us.\nAnd we use your information to make improvements to our services \u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</p>Develop new services<p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones.\nFor example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p>Provide personalized services, including content and ads<p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.\nFor example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products.\nAnd Google Play uses information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p>\n<p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests.\nFor example, if you search for \u201cmountain bikes,\u201d you may see an ad for sports equipment when you\u2019re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google.\nYou can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to.\nFor example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \u201ctap to call\u201d button, we\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Go to Ad Settings</p>Measure performance<p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used.\nFor example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design.\nAnd we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns.\nWe use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.\nWhen you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>Communicate with you<p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly.\nFor example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location.\nOr we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services.\nAnd if you contact Google, we\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p>Protect Google, our users, and the public<p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services.\nThis includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>\n<p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes.\nWe use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services.\nAnd we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content.\nWe also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data.\nFor example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.</p>\n<p>We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above.\nFor example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.\nDepending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>\n<p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo.\nThis helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>Your privacy controls<p>You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used</p>\n<p>This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services.\nYou can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings.\nIn addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.</p>\n<p>Go to Privacy Checkup</p>Managing, reviewing, and updating your information<p>When you\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use.\nFor example, Photos and Drive are both designed to help you manage specific types of content you\u2019ve saved with Google.</p>\n<p>We also built a place for you to review and control information saved in your Google Account.\nYour Google Account includes:</p>Privacy controlsActivity Controls<p>Decide what types of activity you\u2019d like saved in your account.\nFor

settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser.\nYou can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains.\nBut remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.</li>\n<li>Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect.\nFor example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.</li>\n</ul>Sharing your informationWhen you share your information<p>Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share.\nFor example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private.\nRemember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity.\nWe may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.</p>When Google shares your information<p>We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:</p>With your consent<p>We\u2019ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent.\nFor example, if you use Google Home to make a reservation through a booking service, we\u2019ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant.\nWe\u2019ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.</p>With domain administrators<p>If you\u2019re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services, your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account.\nThey may be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email</li>\n<li>View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you

confidentiality and security measures.\nFor example, we use service providers to help us with customer support.</p>For legal reasons<p>We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.\nWe share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.</li>\n<li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including

our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners \u2014 like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders.\nFor example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.\nWe also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.</p>\n<p>If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we\u2019ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>Keeping your information secure<p>We build security into our services to protect your information</p>\n<p>All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information.\nThe insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you.\nAnd if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we\u2019ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.</p>\n<p>We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit</li>\n<li>We offer a range of security features, like Safe

longer periods of time when necessary for legitimate business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form.\nWe try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion.\nBecause of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.</p>\n<p>You can read more about Google\u2019s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.</p>Compliance &amp.\ncooperation with regulators<p>We regularly review this Privacy Policy and

resolve with you directly.</p>European requirements<p>If European Union (EU) or United Kingdom (UK) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the controls described

complying with applicable privacy laws.</p>\n<p>We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:</p>With your consent<p>We ask for your agreement to process your information for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\nFor example, we ask for your consent to provide you with personalized

identifiable information<p>This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.</p>Personal information<p>This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.</p>Pixel tag<p>A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened.\nPixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.</p>Referrer URL<p>A Referrer URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is information transmitted to a destination webpage by a web browser, typically when you click a link to that page.\nThe Referrer URL contains the URL of the last webpage the browser visited.</p>Sensitive personal information<p>This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.</p>Server logs<p>Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites.\nThese \u201cserver logs\u201d typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>\n<p>A typical log entry for a search for \u201ccars\u201d looks like this:</p>123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -<br>http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -<br>Firefox 1.0.7.\nWindows NT 5.1

be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.</li>\n<li>\n<code>25/Mar/2003 10:15:32</code> is the date and time of the query.</li>\n<li>\n<code>http://www.google.com/search?q=cars</code> is the requested URL, including the search query.</li>\n<li>\n<code>Firefox 1.0.7.\nWindows NT 5.1</code> is the browser and operating system being used.</li>\n<li>\n<code>740674ce2123a969</code> is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google.\n(Cookies can be deleted by users.\nIf the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they\u2019ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).</li>\n</ul>Unique identifiers<p>A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device.\nDifferent identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.</p>\n<p>Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising.\nFor example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language.\nYou can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nLearn more about how Google uses cookies.</p>\n<p>On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device.\nFor example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device\u2019s settings.\nUnique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone.\nFor example, a device\u2019s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.</p>Additional Contextads you\u2019ll find most useful<p>For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web.\nWe also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for \u201cpizza.\u201d Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.</p>advertising and research services on their behalf<p>For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns.\nWe only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don\u2019t reveal information about individual people.</p>Android device with Google apps<p>Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions.\nThese devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone\u2019s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.</p>appropriate safeguards<p>For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can\u2019t be linked to other information about you.\nLearn more</p>combine the information we

public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar.\nThis can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos.\nLearn more</li>\n<li>If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name.\nThis feature makes it easier to share things with people you know.\nLearn more</li>\n<li>The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings.\nFor example, if you have searches stored in your Web &amp.\nApp Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity.\nLearn more</li>\n<li>If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant.\nFor example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone.\nLearn more</li>\n</ul>customized search results<p>For example, when you\u2019re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web &amp.\nApp Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services.\nYou can learn more here.\nYou may also get customized search results even when you\u2019re signed out.\nIf you don\u2019t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.</p>Customizing our services<p>For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.</p>deliver our services<p>Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a

you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, animations, and other creations that you can share.\nLearn more</li>\n<li>A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a \u201ccheck-in\u201d button that appears in your Gmail</li>\n<li>When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions.\nWe use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.</li>\n</ul>detect abuse<p>When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action.\nIn certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.</p>devices<p>For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you\u2019d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play.\nWe also use this information to help protect your account.</p>ensure and improve<p>For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.</p>ensure our services are working as intended<p>For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems.\nAnd if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.</p>Information about things near your device<p>If you use Google\u2019s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps.\nIf you use Google\u2019s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength).\nAll these things help to determine your location.\nYou can use your device settings to enable Google Location services.\nLearn more</p>legal process, or enforceable governmental request<p>Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data.\nRespect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests.\nOur legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn\u2019t follow the correct process.\nLearn more in our Transparency Report.</p>make improvements<p>For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services.\nAnd that analysis can help us build better products.\nFor example, it may help us discover that it\u2019s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all.\nWe can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.</p>may link information<p>Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer.\nUsing our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites.\nFor example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.\nLearn more</p>partner with Google<p>There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.\nLearn more</p>payment information<p>For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store.\nWe may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment.\nIn some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.</p>\n<p>We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you\u2019re not old enough to have a Google Account.\nLearn more</p>personalized ads<p>You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser.\nIf you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads.\nLearn more</p>phone number<p>If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings.\nFor example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you.\nLearn more</p>protect against abuse<p>For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).</p>publicly accessible sources<p>For example, we may collect information that\u2019s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google\u2019s language models and build features like Google Translate.</p>rely on cookies to function properly<p>For example, we use a cookie called \u2018lbcs\u2019 that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser.\nBlocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected.\nLearn more</p>safety and reliability<p>Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse.\nThis abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.</li>\n<li>The \u201clast account activity\u201d feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge.\nThis feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access.\nLearn more</li>\n</ul>sensitive categories<p>When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity.\nFor example, you may see ads for things like \"Cooking and Recipes\" or \"Air Travel.\u201d We don\u2019t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\nAnd we require the same from advertisers that use our services.</p>Sensor data from your device<p>Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement.\nFor example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.</p>servers around the world<p>For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.</p>services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages<p>Examples of these services include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Hangouts, for making domestic and international calls</li>\n<li>Google Voice, for making calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail</li>\n<li>Google Fi, for a phone plan</li>\n</ul>show trends<p>When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time.\nGoogle Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms.\nLearn more</p>specific Google services<p>For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites.\nYou can also delete reviews you\u2019ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.</p>specific partners<p>For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies.\nAnother example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings.\nLearn more about these partners and how they use your information.</p>synced with your Google Account<p>Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you\u2019ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account.\nLearn more</p>the people who matter most to you online<p>For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently.</p>third parties<p>For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services.\nWe may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.</p>Views and interactions with content and ads<p>For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer.\nWe may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.</p>your activity on other sites and apps<p>This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google.\nMany websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services.\nFor example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube).\nThese services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.</p>\n<p>Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.</p>", "created_at": "2018-08-24 10:45:38.996772", "updated_at":
