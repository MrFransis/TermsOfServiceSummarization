information that we have from you if you have only visited our Sites.\nHowever, visitors to our Sites can reference the chart above for details about the personal information we collect, the reasons why we collect it, and the categories of third parties with which we share the information.\nIn addition, if you are a current customer, we are unable to process requests to delete your personal information.\nbecause we collect only the information we need to provide our service, we necessarily need to continue to use your information to serve you.</p>\n<p>Each year we will disclose in this Privacy Notice an average number of requests from the prior calendar year.\nThis will include the number of requests, as described above, and the median number of days to respond to requests for the prior twelve-month period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consumers may submit requests through authorized agents.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may authorize a third party to submit a request on your behalf as your authorized agent.\nYour authorized agent can submit a request using the same form provided above.\nWe will validate your identity using the same process described in this Privacy Notice, and will only

unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose information.</p> California privacy rights, which we meet for all of our customers, are reflected in this Privacy Notice <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act grants several privacy rights to residents of California, and we believe these same rights should apply to any consumer, in any state.\nThese rights are reflected in this Privacy Notice and we apply them uniformly to all consumers.</p> We may change this Privacy Notice from time to time <p>You will find the most current version of this Privacy Notice at www.starry.com/legal.\nWe may make changes to this Privacy Notice at any time.\nThe text of this Privacy Notice was updated on January 2, 2020, to improve the clarity of our description of the circumstances in which we share information with third parties and to comply in part with the California Consumer Privacy Act.\nIf we make any changes we believe are material, we will provide you notice at least 30 days in advance.\nIn most cases, if you continue to use the Service, visit the Sites, or use the Apps after we have posted or otherwise notified you of changes to this Privacy Notice, that will indicate your acceptance of those changes.\nHowever, we will obtain your affirmative consent if we make material changes to the way in which we use information that personally identifies you and that was collected from your use of our Service, before such change is made.</p> Download a copy of our Privacy Policy here\n<p>Download PDF</p> ", "created_at": "2021-06-09 20:50:56.995197", "updated_at": "2021-06-09
