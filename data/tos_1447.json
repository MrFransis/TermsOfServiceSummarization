content in your private notebooks, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures, or for known active malware.</p>\n3.\nHow We Share the Information We Collect\n<p>We do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf.\nFor example, if you suggest a notebook to another Observable User, we will send them an email including your name and Observable login, and a link to your suggested notebook.\nIf you join a Team Account, the other members of the team will be able to view and edit any team

uses cookies (and similar technologies, such as HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Observable.\nThe cookies

or device.\nIf you disable your browser or device\u2019s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use the Service.</p>\n<p>Certain pages on our site may set other third party

party cookies, we can\u2019t always control what cookies this third party content sets.</p>\n6.\nTracking and analytics\n<p>We use a number of third party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our users\u2019 use of Observable, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and website performance.\nIn addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our service and performance.</p>\n<p>We do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track our users\u2019 activity over time on Observable.\nWe do not track your online browsing activity on other online services.</p>\nE.\nUser-Generated Content\n<p>\n<strong>Short version:</strong>\n<em>You own the content you create, but you allow us certain rights, so that we can display and share the content you post.\nYou still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service.\nWe have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.</em>\n</p>\n1.\nResponsibility for User-Generated Content\n<p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service.\nYou are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you or Team Users post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content.\nWe are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>\n2.\nObservable May Remove Content\n<p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Observable terms or policies.</p>\n3.\nOwnership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants\n<p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content.\nIf you\u2019re posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you and your Team Users are responsible for any Content you post.\nthat you will only submit Content that you have the right to post.\nand that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.</p>\n<p>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us \u2014 and other Observable Users \u2014 certain legal permissions, listed in Sections E.4 \u2014 E.6.\nThese license grants apply to Your Content.\nIf you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Observable the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required.\nYou understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections E.4 \u2014 E.6.\nThe licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.</p>\n4.\nLicense Grant to Us\n<p>We need the legal

into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers.\nshare it with other users you choose to share it with.\nrun it in a notebook environment.\nand perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.\nWe need these rights for both public and private notebooks because these rights are necessary for providing the Service.</p>\n<p>This license does not grant Observable the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.</p>\n5.\nLicense Grant to Other Users\n<p>Any User-Generated Content you or your Team Users post publicly may be viewed by others.\nBy publishing your notebooks, you agree to allow others to view, \u201cimport\u201d and \u201cfork\u201d your notebooks.\nThis means that others may load your published Content into notebooks they control, or make their own copies of your published Content in notebooks they control.</p>\n<p>When you publish a notebook, you grant each User of Observable a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Observable Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Observable as permitted through Observable\u2019s functionality (for example, through forking).\nIf you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Observable Users.</p>\n6.\nContributions Under a Notebook License\n<p>Whenever you make a suggestion to a notebook containing notice of a license, you license your suggestion under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your suggestion under those terms.\nIf you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.\nThis style of collaboration is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community, where it\u2019s commonly referred to by the shorthand \u201cinbound=outbound\u201d.</p>\n7.\nMoral Rights\n<p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution.\nHowever, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section E.4, but not otherwise.</p>\n<p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Observable the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>\nF.\nPrivate Notebooks\n<p>\n<strong>Short version:</strong>\n<em>You may have access to private

Content.</p>\n2.\nConfidentiality of Private Notebooks.\n<p>Observable considers the contents of private notebooks to be confidential to you or your team.\nObservable will protect the contents of

to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of Observable\u2019s systems and Service.</li>\n<li>When access is required for analytics reasons, to learn how Observable users are making use of the Service.</li>\n</ul>\n4.\nExclusions.\n<p>If we have reason to believe the contents of a private notebook are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose User Personal Information or the contents of your private notebooks in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.</p>\n<p>In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, we strive for transparency.\nWhen permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their
