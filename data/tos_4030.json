any warranties, express or implied.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Kialo disclaims all warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</i>\n</p>\n<p>(Some states don\u2019t allow these disclaimers, so this provision might not apply to you.)</p> Limitation of Liability <p>\n<i>To the fullest extent allowed by law, Kialo shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, any loss of profits or revenues, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from (A) your access to, use of, inability to access, or inability to use Kialo.\n(B) any third-party conduct or content on Kialo, including any defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of third parties.\nor (C) any unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your content.</i>\n</p>\n<p>(Some states don\u2019t allow these limitations, so this provision might not apply to you.)</p> Arbitration and Opt Out <p>We\u2019d like to resolve any disputes fairly and quickly.\nToward that end, if you have any issue with Kialo, please contact us and we\u2019ll work with you in good faith to try to resolve the matter.</p>\n<p>If we can\u2019t resolve the dispute informally, you and Kialo agree to resolve any claim against each other through final and binding arbitration.</p>\n<p>We agree to submit the dispute to a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, or, by separate mutual agreement, to another arbitration institution.\nThe AAA\u2019s rules and a description of the arbitration process are available at www.adr.org.</p>\n<p>The location of the arbitration and the allocation of fees and costs shall be determined under the AAA rules, except that Kialo will reimburse you for all AAA administrative fees in disputes that are subject to the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.</p>\n<p>The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Kialo will pay for all reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees, as long as the arbitrator determines that your claim is non-frivolous.\nIf you win an arbitration award that\u2019s more generous than any offer we made to settle the dispute, Kialo will pay you $1,500 on top of the award.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs all disputes between you and Kialo.\nThe arbitrator will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated.</p>\n<p>If you opt out of the arbitration agreement (as provided below), or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, you agree to resolve any claim you have with Kialo exclusively in a state or federal court located in Delaware, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Delaware for purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>\n<p>Nothing shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the services.</p>\n<i>Your Right to Opt Out of Arbitration</i>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate.\nIf you do so, neither you nor Kialo can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.\nTo opt out, you must notify Kialo within 90 days of the date that you first agreed to these Terms.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Your written opt-out notice must include (1) your name and residence address.\n(2) the email address associated with your account.\n(3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.\nand (4) your signature.</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>To opt out of arbitration, please send an email to optout@kialo.com.</i>\n</b>\n</p> Governing Law and Jurisdiction <p>These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, except for its conflict of laws principles.</p>\n<p>For claims that aren\u2019t subject to arbitration, we each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Delaware or in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.</p> Entire Agreement and Severability <p>The Terms, and the other materials incorporated by reference, constitute the full and entire agreement between you and Kialo.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p> No Waiver <p>No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be a further or continuing waiver of that term.\nKialo\u2019s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p> Modification <p>The Terms may be modified from time to time.\nThe date of the most recent revisions will always be at https://www.kialo.com/terms, and older versions will be archived at https://www.kialo.com/terms/archive.\nIf we make changes that we believe will substantially alter your rights, we will notify you in advance.\nYou\u2019ll agree to accept any changes or revisions to the Terms by continuing to use Kialo.</p> Contact <p>We welcome all questions, concerns, and feedback you might have about these
