you are not 18 years of age.\nWe will remove accounts of users that are found to be younger than 18.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>Basic Guidelines for Posting<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engage with one another in good faith</li>\n<li>Respect boundaries as placed by others</li>\n<li>Be respectful/apologize/give space as necessary if someone tells you, or implies through their actions, that you

apply to freelance artists)</li>\n<li>Posts that do not tag potentially upsetting content behind the CW feature, including pornographic or other NSFW material, politics, violence/assault, suicide, etc.</li>\n<li>\"Screenshot dunking,\" in which a user posts a screenshot of another post solely to criticize it</li>\n<li>Bot accounts (please use botsin.space for bot accounts!)</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\nIn addition to the tagged content above, we also ask those using a twitter crossposter to tag anything automatically posted with a \"from twitter\" CW or something similar.\nHowever, excessive use of this feature is not advised and we recommend the use of \"reverse-crossposting\" from Mastodon to fully utilize the CW feature.\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>The following types of content will be removed from the public timeline, and will result in account suspension and revocation of access to this server:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Racism or advocation of racism (e.g.\nusing racist pejoratives, advocating white supremacy, etc.)</li>\n<li>Sexism or advocation of sexism (e.g.\nusing sexist pejoratives, mansplaining, etc.)</li>\n<li>Discrimination against gender, romantic, and sexual minorities (e.g.\nusing homophobic/transphobic/queerphobic pejoratives, invalidating others, intentionally ignoring or misusing another's pronouns, etc.)</li>\n<li>Ableism or advocation of

from a non-admin/moderator.\nUsers are welcome to educate others, but expecting it from others at all times is an unfair form of emotional labor that places the onus on the marginalized to engage at all times</li>\n<li>Presenting bad-faith arguments and otherwise concern-trolling</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>This is not an exhaustive list.\nIf any of these don't make sense or you would like a deeper
