communicate with us includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Registration and profile information.</b> When you register or subscribe to any of the Services, you provide us with information such as your first name, last name, recovery email, username and password.\nYou may optionally provide us, all in accordance with applicable laws, the email addresses in your mobile address book on a regular basis.\nYou may also add other information to your account, such as a profile picture.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Email data.</b> When you use our Services to send an email, we process your email address, recipient\u2019s email address, subject and the encrypted content of your messages (including body and attachments).\nOnce messages are delivered to your device, they are deleted from our servers.\nThe same holds true for messages which you send.\nYour messages are permanently stored on your own device and not on our servers.\nIf a message cannot be delivered immediately (for example, if you are offline or the device is powered off), we may keep it on our servers for up to 30 days.\nAfter the 30-day period the message is deleted from our server.\nWe also keep email metadata (subject, date and sender email address) in order to enable certain features of the Services, such as the \u201cunsend\u201d, \u201cread receipts\u201d and \u201cexpiration\u201d features.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Feedback and correspondence

email is sent to you by a non-Criptext sender, the email gets encrypted by the server with your public key and can only be decrypted by your device.\nThe same holds true for attachments that are sent to you from non-Criptext addresses.\nThis means that your emails are always encrypted, even if the sender is not using Criptext.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Device And Connection Information.</b> We may automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our Services.\nThis includes information like hardware model, operating system information, battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, and mobile network, connection information including mobile operator or ISP, language and time zone, and IP.\nThis is to help us identify bugs and deliver better help to users who contacts us with support questions.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Cookies.</b> We use cookies only in our Website.\nWe may also use cookies to understand which of our FAQs are most popular and to show you relevant content related to our Services.\nAdditionally, we may use cookies to remember your choices, like your language preferences, to provide a safer experience, and
