and other technologies to help recognize you as a repeat visitor and, to improve the quality of our Services.</p>How we use cookies<p>When you visit Dare Drop, our web server sends a cookie to your device, which allows us to recognize your device (but not the specific person using it).\nBy associating the identification numbers in the cookies with other account information when, for example, you log in to our Services, we know that the cookie information relates to your user account.\nSimilarly, pixel tags on Dare Drop and in email communications help us identify how your device is being used to interact with Dare Drop content.\nSome of the tags and cookies used by our Services are served by us, and some are served by trusted partners who are delivering services on our behalf.</p>\n<p>Some examples of the types of cookies and other technologies Dare Drop uses:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Authentication</strong>Dare Drop uses authentication cookies and similar technologies to tell us when you\u2019re logged in to Dare Drop.\nThis lets us show you personalized views related to your interests and connect you with Dares like those you may already have backed.<strong>Security</strong>Cookies also help keep Dare Drop secure by facilitating security features and allowing us to detect activity that might violate our rules and Terms of Service.\nThese cookies help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you, alert you and us when your account is accessed, and provide capabilities that allow us to disable any active sessions you have (for example, when you log out or change your password).<strong>Localization</strong>Some cookies help us provide localized experiences \u2014 for example, by making sure you see Dare Drop in your preferred language.<strong>Site features and services</strong>Dare Drop uses cookies that provide functionality and help us deliver our products and services \u2014 for instance, by storing your preferences or by pre-filling the username field when you log in.<strong>Performance</strong>Performance cookies help us route traffic between servers and understand how Dare Drop is performing, so we can provide you with the best experience possible.\nWe may use third party software development kits (SDK) in our mobile apps to collect information about activity in the app, the type of device and operating system it is running on and how the app is functioning.\nFor example an SDK may send us a report if the app crashes, and reports on which features of the app are used more than others.<strong>Analytics and research</strong>Cookies and other technologies also help us to understand, improve, and research features and content on the Dare Drop site.\nFor example, we may use cookies to understand how you are discovering Dares or to determine which types of browsers or devices are accessing Dare Drop.\nYou can opt-out of being included in Google Analytics here.<strong>Social Media Platforms</strong>Cookies and other technologies make interacting with social media platforms more seamless.\nFor example, when you\u2019re signed into social media accounts while you use our Services, these technologies enable you to share content with your social network or, in some cases, log in using your social media credentials.\nThese features are usually controlled by the social media platform you are using and are governed by its separate privacy policies and the preferences you set with that service.<strong>Marketing</strong>Cookies help us deliver targeted advertisements on social media platforms, based on your activity on Dare Drop, including the Dares you\u2019ve backed or creators you\u2019ve followed on Dare Drop, and to track the performance of those ads.\nThis is sometimes referred to as online behavioral advertising.\nIn some cases, our partners may use cookies to provide us with information about your interactions with their services.\nThose third-party cookies would be subject to the third party service\u2019s policies.\nYou can opt-out of online behavioral advertising.\nThe Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides consumers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes.\nTo opt out of having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes, click here.\nCertain choices you make are both browser- and device-specific.</p>You can control certain cookies<p>Your browser may give you the ability to control

Policy describes the information we collect from you, how we use that information and our legal basis for doing so.\nIt also covers whether and how that information may be shared and your rights and choices regarding the information you provide to us.\nIf you see a capitalized word, it\u2019s defined in our Terms of Use.\nWe use cookies and similar technologies, as described in our Cookie

us;</li>\n<li>Information you provide for identity verification purposes when fulfilling a dare, including your legal name, business name and Tax ID for business entities, and date of birth.\nIn some cases, our payment processor will request that you provide a secure upload of an identity document (such as your passport, drivers license or other government-issued ID) to Dare Drop;</li>\n<li>Details of any requests or transactions you make through the Services.\nDare Drop partners with other companies (such as PayPal) for payment processing, and the payment information you submit is collected and used by them in accordance with their privacy policies (for PayPal\u2019s, click here).\nDare Drop doesn\u2019t store your payment information apart from the last four digits

problem).\nand</li>\n<li>Information that you submit on or to Dare Drop in the form of comments, contributions to discussions, or messages to other users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may decline to provide us

adjust your pledge, save payment details for future pledges, make dare comments and take most other actions on our Site, you will need to finish creating an account.\nYou may review, change or remove your information through your account settings.</p>How We Use This Information<p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To keep your account secure and protect our Services (including to verify the identities of creators and prevent fraud and abuse);</li>\n<li>To enable us to provide you with our Services, and to improve and promote our Services;</li>\n<li>To create and administer your account, contact you, and customize your experience on Dare Drop (for example, to show you dares that we think may interest you based on your previous use).\nand</li>\n<li>To track and analyze use of the Services so that we can improve how Dare Drop is performing and provide users with the best experience possible.</li>\n</ul>European Union Users<p>Data protection law in Europe requires a \u201clawful basis\u201d for collecting and retaining personal information from citizens or residents of the European Economic Area.\nOur lawful bases include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Performing the contract we have with you: In certain circumstances, we need your personal data to comply with our contractual obligation to deliver the Services, enable creators to establish and display their dares, and enable backers to find and make pledges to them.</li>\n<li>Legal compliance: Sometimes the law says we need to collect and use your data.\nFor example, tax laws require us to retain records of pledges and payments made through our Services.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: This is a technical term in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your data and we do so in ways which do not hurt your interests and rights.\nWe sometimes require your data to pursue our legitimate interests n a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.</p>\n<p>For example, we use identity, device, and location information to prevent fraud and abuse and to keep the Services secure.\nWe may also send you promotional communications about our Services, subject to your right to control whether we do so.</p>\n<p>We analyze how users interact with our Site so we can understand better what elements of the design are working well and which are not working so well.\nThis allows us to improve and develop the quality of the online experience we offer all our users.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>How This Information Is Shared<p>\n<strong> Information that\u2019s shared publicly</strong>When you create an account, we create a basic profile page for you on Dare Drop, containing your username, the date the account was created, and a list of dares you have funded or completed.\nYour profile is private.\nYour username appears with dares you create or claim on Dare Drop.</p>\n<p>Creators are also asked to verify their identities before claiming a dare.\nOnce this has been done, the creator\u2019s Verified Name will be publicly displayed on their account profile and on any dares they create or claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Information that isn\u2019t shared publicly</strong>The following data will not be publicly displayed or revealed to other users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any payment information you provide;</li>\n<li>Your password details;</li>\n<li>Your IP address;</li>\n<li>Your phone number;</li>\n<li>Your date of birth and other identity verification documentation (for creators).\nand</li>\n<li>Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Information that\u2019s shared with trusted third-party services</strong>We may share your information with certain trusted third-party services to help us provide, improve, promote, or protect Dare Drop\u2019s Services (like when we partner with payment processors, or use services that help us manage our ads on other sites).\nWhen we share data with third-party services that support our delivery of the Dare Drop Services, we require that they use your information only for the purposes we\u2019ve authorized, and that they protect your personal information at least to the same standards we do.\nWe may also share information that\u2019s aggregated and anonymized in a way that it doesn\u2019t directly identify you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information that\u2019s shared with creators and collaborators</strong>When you back a dare, the dare\u2019s deliverer will know your username, and the amount you have pledged.\nDeliverers never receive backers\u2019 credit card details or other payment information.</p>\n<p>If a dare you have backed is successfully funded, the creator will receive the email address associated with your Dare Drop account.\nThey may also send you a survey requesting information needed to provide any reward.\n(For instance, they may need your mailing address, or T-shirt size.) Any information you provide in such surveys will be received by the deliverer.</p>\n<p>Deliverers are required to keep backer information confidential, except as strictly necessary to communicate with backers directly and fulfill rewards.\nDelverers should not ask for personal information that isn\u2019t necessary to provide your reward, and should never request sensitive personal information such as your Social Security number or payment information.\nContact us at support@DareDrop.com if you receive a request for information that seems inappropriate or excessive</p>\n<p>Collaborators are third parties that deliverers can appoint to help manage their dare.\nThese collaborators may be able to access the information available to deliverers (including backers\u2019 names, email addresses, pledge amounts, messages, and survey responses), and are required to treat backers\u2019 personal information with the same care and respect as deliverers are.</p>\n<p>Deliverers and their collaborators may also receive routine traffic analytics about their dare pages.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information that\u2019s shared to protect Dare Drop and comply with the law</strong>We do reserve the right to disclose personal information when we believe that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or law enforcement, to prevent fraud or abuse, or to protect Dare Drop\u2019s legal rights, property, or the safety of Dare Drop, its employees, users, or others.</p>TOS for Links<p>\n<strong>Links to other websites and services</strong>Our Site may include links to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from Dare Drop\u2019s.\nWhen you use a link to an external site or service, the privacy policy and data processing disclosures for that site or service governs.</p>Data Retention<p>We will retain your information as long as your account is active, as necessary to provide you with the Services or as otherwise set forth in this Policy.\nWe will also retain and use this information as necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy and to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and protect Dare Drop\u2019s legal rights.</p>\n<p>We also collect and maintain aggregated, anonymized or pseudonymized information which we may retain indefinitely to protect the safety and security of our Site, improve our Services or comply with legal obligations.</p>Data Transfers<p>Because Dare Drop is a US-based company, your information will be collected and processed in the United States.\nThe United States has its own laws governing data protection and government access to information.\nThe rules that protect your personal information under United States law may be different than in your home country.\nIf you choose to use the Services, you need to agree to our Terms of Use, which set out the contract between Dare Drop and its users.</p>Your Rights<p>Users residing in certain countries, including the EU, are afforded certain rights regarding their personal information.\nExcept where an exception or exemption applies, these rights include the ability to access, correct, and request deletion of your personal information.\nThese rights are not applicable globally.</p>\n<p>You can request a downloadable copy of your personal data from Dare Drop from your account settings page.\nTo modify or delete the personal information you\u2019ve provided to us, please log in and update your profile.\nWe may retain certain information as required by law or as necessary for our legitimate business purposes.</p>Email and Mobile Notifications<p>We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us.\nWe try to keep emails to a minimum and give you the ability to opt in to any marketing communications we send.</p>\n<p>We will send you email relating to your transactions on Dare Drop.\nYou may also elect to receive certain marketing email communications, in accordance with your preferences, and from which you may opt out at any time.\nWe\u2019ll also send you service-related announcements when it\u2019s necessary to do so.</p>Security<p>We take security seriously, and the security of your personal data is important to us.\nWe follow industry-standard practices to protect the data we collect and maintain, including using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to encrypt information as it travels over the internet.\nNo method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so Dare Drop cannot guarantee its absolute security.\nYour account information is protected by a password, which you should choose carefully and keep secure.</p>\n<p>We encourage the responsible disclosure of

algorithms.</li>\n</ul>4.\nHow Dares Work<p>Most of our Terms of Service explain your relationship with Dare Drop.\nThis section is different \u2014 it explains the relationship between creators and backers of Dare Drop Dares, and who\u2019s responsible for what.\nThis is what you\u2019re agreeing to when you create, fund, or deliver results for a Dare Drop Dare.</p>\n<p>Dare Drop provides a funding platform for creative Dares.\nWhen a creator fulfills a Dare on Dare Drop or a funder backs a Dare on Dare Drop, they\u2019re inviting other people to form a contract with them.\nAnyone who delivers the result for a Dare is accepting the creator\u2019s and funder\u2019s offer, and forming that contract</p>\n<p>Dare Drop is not a part of this contract \u2014 the contract is a direct legal agreement between creators and backers.\nHere are the terms that govern that agreement:</p>\n<p>When a Dare is successfully completed, <b>the funders must pay their pledged amounts to the deliverer</b>.\nOnce a funder has done so, they\u2019ve satisfied their obligation to the other funders and the deliverer.</p>\n<p>Throughout the process, deliverers owe their funders a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the Dare to life.\nAt the same time, funders must understand that when they fund a Dare, they\u2019re helping to create something.\nThere may be changes or delays, and there\u2019s a chance something could happen that prevents a deliverer from being able to finish the Dare as requested.</p>\n<p>The deliverers are each solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their claimed Dare.\nIf they\u2019re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by the funders.</p>5.\nHow Funding Works<p>This section goes over the details of funding and creating Dares.\nThis is how money gets collected, and the details on how and when pledges can be changed or canceled.</p>\n<p>These are the terms that apply when you\u2019re funding or creating a Dare:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You\u2019re only charged if the Dare is completed.\nYou\u2019ll provide your payment information when you pledge, but you won\u2019t be charged.\nYour payment will only be collected if, at the time of the Dare\u2019s funding deadline, the Dare has been completed.\nThe exact amount you pledged is the amount Dare Drop will collect.\nIf the Dare hasn\u2019t been completed, you won\u2019t be charged, and no money will change hands.</li>\n<li>In some cases we\u2019ll reserve the charge on your card.\nDare Drop and its payment partners may authorize or reserve a charge on your credit card (or whatever payment method you use) for any amount up to the full pledge, at any time between the pledge and the collection of funds.</li>\n<li>You can increase, decrease, or cancel your pledge at any time during the Dare, with one exception.\nDuring the last 24 hours before the Dare is completed, you can\u2019t decrease or

Dare, then you may not cancel or decrease your pledge.</li>\n<li>Dare Drop doesn\u2019t offer refunds.\nResponsibility for finishing a Dare lies entirely with the Dare deliverer.\nDare Drop

the full amount pledged minus fees.</li>\n<li>\n<b>We\u2019ll help resolve payment-card disputes</b>.\nIf a backer of your Dare disputes the charge with their card issuer, we\u2019ll handle re-presenting the charge to settle the dispute with the card issuer.\nYou\u2019ll be notified that a dispute has been filed, and you\u2019ll be able to provide evidence to help us resolve it in your favor.\nIf the cardholder\u2019s dispute is found valid, you authorize us to charge the credit card number you provided when you completed the Dare for the amount of the chargeback.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Don\u2019t count your chickens before they hatch</b>.\nDon\u2019t assume you\u2019ll be able to deliver on a Dare when you want.\nthere could be a reason we\u2019re not able to accept it, or a problem that takes time to resolve.\nDon\u2019t assume you\u2019ll be able to immediately collect your funding.\nthere may be a delay between the end of a successful Dare and your

it.</li>\n</ul>6.\nTerms Applicable to Developers, Brands, and Publishers<p>This section applies to those who use the site to promote a brand, product, or service using a campaign.\nThis includes all
