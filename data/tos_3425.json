Collect</strong>.\nWe collect two basic types of information from our Users:</p>\n<p>(a) <strong>Personal Data</strong>:</p>\n<p>(i) <strong>What is Personal Data?</strong> Personal Data is information that pertains to you specifically, and can help identify you as a person.\nIn some cases, we may ask (or require) you to provide us with some elements of Personal Data (such as your email address and password) when you establish your account.\nIn other cases, you may provide certain types of Personal Data to us (and other users) when you use the Service.</p>\n<p>(ii) <strong>When and How do we collect it?</strong> We collect Personal Data from Users when they establish and use their Juicer accounts.\nWe do not collect Personal Data from Viewers.\nWe may collect Posts as part of the aggregation process.\nThese Posts were made public by the Content Creators and generally do not contain Personal Data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Establishing an Account:</strong> When you establish an account you must provide us with an email address and a password.\nIf you sign up for a paid account, you must also provide your name and payment information (i.e., credit card or Paypal account ID).\nWe do not, however, store or \u201csee\u201d payment information, as it is passed directly to the applicable payment processing company listed in Section 4(a) of this

available to other Viewers regardless of whether they are connected to you via Facebook.</p>\n<p>When you (the User) logs on to your Juicer account, we will record your IP address and/or unique mobile device identifier and may tie it to your specific account.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not Personal Data under the standard definition of the term.\nHowever, it may become Personal Data when it is combined with other information.</p>\n<p>When you embed a Juicer feed into your site, Viewers will be served static assets (image and video files) directly from the Social Media Networks servers.\nWhile Juicer does not transfer any personal data to the Social Media Networks, the data that the Social Media Networks record while serving static assets to the Viewer is subject to the Social Media Network's privacy policy</p>\n<p>(iii) <strong>How do we use Personal Data</strong>?
