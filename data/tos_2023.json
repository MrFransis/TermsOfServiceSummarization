be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith.\nJudgment upon

any dispute against the other in our respective individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative proceeding or as an association.\nIn addition, we each agree that disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.\nThe arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.</b>\n</p>\n<p>If any part of this provision is ruled to be unenforceable, then the balance of this provision shall remain in full effect and construed and enforced as if the portion ruled unenforceable were not contained herein.</p>\nAdditional Disclosures\n<p>No waiver by either you or Transifex of any breach or default or failure to exercise any right allowed under these Terms is a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default or a waiver or forfeiture of any similar or future rights under these Terms.\nThe section headings used herein are for convenience only and

state of the European Economic Area (i.e.\nEU, Norway, Lichtenstein, Iceland) and pursuant to applicable data privacy legislation, &nbsp;we shall make sure that you exercise the following rights:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You have the right to access the information we hold about you.\nYou can contact us and we shall inform you about:\n<ul>\n<li>The categories of data we\u2019re processing.</li>\n<li>The purposes of data processing.</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties to whom the data may be disclosed.</li>\n<li>How long the data will be stored (or the criteria used to determine that period).</li>\n<li>Other rights you have regarding our use of your information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You have the right to ask us to correct or rectify personal information about you if they are inaccurate or incomplete.\n</li>\n<li>You can object to us using your information for profiling you or making automated decisions about you.\nPlease note that exercising this right does not equal to an obligation on our behalf to not show advertisements at all.\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li>You have the right to ask us to directly transfer your information to another service, as long as it is technically feasible or to provide you a copy in a common machine-readable format.\nPlease note that if such information also contains personal data about another person, we may not choose to include such data in our deliverables.</li>\n<li>You have the right to be \u2018forgotten\u2019.\nAll you have to do is ask and we will delete your information unless we have another legal reason to hold your personal information (such as a legal claim or a regulatory requirement).</li>\n<li>You can ask us not to use your information for direct marketing purposes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can exercise all the aforementioned rights by emailing us at privacy@transifex.com.\nWe shall address your request within 30 days of its receipt unless it is too complicated or we are dealing simultaneously with too many such requests.\nIn the latter case, it may take us up to two additional months to address your request, but we will let you know if that is the case within 30 days of the receipt of your initial request.</p>\n<p>Please note that exercising the above rights presupposes that we have collected such personal information ourselves and/or process them for our own purposes.\nIf these data have been entrusted to us by third parties while we are providing our services to them (for example while customers upload content on our platforms) we are only processing such data on their behalf and under their instructions (we are processors under EU Law).\nAccordingly, if we receive a request from you to exercise your right we are not obliged to address it since such a request should be forwarded to our customers instead (controllers).</p>\n<p>When we share some information with third parties, some personal data may be processed, transferred or stored outside of the EU or the EEA (please see the section titled \u201cHow do we share your information?\u201d).\nTo that extent, we take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy and require that any third parties outside the EU or the EEA that have access to your personal data provide us with appropriate safeguards for your information.</p>\n<p>We would be happy to spend the time and effort necessary to address any of your privacy concerns, however, if you believe that your rights have not been properly addressed you can file a complaint regarding our use of your information to the Data Protection Authority of your habitual residence or place of work.</p>\n<b>6.\nWord Retention</b>\n<p>We will retain your information, which may include general personal information, for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.\nIf you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account.\nWe may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\nConsistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request.\nPlease note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion.\nIn addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.</p>\n<b>7.\nTransifex Community</b>\n<p>Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and wikis.\nYou should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.\nYour posts may remain even after you cancel your account.\nFor questions about your Personal Information on our Service, please contact privacy@transifex.com.</p>\n<p>Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Transifex.\nIf you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements.\nWe cannot control or be held responsible for third parties\u2019 privacy practices and content.\nPlease read their privacy policies to find out how they collect and process your personal data.</p>\n<b>8.\nSecurity</b>\n<p>The security of your information is important to us.\n&nbsp;We thus implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to help protect the security of your information.\n</p>\n<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\nNo method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however.\nTherefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>\n<p>When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>\n<p>We have implemented various policies including pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.</p>\n<p>Your password protects your user account, so we encourage you to use a unique and strong password, limit access to your computer and browser, and log out after having used the Transifex Service.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at security@transifex.com.</p>\n<b>9.\nOur Policy Toward Children</b>\n<p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 18.\nWe do not knowingly collect personal data / personally identifiable information from children under 18.\nIf a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@transifex.com.\nIf we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.</p>\n<b>10.\nChanges to our Privacy Policy</b>\n<p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time.\nIf we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email).\nAnd we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well.\nBy continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading our Privacy
