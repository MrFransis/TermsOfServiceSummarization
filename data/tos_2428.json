then-current fee for your account type.\nSome Prezi accounts are offered with a free trial period.\nSuch free trials are limited to one-per-user.\nUsers must not fraudulently obtain (or attempt to obtain) additional trial periods beyond the single free trial term.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>If your account began with a free trial, the current fee for the account type you have selected will automatically and immediately be charged to your payment instrument or account on the date your free trial expires.\nIf your account did not begin with a free trial, the current fee for the account type you have selected will automatically and immediately be charged to your payment instrument or account on the date you signed up and then every 30 or 365 days after (depending on the billing cycle which applies to your account).\nFees charged for one account type may not be credited towards other account types.\nAll currency references are in U.S.\ndollars.</b>\n</p>\n<b>8.2 FRAUD PROTECTIONS</b>\n<p>\n<b>To protect against potential fraud, Prezi may take steps to verify the validity of the credit card information you provide to us.\nThe verification process may include debiting an amount between $0.01 and $0.99 from your credit card account and then immediately crediting the same amount back to your credit card, as well as asking you to verify the amount debited in order to confirm that you are in possession of your credit card.\nPrezi will only use this process to screen for fraud and will not otherwise debit your credit card account except as part of a transaction conducted through your account for the Service.\nBy providing Prezi with your credit card information, you authorize Prezi to debit and credit your credit card account for an amount less than one dollar for such verification purposes.\nPrezi may also engage third parties to provide fraud detection services.</b>\n</p>\n<b>8.3 CANCELLATION OF SUBSCRIPTION</b>\n<p>\n<b>Payment for subscriptions is non-refundable.\nIf you cancel your recurring payment option, your account will remain active until its next renewal date.\nIf you delete your account before the end of the term for which you paid, your cancellation will take effect immediately.\nIn either case (cancellation or deletion), you will not be given any refund.</b>\n</p>\n<b>8.4 TERMINATION</b>\n<p>\n<b>If your payment method is invalid or rejected for any reason and a free Prezi Public version of your paid Prezi account type is available, your paid Prezi account will revert to the free Prezi Public account version and will be subject to the limitations of a free Prezi Public account, provided, however, that Prezi reserves the right to cancel your account entirely in such case.\nYou will have the option of deleting any User Content from your account prior to its reversion to a Prezi Public account.\nIn the event your paid Prezi account reverts to a free Prezi Public account, any content you previously created with a paid Prezi account and designated as Private User Content will remain Private User Content, but you will not be able to edit such content.\nNew content you create with such an account will become Public User Content, which means any new content you create from that point forward is going to be public.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>If your paid Prezi account began with a free trial and you do not purchase a subscription to the same or an upgraded version of those services before the end of the trial period, your paid Prezi account will automatically terminate at the end of the trial period.\nIf your paid Prezi account is terminated for any reason or expires, any content you entered into the Service, and any customizations made to the Service by or for you, which are associated with your paid Prezi account will become unavailable.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Prezi further reserves the right to cancel, or revert to Prezi Public account status, the account of any user who attempts to fraudulently obtain Prezi educational pricing.</b>\n</p>\n<b>8.5&nbsp;OTHER PAYMENT PROVISIONS</b>\n<b>8.5.1 Argentina</b>\n<p>\n<b>You grant&nbsp;Prezi, and any and all payment processors which may

than a lawsuit in court.\nIt uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.&nbsp;Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.&nbsp;Any arbitration will take place on an individual basis.\nclass arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.\nWhether to agree to

Incident Event Management (SIEM)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our SIEM solution collects, processes, and correlates detailed logs from our cloud infrastructure, from the nodes running on it, and from the applications themselves.\nThe security team operates as a security operations center and is responsible for monitoring and responding to both internal and external threats.\nThe team responds on an ongoing basis to automated alerts opened by different detection mechanisms (e.g.\nAWS GuardDuty, AWS Macie, AWS usage logs, threat detection alerts from the infrastructure through Sysdig Falco, detailed security relevant logs from infrastructure components, web security related logs, etc.)</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Web Application Firewall (WAF)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use a next-gen web application firewall solution in blocking mode as a first line of defense in front of all customer-facing web traffic.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Encryption in transit</strong>\n</p>\n<p>By default, we use TLS encryption between the Prezi client (either the browser or our desktop/iOS/Android application) and the server.\nTLS connection is also set up between servers running in different regions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Load balancers are used to terminate TLS with automatic issuance of certificates with strong security parameters (2048-bit RSA public keys with SHA256+RSA signature algorithm).</p>\n<p>TLS is also supported for all email communications we have with our customers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Encryption at rest</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Critical customer data (Prezi XMLs and media assets) created after February, 2018 is encrypted on the server side with AES-256.\nThe encryption is transparent.\nkeys are managed by our cloud infrastructure provider.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Datacenter</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use a top-tier third-party cloud service provider that is compliant with numerous regulations and privacy standards (EU General Data Protection Regulation, HIPAA, GLBA, HITECH), and possesses industry-recognized certifications (SOC, PCI, FedRAMP, ISO and more).&nbsp;</p> &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nApplication security <p>\n<strong>Security reviews</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To highlight potential security risks as early as possible, all architectural plans are reviewed by the Security Team.\nOn a case-by-case basis, the Security Team also executes threat-modeling exercises in partnership with the engineering teams involved.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Security Team interacts on a daily basis with developers and engineers to share security mindset, best practices, and efficient tools.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Static code analysis</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are supporting our secure software development lifecycle with tools that automatically detect code changes against security best practices.\nThe Security Team reviews all code changes flagged as potential risks, keeps track of open issues, and communicates with engineers to share security-related knowledge and best practices on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-Party Penetration tests</strong>\n</p>\n<p>At least on an annual basis, we engage with an independent third-party auditor company to perform an infrastructure- and application-level penetration test.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Responsible Disclosure Program</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As a result of our public Responsible Disclosure Program (https://prezi.com/bug-bounty/), both our infrastructure and application are continuously scanned by vulnerability scanners and enthusiastic security researchers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Auditing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We have detailed user activity logging, including (but not limited to) security-related events like login, password change, presentation creation/deletion/modification, privacy settings, and access rights changes at the application level.</p> &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nProduct security <p>\n<strong>Sharing prezis and
