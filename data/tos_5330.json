ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.\nFOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE PROVISIONS REQUIRING YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.\n</p>\n<p>(A) <em>Disputes.</em> The terms of this Section shall apply to all Disputes between you and Hitnamer.com :(-):, except for disputes governed by the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy referenced above and available here.\nFor the purposes of this Section, \u201cDispute\u201d shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and Hitnamer.com :(-): arising under or relating to any Hitnamer.com :(-): Services or Products, Hitnamer.com :(-):\u2019s websites, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and Hitnamer.com :(-):, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law.\nYOU AND Hitnamer.com :(-): AGREE THAT \u201cDISPUTE\u201d AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR Hitnamer.com :(-): FOR (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION.\nMoreover, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.\n</p>\n<p>(B) <em>Binding Arbitration.</em> You and Hitnamer.com :(-): further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms.\n(ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce.\n(iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a71, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\nand (iv) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms.\nARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED.\nThe arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 19 of this Agreement and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nIn addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nThe decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.</p>\n<p>(C) <em>Small Claims Court.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court\u2019s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</p>\n<p>(D) <em>Dispute Notice.</em> In the event of a Dispute, you or Hitnamer.com :(-): must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the \u201cDispute Notice\u201d).\nThe Dispute Notice to Hitnamer.com :(-): must be addressed to: Hitnamer.com :(-):, 2150 E Warner Rd., Tempe, AZ 85284, Attn.: Legal Department (the \u201cHitnamer.com :(-): Notice Address\u201d).\nThe Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you.\nIf Hitnamer.com :(-): and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or Hitnamer.com :(-): may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section.\nFollowing submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n(E) <em>WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.</em> YOU AND Hitnamer.com :(-): AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS.\nNEITHER YOU NOR Hitnamer.com :(-): WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.\nNO ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(F) <em>Arbitration Procedure.</em> If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) and governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d) in conjunction with the rules set forth in these Terms, except that AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims.\nThe AAA Rules are at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nIf there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms shall govern.\nYou may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 19 of this Agreement.\nAll Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator is bound by these Terms.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.\nThe arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nNotwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of \u201cDisputes\u201d as stated above.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nYou may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone.\nArbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence (or principal place of business if you are a small business), or in Maricopa County, Arizona, at your option.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(G) <em>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding.</em> If either you or Hitnamer.com :(-): decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to the following procedure:</p>\n<p>i.\nWrite a Demand for Arbitration.\nThe demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.\nYou can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org (\u201cDemand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules\u201d).</p>\n<p>ii.\nSend one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA by mail at American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.\n</p>\n<p>iii.\nSend one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(H) <em>Hearing Format.</em> In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Hitnamer.com :(-): or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Hitnamer.com :(-): is entitled.\nThe discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(I) <em>Arbitration Fees and Payments.</em>\n</p>\n<p>i.\nDisputes involving $75,000.00 or less.\nHitnamer.com :(-): will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\nIf you reject Hitnamer.com :(-):\u2019s last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed (\u201cHitnamer.com :(-):\u2019s last written offer\u201d), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator\u2019s decision (called an \u201caward\u201d), and the arbitrator awards you more than Hitnamer.com :(-):\u2019s last written offer, Hitnamer.com :(-): will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.00.\n(ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, if any.\nand (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.\nThe arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and Hitnamer.com :(-): agree on them.</p>\n<p>ii.\nDisputes involving more than $75,000.00.\nThe AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.</p>\n<p>iii.\nDisputes involving any amount.\nIn any arbitration you commence, Hitnamer.com :(-): will seek its AAA or arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.\nIn any arbitration Hitnamer.com :(-): commences, Hitnamer.com :(-): will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\nHitnamer.com :(-): will not seek its attorney\u2019s fees or expenses from you in any arbitration.\nFees and expenses are not included in determining the

within one year in small claims or in arbitration.\nThe one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.\nIf not filed within one year, the claim or dispute will be

or buy any business or assets (whether a result of liquidation, bankruptcy or otherwise), in which case we will disclose your data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or

provided us in Account Settings or those collected through cookie technologies to personalize ads and improve your overall experience with us on our site and other sites.\nWe call this ad personalization (formerly, interest-based advertising) because the ads you see are based on previously collected or historical data to determine which ad will be most relevant to you, including data such as previous search queries, activity, visits to sites or apps, demographic information, or location.\nTo illustrate ad personalization that is audience-based, let\u2019s say you registered a domain with us and created a website using our website builder product.\nThe next time you navigate to our advertising partner\u2019s platform or website, they may recognize that you are a GoDaddy customer via a matched email and may use that data to help us display an ad about our latest promotion for website security.\nAlternatively, if you already purchased our website security product, then we may exclude you from future ad campaigns for this product because it wouldn\u2019t be relevant to you.\nOther ad personalization could be activity-based.\nFor example, using data about your page views on our site to determine whether an ad would be of interest to you.\nThe information we share with our advertising channel partners to deliver you personalized ads is done securely and cannot be used by them for any other purpose.\nWe do not sell your data to any third parties.\nIn addition, the data we share is hashed and encrypted, which means that it does not directly identify you.\nWe do not sell your data in any way to our partners or other third parties.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>To manage your preferences for audience-based ad personalization, please sign into your Account and visit \u201cAccount Settings.\u201d To manage your preferences for activity-based ad personalization, please visit our Cookie Policy.\nand go to \u201cManage Settings.\u201d If you opt-out of ad personalization, you may continue to receive ads, but those ads may be less relevant to you.</p>\n<p>For more information about ad personalization on your desktop or mobile browser, and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit one of the following: the Network Advertising Initiative website, the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) website, the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices Preference Manager.\nTo learn more about ad personalization in mobile apps and to opt out of this type of advertising by third parties that participate in the DAA\u2019s AppChoices tool, please use this URL: https://youradchoices.com/appchoices to download the version of AppChoices for your device.\nPlease note that any opt-out choice you exercise through these programs will only apply to ad personalization by the third parties you select, but will still allow the collection of data for other purposes, including research, analytics, and internal operations.\nYou may continue to receive ads, but those ads may be less relevant to you.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Communicating with you.</strong> We may contact you directly or through a third party service provider regarding products or services you have signed up or

information to the underlying domain registry operator and escrow provider, and publication of that information as required by ICANN in the public WHOIS database or with other third parties that demonstrate a legitimate legal interest to such information.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>How you can access, update or delete your data.</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>To easily access,
