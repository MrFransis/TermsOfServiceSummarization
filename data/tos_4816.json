Transfer\n<p>\n<b>The GDPR requires that when any EU user\u2019s personal data is hosted or processed outside of the European Economic Area, it must remain protected to an adequate standard in line with EU law.\nThere are a few ways that Kami achieves this:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>First</b>, some of our EU customers\u2019 data is processed in New Zealand (where our Headquarters are located).\nNew Zealand is recognized by the EU as a territory that ensures an adequate level of data protection decided by 2013/65/EU: Commission Implementing Decision of 19 December 2012 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data by New Zealand (notified under document C(2012) 9557) Text with EEA relevance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When we hold EU customer data in other territories, like the US, we take other \u2018Appropriate Safeguards\u2019 that are prescribed by the GDPR.\nSpecifically, we either transfer your data to countries which are providing adequate protection according to EU or we enter into Data Processing Agreements with Customers in which we rely on EU Standard Contractual Clauses (also called Model Clauses) published by the European Commission to protect EU data.\nThese are standard form data export agreements that have been approved by the European Commission as a lawful basis for transferring personal data to non-EEA countries like the USA.\nOur standard Data Processing Agreement is available and can be downloaded here to sign upon request.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Secondly</b>, When we hold EU customer data in other territories, like the USA, we take other \u2018Appropriate Safeguards\u2019 that are prescribed by the GDPR.\nSpecifically, we enter into Data Processing Agreements with Customers in which we rely on EU Standard Contractual Clauses (also called the SCCs or the EU Model Clauses) published by the European Commission to enforce the protection of EU users\u2019 data.\nThese are standard form data export agreements that have been approved by the European Commission as a lawful basis for transferring personal data to non-EEA countries like the USA.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our standard Data Processing Agreement incorporating the EU Model Clauses can be downloaded here to sign upon request, but is already incorporated into our Standard Terms of Service and applies to you.</p>\n<p>(Kami wants to notify you that since July 16, 2020 according to a decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the PrivacyShield&nbsp.\nagreement governing the transfer of EU citizens\u2019 data to the United States is no longer applicable.\nAs a result of that the EU-U.S.\nPrivacyShield Framework is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States.\nHowever as the regulatory and legislative landscape evolves, we will always work to ensure that our customers and partners can continue to enjoy the benefits of our services and maximum protections everywhere they operate.\nThis is the reason why we still continue to comply with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.)</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Thirdly</b>, we have verified that our US-based cloud hosting providers are working with us according to agreements which include SCC (EU Model clauses) as explained above.\nSpecifically,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Amazon Web Services</b> \u2013 our agreement with AWS incorporates the EU SCCs for GDPR-compliant protection of EU users\u2019 data as confirmed here.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Google</b>\n<b>Cloud Platform</b>&nbsp.\n\u2013 our agreement with GCP incorporates the EU SCCs for GDPR-compliant protection of EU users\u2019 data as confirmed here.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Groove</b> \u2013 our agreement with Groove incorporates a DPA using the EU SCCs for GDPR-compliant protection of EU users\u2019 data.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Stripe</b> \u2013 our agreement with Stripe incorporates the EU SCCs for GDPR-compliant protection of EU users\u2019 data here</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kami may not rely on a breach by a sub-processor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.</p> GDPR Rights of Arbitration <p>In case of a dispute or non-resolution related to privacy issues, European users may invoke binding arbitration via your EU data protection authority (DPAs).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Finally</b>, we have a <b>Designated Data Protection Representative</b> established in an EU member state, as required under the requirements of Article 27 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR).\nYou can contact our local EU representative here:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ILAC&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contact person: Ginka HRISTOVA&nbsp;</p>\n<p>E-Mail: dpo@dpa.bg</p> United Kingdom Privacy Rights <p>We comply with the data privacy requirements under the UK legislation.\nThere are interim provisions which allow the continued use of EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for restricted transfers.</p>\n<p>Our standard Data Processing Agreement incorporating the EU SCCs can be downloaded here to sign upon request, but is already incorporated into our Standard Terms of Service.</p> California Privacy Rights <p>In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California residents who provide Personal Information (as defined in the statute) to obtain educational services are entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about the Personal Information we shared, if any, with others third parties.\nIf applicable, this information would include the categories of Personal Information and the names and addresses of those third parties with which we shared such personal information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in the current year will receive information about the prior year).\nFor more information please contact us at: privacy@kamiapp.com</p>\n<p>\n</p> DO NOT TRACK\n<p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked.\nTracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a

users who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights.\nAccordingly, you may not store any material or content on, or disseminate any material or content over, the Products in any manner

qualify, in small claims court in New Zealand.\nEither party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Judicial forum for disputes \u2013</b> In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Kami agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be

or other casualty.</p> Waiver, Assignment and Severability <p>Waiver by Kami of any default or breach by you of any provision contained in this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default or breach of the same or any other provision of this Agreement.\nIf any part of this Agreement shall be held invalid, illegal, in conflict with any law, or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect.\nYou may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void.\nKami may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p> No Third Party Beneficiaries <p>The parties do not intend to confer any right or remedy on any third party.</p> Controlling Law <p>These Terms will be governed by New Zealand law except for its conflicts of laws principles.</p> Entire Agreement <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Kami with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms.\n</p> Modifications <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time, and will always post the most current version
