alternative to litigation that provides parties with an efficient way to resolve disputes.&nbsp.\nArbitration is similar to litigation, but happens outside the court system, using an arbitrator instead of a judge or jury to resolve the dispute.&nbsp.\nAgreement to arbitration is a required condition of your use of the Site.\nYou and Company agree that if any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Site, the Content, your User Content, these Terms, any of Company\u2019s actual or alleged intellectual property rights, or any Additional Terms (\u201cDispute\u201d), including questions about whether the Dispute is subject to arbitration, that Dispute shall be resolved according to this Section 11.\nYou and Company also agree that if the Dispute cannot be resolved informally under Section 11(A), it shall be resolved by binding arbitration before Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.\n(\u201cJAMS\u201d), an independent national arbitration association, in accordance with JAMS\u2019 rules.&nbsp.\nInformation about JAMS and its rules can be found at&nbsp;www.jamsadr.com&nbsp;or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267.<br>\n<br>If there is an arbitration, Company will pay for the arbitrator and the forum.&nbsp;Regardless of whether you or Company initiate the arbitration, Company will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including JAMS\u2019 fees and the fees for the arbitrator\u2019s services.&nbsp;However, Company will not pay and you will be responsible for your attorneys\u2019 fees if you choose to be represented by an attorney.<br>\n<br>Company desires a fair process, and the arbitration will meet the standards set by JAMS designed to ensure a fair hearing, including the selection of an independent, neutral arbitrator who has no relationship with Company or its management.\nYou agree that, notwithstanding any provision in these terms regarding applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted under this Section 11 shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) (9 U.S.\nCode \u00a7\u00a7 1-16).\nThis Section 11 can only be amended by mutual agreement.<br>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Informal Effort to Resolve Disputes</strong>.\nIf a Dispute arises, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution.\nOur notice will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.\nIf we have no contact information for you or if the information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 11(A).\nYour notice to us must be sent to:&nbsp;<strong>info@healthy-first.org</strong>.\nFor a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Company and you will communicate to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though nothing requires either you or Company to resolve the Dispute on terms which you and Company, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Binding Arbitration</u>\n</strong>.\nIf we cannot resolve a Dispute informally under Section 11(A) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.\nBY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY.</li>\n<li>A Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration administered by JAMS, in accordance with JAMS\u2019 then-current Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\u201cRules\u201d).\nTo start the arbitration process, Company or you will send a written request for arbitration to JAMS at 8401 N.\nCentral Expressway, Suite 610, Dallas, TX 75225 by U.S.\nmail or a reputable overnight delivery service (for example, Federal Express).&nbsp;You must also send a copy of any arbitration request to us at&nbsp;<strong>info@healthy-first.org</strong>&nbsp;so that we are aware of the arbitration and can pay JAMS\u2019 fee.&nbsp;JAMS will select a location for the arbitration, according to its procedural standards, that will be convenient for you.&nbsp;An arbitrator will be selected and govern the process, and he or she will issue a final and binding arbitration award.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Limited Time to File Claims</u>\n</strong>.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST INITIATE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 11(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES \u2013 OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.\n\u201cInitiating\u201d means, as applicable: (a) by delivery of written notice as set forth above in Section 11(A).\nor (b) filing for arbitration with JAMS as set forth in Section 11(B).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThe parties expressly waive any contrary statute of limitations or time bars, both legal and equitable, to a Dispute.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Injunctive Relief</u>\n</strong>.\nThe foregoing provisions of this Section 11 will not apply to any claim by you or Company seeking an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User Content and/or Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, Company\u2019s operations, and/or Company\u2019s products or services.&nbsp.\nThis Section 11 shall apply to any claims brought by you or Company in any action that do not seek such injunctive or equitable relief.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>No Class Actions</u>\n</strong>.\nYOU AGREE TO FILE ONE ARBITRATION THAT INCLUDES ALL OF YOUR DISPUTES AND JOINS ALL KNOWN DISPUTES.&nbsp.\nFURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT ANY ACTION YOU BRING SHALL BE INDIVIDUALLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF AND THAT YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO BRING A DISPUTE ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS IN ANY FORUM, WHETHER IT BE IN ARBITRATION OR IN A COURT.\nTHE ARBITRATOR SHALL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO FORM A CLASS OR PROCEED ON A COLLECTIVE BASIS.&nbsp.\nThere shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated.\nBut if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 11(B) to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 11(F).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Federal and State Courts in Miami Dade County, Florida</u>\n</strong>.\nExcept where arbitration is required above, small claims actions, or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute arising hereunder may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Miami-Dade County, Florida.\nAccordingly, you and Company consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Jury Trial Waiver</u>.\nYOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE (AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS) THAT YOU BRING IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HEARD BY A JURY.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement</u>\n</strong>.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring a Dispute in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction, provided the claim qualifies to be heard in such small claims court.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>DISCLAIMER OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE IS
